      "Content": "Worried About an AI Bubble? Buy This Tech Stock in 2026.\n\nBen Gran, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 6:38 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points An estimated 75% of stock market returns since November 2022 have come from AI stocks.\nIn the past six months, Apple has outperformed most AI stocks.\nApple is expecting 10%-12% revenue growth in its current quarter, with strong iPhone sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been driving some of the biggest gains in the stock market in recent years. A report from JP Morgan Asset Management found that ever since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns. Major tech companies like Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in high-powered chips and vast data centers to build the infrastructure of AI, which they hope will lead the next transformative wave of innovation and economic growth.\n\nBut in the past few months, some investors have turned skeptical about the AI stock story. In August 2025, an MIT study was published showing that 95% of generative AI projects at businesses failed to deliver a measurable return on investment. This MIT study was a potential warning sign to investors. If businesses can't figure out how to use AI to make money, save money, or be more productive and efficient, all of this AI capital expenditure (capex) spending by these major tech companies might not pay off, and would be halted.\nSome investors are concerned that AI companies are spending too much on capital expenditures for AI, that AI is not demonstrating enough clear real-world use cases and profitable product opportunities, and that the expected returns on all of this AI capex might not arrive. The AI boom might turn into an AI bubble .\n\nThe good news is that no matter what happens next with AI companies, you can still invest in a major tech stock that might not be affected by a possible AI bubble. Here's a closer look at why this company could be a good stock to buy in 2026.\nApple is outside of any AI bubble Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the world's largest and most influential tech companies, but it's not an \"AI company\" or an \"AI stock\" in the same way as Oracle , Nvidia , Microsoft, or Alphabet is. That's because Apple's not spending nearly as much on AI as these other companies, and Apple's business model doesn't depend on the future promise of AI. In fact, earlier in 2025, Apple was widely criticized for not moving fast enough on AI and being \"behind\" on AI strategy.\n\nBut Apple's patient approach to AI might turn out to be a good thing for Apple shareholders. Apple has managed to avoid getting dragged into a costly AI arms race. Instead of plowing billions of dollars into data centers, Apple has focused on its core business of selling phones and laptops. If you're worried that valuations of AI stocks have gone too high, but you don't want to give up on \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, Apple could be a good choice.\n\nStory Continues\nApple is poised to thrive in 2026 During the past six months, Apple stock is up roughly 33% while the S&P 500 is up 11%. Apple also outperformed major AI stocks like Nvidia and Oracle, and other AI-related tech stocks like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. The launch of the iPhone 17 in September 2025 was a huge success, generating blockbuster demand. Apple is expected to ship 247.4 million iPhones in 2025, a 6.1% year-over-year increase, according to IDC.\nOn its most recent earnings call, in October, Apple announced record-breaking numbers. The company earned $416 billion of revenue in its fiscal year 2025 (an all-time record), and its fourth-quarter revenue of $102.5 billion was an 8% year-over-year increase. iPhone revenue was up 6% year over year and hit a new September-ended quarter record. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.85, another September-ended quarter record, and up 13% year-over-year, excluding a one-time charge from 2024.\n\nApple's services revenue was up 15% year over year in the quarter, which is an all-time record. Services have become a major profit engine for Apple because the margins on digital services are so high compared to physical products. Apple's gross margin for services was about 75% in its latest earnings report, compared to 36% for Apple products.\nAnd the services segment is becoming a bigger slice of Apple's overall revenue. In its Q3 earnings for fiscal year 2025, Apple made more sales from services ($28.75 billion) than it made from all of its non-iPhone products combined (Macs, iPads and Wearables made $24.69 billion of sales).\nAnd there are good reasons for investor optimism about Apple to continue into 2026. The company expects to see 10%-12% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2026, with double-digit iPhone revenue growth. That quarter is wrapping up now and includes the holiday selling period. Analysts have raised their estimate for Apple's earnings per share to $2.67 for the current quarter, up from $1.77 for Q4 of Apple's fiscal 2025.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, Apple stock is not cheap compared to where its P/E ratio has been in the past few years. But if investors continue to shy away from high-priced AI stocks, and if more signs of real-world return on investment from AI don't materialize fast enough, Apple could look like a better deal than tech stocks that have more AI exposure.\nUnless some new must-have device gets invented that can replace the iPhone, Apple seems well-positioned to stay highly profitable for a long time to come. No matter what happens next with the possible AI bubble, Apple should be a good stock to buy in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?

      "Content": "Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Microsoft Corp\n\nGuruFocus News\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs MSFT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2026-01-01, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $454.72. It's currently trading at a price of $483.62. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -6.36%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$14.55\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.16%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 20.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n234.99\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n235.24\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n454.72\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $221.40. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -118.44%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Today, we are looking at automation software stocks, starting with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nThe whole purpose of software is to automate tasks to increase productivity. Today, innovative new software techniques, often involving AI and machine learning, are finally allowing automation that has graduated from simple one- or two-step workflows to more complex processes integral to enterprises. The result is surging demand for modern automation software.\n\nThe 7 automation software stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 4.4% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.\nWhile some automation software stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 3.3% since the latest earnings results.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Originally named \"Micro-soft\" for microcomputer software when founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global technology company that develops software, cloud services, devices, and AI solutions for consumers, businesses, and organizations worldwide.\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $77.67 billion, up 18.4% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with a narrow beat of analysts’ revenue estimates, as the beat in Intelligent Cloud and Business Services trumped the miss in Personal Computing and a solid beat of analysts’ revenue estimates.\n\"Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,\" said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.\nThe stock is down 11.1% since reporting and currently trades at $483.36.\nRead why we think that Microsoft is one of the best automation software stocks, our full report is free.\nBest Q3: Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) With a \"Center-out Business Architecture\" approach that transcends organizational silos, Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) develops software that helps organizations automate workflows and use artificial intelligence to improve customer experiences and business processes.\nPegasystems reported revenues of $381.4 million, up 17.3% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 8.5%. The business had a stunning quarter with a solid beat of analysts’ billings estimates and an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.\n\nStory Continues\nPegasystems pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems content with the results as the stock is up 4.7% since reporting. It currently trades at $59.73.\nIs now the time to buy Pegasystems?

Still, it was a softer quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and a miss of analysts’ billings estimates.\n\nAs expected, the stock is down 30.8% since the results and currently trades at $9.94.\nRead our full analysis of SoundHound AI’s results here.\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) Starting with robotic process automation (RPA) and evolving into a comprehensive automation powerhouse, UiPath (NYSE:PATH) provides an AI-powered business automation platform that enables organizations to create software robots that mimic human actions to streamline repetitive tasks and processes.\nUiPath reported revenues of $411.1 million, up 15.9% year on year. This print beat analysts’ expectations by 4.7%. Aside from that, it was a satisfactory quarter as it also produced an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates but a significant miss of analysts’ billings estimates.\n\nThe stock is up 8.8% since reporting and currently trades at $16.38.\nRead our full, actionable report on UiPath here, it’s free for active Edge members.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) Built on a single code base that processes over 4 billion workflow transactions daily, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations automate and digitize workflows across departments, from IT and HR to customer service and security.\nServiceNow reported revenues of $3.41 billion, up 21.8% year on year. This result topped analysts’ expectations by 1.4%. Taking a step back, it was a satisfactory quarter as it also logged a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates but a significant miss of analysts’ billings estimates.\n\nServiceNow had the weakest performance against analyst estimates among its peers. The stock is down 16.2% since reporting and currently trades at $152.85.\nRead our full, actionable report on ServiceNow here, it’s free for active Edge members.\nMarket Update As a result of the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

      "Content": "Microsoft shut down one of the most popular apps ever\n\nDaniel Kline\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:44 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nDuring Covid, my family struggled with Zoom meetings—some had cameras in awkward places, others couldn’t get their mics working.\nAt that time, I had been using Zoom for some work meetings and some broadcasting. I was also still using Microsoft Teams for certain meetings (most of which were with actual Microsoft employees), and I had a few colleagues who insisted on using Google Hangouts, a now-defunct product that never made a major mark.\n\nDuring that period, however, Zoom became the default video conferencing brand for a variety of reasons that may never have come to be had it not been for the pandemic forcing schools, families, and other non-business users to need a video conferencing solution.\nI even had one weekly meeting, a recording session for a podcast, that took place over Skype, Microsoft's second-tier videoconferencing system behind the emerging Teams.\nYou could argue that, of all the platforms named above, Skype was the biggest loser during the pandemic, as it was a consumer product, not solely a business one, like Teams or even Zoom before it evolved.\n\"At the beginning of 2020, Skype controlled 32.4 % of the market compared to Zoom’s 26.4%. But, by the following year, Skype dropped to only 6.6%,\" reported the Verticals podcast .\n\nCovid may not have directly killed Skype, but it certainly put a few bullets into its side as it died a slow death.\nZoom helped kill Skype \"Zoom’s success wasn’t merely a matter of timing. Several key factors helped it outpace competitors like Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Skype, according to the Times of Ireland .\nSimplicity : Zoom’s user interface was clean and intuitive. No complicated logins or software installations were required—users could join a meeting via a web link with no technical knowledge.\nReliability : Zoom’s infrastructure handled video and audio better than most competitors, especially under heavy loads. It adapted to varying bandwidths and delivered consistently strong performance.\nFreemium Model : Offering free 40-minute meetings made Zoom instantly accessible. Schools, families, and non-profits could use the service without upfront costs.\nScalability : Whether you were running a one-on-one interview or hosting a 1,000-person webinar, Zoom could adapt.\nBrand Identity : Much like “Google” became synonymous with internet search, “Zoom” became shorthand for online meetings. Few platforms achieved this branding triumph.\nMicrosoft's $8.5 billion mistake Microsoft actually has a history of costly mistakes, with the biggest arguably being its attempt to take on Apple's iPhone.\nNokia’s Mobile Phone Business (2013-2015) : Microsoft bought Nokia’s handset business for $7.2 billion (plus $1.6 billion for patent licensing) in hopes of boosting its smartphone presence, Microsoft shared in a press release .\nOutcome: The acquisition failed to revive Windows Phone, market share continued to collapse, and Microsoft wrote off nearly the entire purchase and laid off thousands of employees, Medium reported. “It was a mistake to begin with,” said Jack Gold, principal analyst at J. Gold Associates. “A monumental mistake. Microsoft had no business being in the cut-throat, low-margin phone business. Who’s making money in phones besides Apple?\" Jack Gold, principal analyst at J. Gold Associates, told Computerworld.\n\nThe Skype purchase, which cost the company $8.5 billion, is widely considered a misstep relative to Microsoft Teams’ success\nMore Tech Stocks:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\nMicrosoft, you can argue, was just as culpable as Zoom in killing Skype, because it clearly chose Teams as its biggest bet in videoconferencing.\n\"But Microsoft wanted — and still wants — [Teams] to be a Thing People Want To Use, which ultimately led to Skype taking a back seat as its features were gradually cannibalized to improve Teams.

      "Content": "Microsoft killed an $8.5 billion mistake in 2025\n\nDaniel Kline\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:44 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nDuring Covid, my family struggled with Zoom meetings—some had cameras in awkward places, others couldn’t get their mics working.\nAt that time, I had been using Zoom for some work meetings and some broadcasting. I was also still using Microsoft Teams for certain meetings (most of which were with actual Microsoft employees), and I had a few colleagues who insisted on using Google Hangouts, a now-defunct product that never made a major mark.\n\nDuring that period, however, Zoom became the default video conferencing brand for a variety of reasons that may never have come to be had it not been for the pandemic forcing schools, families, and other non-business users to need a video conferencing solution.\nI even had one weekly meeting, a recording session for a podcast, that took place over Skype, Microsoft's second-tier videoconferencing system behind the emerging Teams.\nYou could argue that, of all the platforms named above, Skype was the biggest loser during the pandemic, as it was a consumer product, not solely a business one, like Teams or even Zoom before it evolved.\n\"At the beginning of 2020, Skype controlled 32.4 % of the market compared to Zoom’s 26.4%. But, by the following year, Skype dropped to only 6.6%,\" reported the Verticals podcast .\n\nCovid may not have directly killed Skype, but it certainly put a few bullets into its side as it died a slow death.\nZoom helped kill Skype \"Zoom’s success wasn’t merely a matter of timing. Several key factors helped it outpace competitors like Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Skype, according to the Times of Ireland .\nSimplicity : Zoom’s user interface was clean and intuitive. No complicated logins or software installations were required—users could join a meeting via a web link with no technical knowledge.\nReliability : Zoom’s infrastructure handled video and audio better than most competitors, especially under heavy loads. It adapted to varying bandwidths and delivered consistently strong performance.\nFreemium Model : Offering free 40-minute meetings made Zoom instantly accessible. Schools, families, and non-profits could use the service without upfront costs.\nScalability : Whether you were running a one-on-one interview or hosting a 1,000-person webinar, Zoom could adapt.\nBrand Identity : Much like “Google” became synonymous with internet search, “Zoom” became shorthand for online meetings. Few platforms achieved this branding triumph.\nMicrosoft's $8.5 billion mistake Microsoft actually has a history of costly mistakes, with the biggest arguably being its attempt to take on Apple's iPhone.\nNokia’s Mobile Phone Business (2013-2015) : Microsoft bought Nokia’s handset business for $7.2 billion (plus $1.6 billion for patent licensing) in hopes of boosting its smartphone presence, Microsoft shared in a press release .\nOutcome: The acquisition failed to revive Windows Phone, market share continued to collapse, and Microsoft wrote off nearly the entire purchase and laid off thousands of employees, Medium reported. “It was a mistake to begin with,” said Jack Gold, principal analyst at J. Gold Associates. “A monumental mistake. Microsoft had no business being in the cut-throat, low-margin phone business. Who’s making money in phones besides Apple?\" Jack Gold, principal analyst at J. Gold Associates, told Computerworld.\n\nThe Skype purchase, which cost the company $8.5 billion, is widely considered a misstep relative to Microsoft Teams’ success\nMore Tech Stocks:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\nMicrosoft, you can argue, was just as culpable as Zoom in killing Skype, because it clearly chose Teams as its biggest bet in videoconferencing.\n\"But Microsoft wanted — and still wants — [Teams] to be a Thing People Want To Use, which ultimately led to Skype taking a back seat as its features were gradually cannibalized to improve Teams. In fact, now that Skype has officially been taken out back with a shotgun, Microsoft is actively encouraging users to port their accounts over to Teams ,\" TechRadar's Christian Guyton wrote .\n\nMicrosoft closed Skype in 2025 Microsoft shared a shutdown plan for Skye on its support pages earlier this year.\nAs of May 5, 2025, Skype is retired.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Could Overtake Nvidia as the Largest in the World in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 12:55 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Nvidia's dominance in the computing world is coming into question.\nTech giant Alphabet might start selling a product to rival Nvidia's.\nIts custom TPUs could replace Nvidia's GPUs in some applications.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nNvidia is the world's largest company at about a $4.6 trillion market cap . It has risen to these lofty heights thanks to huge data centers focused on artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia is projected to have another incredible year in 2026, so knocking it off its perch on top of the world will be no small task.\n\nThere are only a few stocks that have a realistic chance to surpass Nvidia, namely Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Microsoft , which are valued at $4.1 trillion, $3.8 trillion, and $3.6 trillion, respectively. Outside of these, there's a significant drop in companies' valuations that would make the gap too big to close in 2026.\nSo, will any of these three topple the leader?\nThere's only one true candidate to overtake Nvidia Of the three, one stands out as a company that probably will not overtake Nvidia: Apple. Although it's the second-largest company in the world, it doesn't have the growth potential to drive it past the leader.\nApple has struggled to post anything above 10% growth for the last three years, and there isn't a catalyst that will suddenly ramp it up in 2026, either. As a result, I think there's almost no chance Apple can pass Nvidia, unless there is an unforeseen event like a halt in data center construction.\n\nThat leaves Alphabet and Microsoft, and of the two, I think Alphabet has the better chance.\nMicrosoft has a great AI strategy of being a facilitator, rather than a pioneer. However, it doesn't have its own generative AI model. Instead, it allows its clients to deploy whichever model they want. While this is smart from a neutrality standpoint, it could become an issue for Microsoft someday because it doesn't control its own destiny.\nThat leaves Alphabet as the lone remaining company that could topple Nvidia as the world's largest in 2026.\nPassing Nvidia will be no easy task Alphabet entered 2025 with several question marks surrounding its core business, its AI prowess, and what the company may look like in the future. And investors received resolutions on all of these issues throughout the year -- all of them positive.\nGoogle Search, thanks to its AI Overviews, maintained its dominance and has firmly established itself as the go-to search engine. Google Gemini has also emerged as one of the top generative AI platforms and is seen as a growing threat to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Lastly, Alphabet received a positive ruling in a court case seeking to break up the business due to monopoly concerns, and it is free to operate mostly as it did before the court case.\n\nStory Continues\nThis allows the market to value Alphabet for the impressive business it is, rather than needing to include caveats for future events.\nIn 2026, the company could gain ground on Nvidia by beating it at its own game. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are reportedly in talks to sell their custom tensor processing units (TPUs), which can replace Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in some applications. If TPUs become widely available and turn into a popular and cheaper alternative to GPUs, Alphabet could have a brand-new growth division while eating into some of Nvidia's market share.\n\nAlphabet also owns about 7% of SpaceX, which could go public sometime in 2026 at a valuation of over $1 trillion. Still, there's no saying that it would sell its stake even if it did go public. The initial public offering could boost Alphabet's stock, but will it be enough to overtake Nvidia? I'd say no.\nUnless an unforeseen event slows data center capital expenditures significantly, Nvidia's projected growth and profitability will continue to make it the largest company in the world. But if its business is disrupted by alternative chip suppliers, such as Alphabet, its market cap may slip, and Alphabet could easily slide in and take its place.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $505,749 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,149,658 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 979 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Warren Buffett’s last day as Berkshire CEO puts focus back on rare asset\n\nAnand Sinha\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 12:22 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nMSFT\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Warren Buffett is finally stepping down as the chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A, BRK-B) after a tenure of 60 years.\nBuffett turned Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textile manufacturer to a global conglomerate. Now, it is the world's 11 th largest company with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion, as per CompaniesMarketCap .\nThe veteran investor, who has been serving as Berkshire CEO since 1965, announced in May that he will exit from the position to make way for the current Vice Chairman, Greg Abel, to take over on Jan. 1, 2026.\nKnown as the \"Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett is considered one of the world's most successful investors ever. With a net worth of $152 billion, he is the world's tenth wealthiest individual, as per Bloomberg .\n\nBuffett inspired a generation of entrepreneurs, such as Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) founder Bill Gates and Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman . His sage advice is paid heed to by nearly every investor, young or old.\n\nRelated: Warren Buffett's Berkshire exits billion-dollar bet ahead of retirement\nBuffett retreats from rare asset class Berkshire Hathaway, under Buffett's leadership, invested in assets belonging to a range of sectors, such as technology and insurance.\nHowever, unlike Wall Street giants like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), it hardly bothered to explore digital assets.\nIn fact, Buffett's dislike of cryptocurrencies is public knowledge. He has, on different occasions, referred to Bitcoin (BTC) as “probably rat poison squared” and a “gambling token.”\n\nHowever, it did once hold stakes in Nubank , a crypto-friendly digital bank based in Brazil.\nAs per Stock Circle , Berkshire acquired more than 107 million shares of Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU)—Nubank's parent firm—in Q4 2021.\nBut the company began divesting its stakes in Nu Holdings in Q3 2024.\nAs reported earlier , Berkshire got completely divested of its stakes in Nu Holdings in Q1 2025, marking a decisive exit from the crypto-related investment.\nThe holding company gained approximately $250 million by divesting its Nu stakes.\nMore News: BlackRock shares 2026 shocking crypto outlook\nWorld's largest bank reportedly chases crypto trading amid debanking claims\nMichael Saylor's Strategy expands dollar reserve instead of Bitcoin\nWhen Buffett convinced an entrepreneur to focus more on stock trading Berkshire's retreat from Nu Holdings is reflective of the broader distrust of digital assets among several established investors like Buffett.\n\nStory Continues\nIn fact, Yoni Assia, founder of the Israeli e-trading firm eToro (Nasdaq: ETOR) that offers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, revealed in May that Buffett had \"actually convinced\" him to focus more on stocks and less on crypto.\nHowever, Assia is a believer in crypto and says \"Nobody doubts that crypto is here to stay.\"\nWhen Saylor called Berkshire '20 th century Bitcoin' Billionaire Michael Saylor has turned his software firm, Strategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), into the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company over the span of the last five years.\nIn May, he wrote an X post and compared Berkshire Hathaway with 20 th century Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor's cryptic comment reflects a novel idea that is believed in by several Bitcoin maximalists.\nThe dominant store of value in the last century was holding a share of a company that manufactures, pays dividends, and employs thousands of people.\nBut the dominant store of value in the 21 st century is a decentralized digital currency like Bitcoin that isn't controlled by a centralized entity like a government or a bank, Bitcoin maximalists believe.\n\nBitcoin in 2025 2025 has been a rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin.\nThe Donald Trump administration brought increased regulatory clarity regarding cryptocurrencies, and several institutional giants like BlackRock dived deeper into digital assets this year.\nBut Wall Street's tight embrace of crypto assets led to complications.\n\nWhen Trump threatened in a social media post on Oct. 10 to hike tariffs on China, it led to panic selling in the crypto market and over $19 billion got wiped out in a day.\nThe crypto market has since been unable to recover and has lost over $1 trillion since the crash. The total crypto market cap stood at $3 trillion at the time of writing.\nNotably, Bitcoin had peaked at a new record price of $126,198.07 on Oct. 7—only a few days before Trump's explosive post. But the crash has the king coin trading 30% lower at $87,408.44 at press time.\nRelated: Berkshire Hathaway saw 93% gain on this crypto investment, its best performer in 2023\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 31, 2025, where it first appeared in the MARKETS section.

      "Content": "The Best Tech Stocks to Buy in January for 2026 Gains\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 11:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMSI\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Microsoft still has considerable momentum across its business.\nMotorola Solutions is on sale following a strategic acquisition.\nADP is a Dividend King that is trading near its 52-week low.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nIt's been a good year for the stock market. The S&P 500 index rose by nearly 18% in 2025 despite a 15% market correction in April. That's a 33% swing from the lows.\n\nInvestors owe much of their good fortune to the technology sector, which continues to carry the broader market as artificial intelligence (AI) drives optimism and investment dollars into chips, data centers, and other AI-related opportunities.\nIt's becoming increasingly difficult to find deep discounts in the tech space, although there are still some deals worth checking out. Here are three top-notch tech stocks investors can buy to start 2026 on a high note.\n1. Microsoft Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) may not be a new or exciting name, but it offers stability and upside in a way that most AI stocks cannot. Its Microsoft Cloud segment, which encompasses established software products such as Windows, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics, among others, provides a strong financial foundation for Microsoft. It also continues to grow; revenue increased by 26% year over year in the company's first quarter of its fiscal year.\n\nMeanwhile, AI demand continues to drive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment, as AI primarily operates through the cloud. The segment's revenue increased by 28% year over year in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, representing an annual run rate of just over $120 billion. Azure's revenue grew by 40%. As it becomes an increasingly larger part of Microsoft, it could start to accelerate the company's total growth rate.\nThat sets the stage nicely for this year. Microsoft stock has performed well this year, rising 15%. Analysts currently estimate next year's earnings per share at $18.75, valuing shares at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26. That's a fair price tag for a company that analysts anticipate will grow earnings at a 16% to 17% annualized rate over the long term. It's rarely a poor decision to buy world-class companies at fair prices.\n\n2. Motorola Solutions No, Motorola Solutions (NYSE: MSI) doesn't sell the name-branded cellphones you may know already. Motorola Solutions spun that business off years ago. The company that remains today specializes in communications equipment and software for law enforcement, schools, government agencies, and corporate clients. Its products include radios, video security systems, body cameras, police drones, and software for command centers.\n\nStory Continues\nEarlier this year, Motorola Solutions acquired Silvus Technologies for $4.4 billion. The company specializes in proprietary communications technology for people and equipment in challenging environments where regular cell or radio networks may not be available. Motorola Solutions has an opportunity to integrate and sell this technology to its broader customer base.\n\nAnalysts estimate the company will grow earnings by 9% annually over the next three to five years. The stock currently trades at 25 times its full-year earnings estimates, a solid discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 32. Motorola Solutions is a rock-solid business worth buying on its current dip and holding into 2026 and beyond.\n3. Automatic Data Processing Business has been good for Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP) for decades. Companies worldwide depend on ADP (as it's better known) for technology tools essential for payroll, compliance, training, and other employee-related functions. Managing human resources is a complex subject for various reasons, and most companies would rather outsource that to a company such as ADP.\n\nADP is a widespread player in the global workforce and economy. As populations grow and businesses flourish, more people having more jobs lay a solid foundation for steady growth. The company has raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years, earning it the title of Dividend King. ADP continues to deliver, with an average dividend increase of 11.5% annually over the past decade.\nThat consistent excellence should continue. Analysts estimate that ADP will continue to grow its earnings by 9% annually over the long term, providing ample growth to power solid dividend raises for the foreseeable future. The stock currently trades near its 52-week low, valuing shares at 23 times full-year earnings estimates. It's a nice buying opportunity for a proven and consistent winner.\n\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "Microsoft Is Lagging the Market—But Its Moat May Matter More in 2026\n\nChris Markoch, MarketBeat\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Microsoft’s entrenched ecosystem and high switching costs make replacing MSFT more expensive than holding, even with a premium valuation.\nAzure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics create a unified platform that reinforces recurring revenue and widens Microsoft’s competitive moat.\nDespite moderating growth expectations, Microsoft’s subscription model and free cash flow strength support a long-term hold case for MSFT stock.\nInterested in Microsoft Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nIt’s not often that investors have heard the words Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and “market laggard” in the same sentence. But that’s the situation with MSFT stock with just a few trading sessions left in 2025. To be clear, Microsoft is up more than 15% in 2025; that’s hardly a poor year. But it is trailing the S&P 500, which is up around 16% for the year.\nThrough its ownership stake in OpenAI, Microsoft has become a leader in generative AI. That’s one reason why some analysts are bullish on MSFT stock heading into 2026.\n→ The Application-Layer Rotation: 3 AI Pure Plays Poised to Win in 2026\nBut is there enough growth to keep investors interested? In the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, Microsoft delivered revenue of $77.67 billion. That was 18% higher year-over-year (YOY). However, the current forecast for Q1 2027 is $88.64 billion in revenue. That's only a 14% YOY increase.\n\nDouble-digit revenue growth isn’t bad. But does it justify holding a stock that has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 34x, which is right around its historical average?\n→ The Lazy Way to Play NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal\nOne way to make that decision is to look at the company’s moat. By several measures, it appears that holding MSFT stock may be easier during the recent downturn.\nThe Cost of Switching: Deep Enterprise Integration Investors may be concerned about flat to slowing revenue growth. However, it’s important to remember that Microsoft is starting from a strong, entrenched user base. For example, over 400 million paid Microsoft 365 seats and 1.6 billion active Windows devices anchor the company in global IT operations.\n\n→ Why NVIDIA’s AI Power-Play Could Drive the Next Major Rally in 2026\nThe embedded nature of these tools makes switching both operationally risky and economically inefficient. Businesses have built entire processes, data systems, and communication norms around Microsoft’s infrastructure. The longer an organization operates within this ecosystem, the more complex its dependencies become.\nAlso, migration costs often exceed the licensing savings of switching to a rival. Beyond software fees, organizations would face retraining costs, productivity loss, and security reconfiguration. Large enterprises rarely deem such disruption justifiable. This stabilizes renewal rates and makes recurring revenue from Microsoft 365 effectively act like an annuity.\n\nStory Continues\nA Unified Platform Creates Ecosystem Dominance Microsoft has refined its platform strategy, connecting productivity software, cloud infrastructure, developer tools, and security under one roof. Azure has become the backbone of digital transformation for countless enterprises, often sitting alongside or fully replacing on-premise data systems.\nBut Microsoft isn’t just for enterprise customers. Its seamless integration with Microsoft 365, Dynamics, and GitHub has turned the company into a one-stop technology provider for businesses of every scale.\n\nThis ecosystem creates a feedback loop. Every new product strengthens the others, curating a digital economy where customers rarely need to look elsewhere. Azure workloads feed into Power Platform analytics, which tie into Teams collaboration and Outlook’s data layer. This cohesion gives Microsoft a commanding advantage across both horizontal (productivity) and vertical (industry-specific) solutions.\nMoreover, the network effect amplifies Microsoft’s dominance. Developers build on Azure because enterprises run on Azure; enterprises adopt Dynamics because their partners already do. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle that has transformed Microsoft from a software vendor into a digital operating system for global business.\nThe 2026 Swing Factor: Can Copilot Turn Into Clear Monetization? Here’s where 2026 feels different from a pure “moat” story. The market already knows Microsoft is embedded. The bigger question is whether Copilot becomes a measurable growth driver at scale.\nIf Copilot expands usage across Microsoft 365 and business apps in a way that’s visible in seat upgrades, higher average revenue per user, or broader deployments inside large accounts, investors will have an easier time defending a mid-30s multiple. If adoption looks slower, the stock can still hold up because of the moat—but the upside may be harder to sustain.\n\nThat’s why MSFT’s 2026 narrative is likely to hinge on evidence that AI is becoming a durable revenue layer, not just a strategic positioning win.\nSubscription-Driven Compounding Provides Recurring Revenue Durability Microsoft’s revenue model has evolved into a high-visibility subscription engine. In fiscal 2025, over 70% of total revenue was derived from recurring (i.e., user-based) sources. Constant seat expansion, higher-tier conversions, and cross-cloud adoption yield mid-teens compound annual growth in commercial cloud revenue, exceeding $160 billion annually, with consistent gross margins near 72%.\n\nThis mix of software margin stability and cloud consumption growth gives Microsoft one of the highest cash conversion rates among large-cap technology stocks. The company’s free cash flow topping $90 billion supports sustained reinvestment into AI infrastructure and customer retention programs without pressuring the bottom line.\nStructural Compounding Microsoft’s moat compounds mathematically. High switching costs protect installed bases; ecosystem breadth expands share of wallet; recurring revenue converts customer loyalty into high-margin cash flows. Together, these dynamics form a self-reinforcing cycle that sustains growth, funds innovation, and steadily increases economic returns, creating one of the most predictable compounding engines in global technology.\nFor investors going into 2026, that’s why MSFT can be easier to hold during drawdowns. The real question is whether the next leg higher is driven by multiple expansion again—or by visible AI monetization that keeps growth closer to the high end of double digits.\nThe article \" Microsoft Is Lagging the Market—But Its Moat May Matter More in 2026 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Ross Gerber Slams Politicians For Pushing Higher Taxes As The 'Solution For Every Issue,' Calls Them The Most 'Incompetent Group' In Society\n\nAdrian Volenik\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nGM\n\nInvestor Ross Gerber is criticizing lawmakers for what he sees as a lazy and ineffective approach to solving the nation's problems: raising taxes.\n“Why do politicians think the solution for every issue is more taxes. Meanwhile they are the most inept, incompetent group in our society,” the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management wrote last week on X . “They have plenty of money to solve every problem in the world and simply can’t execute solutions.”\n\nDon't Miss:\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nCriticism Of Government Spending And Taxation Is Growing Gerber's frustration mirrors a wider skepticism about whether higher taxes actually result in better outcomes. On a May episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” comedian and podcaster Joe Rogan questioned the idea that taxing the rich will help the average person. “Are the poor people going to get that money? No. Are their services going to improve? No, you’re just going to get more government,” he said.\n\nSpeaking with comedian Jimmy Carr , Rogan added that the real issue is waste, not a lack of revenue. “Figure out what to do with the money they already get from everybody,” he said. “And you’re not doing a good job with it. That’s the problem.”\nCarr, who has dealt with his own tax controversy in the UK, added some levity. “It was tax avoidance, not tax evasion,” he said. “There’s a difference, and the difference is about 18 months in prison.”\nTrending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nRogan acknowledged that some high-tax countries, like Norway and Denmark, provide meaningful services in return. But he said that approach doesn't work at scale. “When you scale that to like hundreds of millions of people, things get really weird,” Rogan said.\n\nTaxing the Wealthy Meanwhile, others see taxes on the rich as a moral and economic necessity. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates has repeatedly said that he should be paying more .\n“I am surprised taxes have not been increased more,” Gates said during a 2023 “Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit . “For example, capital gains rates could be the same as ordinary income rates.”\n\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nGates has laid out several proposals to raise taxes on the ultrawealthy, including removing the cap on income subject to Medicare tax, closing the carried-interest loophole, and taxing long-held large fortunes.\n\nStory continues\n“I’ve been disproportionately rewarded for the work I’ve done — while many others who work just as hard struggle to get by,” he wrote in a Gates Notes blog post.\nGates argues that the system now rewards wealth over work and risks creating a dynastic class of inherited privilege, instead of one built on effort and innovation.\n\nWith strong voices on both sides, the debate over how to fund government programs fairly and efficiently is far from settled. What is clear is that the frustration with the current system is growing.\nRead Next: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $2,000 Right Now\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:20 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: SYM\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points A growing number of companies are looking like compelling AI plays.\nMicrosoft offers a more traditional path to invest in the power of AI.\nSymbotic is an AI and robotics business that serves major retailers.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is currently driving a significant infrastructure build-out and productivity gains across nearly every sector from software to healthcare and well beyond. The companies providing the essential hardware and software platforms for AI are the most direct beneficiaries of the current boom. This includes chipmakers and cloud service providers that are seeing massive capital expenditures.\n\nBeyond pure tech, companies across various industries are leveraging AI to innovate their respective businesses. In short, there is an abundance of great companies that offer long-term investors the chance to become part owners of quality businesses and join in on the potential of the AI revolution. If you have $2,000 to invest, here are two no-brainer AI stocks to put some or all of that into right now.\n1. Microsoft The Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure cloud computing platform continues to position itself at the epicenter of the growing demand for high-performance computing (HPC) necessary for AI workloads. The company's early and deep partnership with OpenAI gave it access to cutting-edge AI models which are integrated across its product lines and underscore its front-runner position in enterprise AI.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot utilizes OpenAI 's latest models to automate complex tasks like drafting personalized sales emails, summarize multipage legal contracts, and generate meeting transcripts. Copilot is integrated directly into widely used products like Microsoft 365 (Office, Teams, Outlook), GitHub, and Dynamics 365, thereby leveraging a massive built-in user base for monetization. Over 230,000 organizations have used Copilot Studio to build AI agents. Customers have built over one-million custom agents in total.\nThe use cases for Microsoft's AI tools are virtually endless for large enterprise organizations. For instance, hospitals use Azure OpenAI for personalized diagnostics, such as analyzing MRI scans alongside medical histories to tailor treatments for patients. Organizations deploy sophisticated AI agents that handle routine inquiries, draft knowledge-base articles, and other customer-support solutions. And the list goes on.\n\nThen there's Microsoft Foundry, a unified, end-to-end platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for building, deploying, and managing enterprise-grade AI applications and agents. The platform integrates various AI components, models, and tools under a single layer in Azure, and provides a structured environment to move from prototype to production. Microsoft is moving beyond simple AI assistants to autonomous AI agents that can perform complex business workflows and tasks with minimal human intervention.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's Foundry Models features an extensive catalog of over 11,000 models from Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers. The Foundry Agent Service uses the Microsoft Agent Framework to coordinate single or multiple specialized agents into complex, multistep workflows. Enterprises can use these agents to do things like automate complex financial transactions involving multiple steps or optimize various stages of the retail supply chain like inventory management and logistics coordination.\n\nDemand for AI training and inference is fueling massive capital expenditures for data centers and graphics processing units (GPUs). Azure and other cloud services revenue increased by 40% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company has delivered total revenue of $294 billion and profits of $105 billion over the trailing 12 months alone. If you want to invest in a top AI stock, Microsoft is a no-brainer contender to add to your buy list.\n2. Symbotic Symbotic (NASDAQ: SYM) provides an AI-powered robotic and software platform to modernize and automate warehouses and distribution centers for large retailers and wholesalers. Its technology offers a critical solution to the supply chain industry's challenges. Symbotic's core offering is a modular system that transforms the entire warehouse operation from receiving goods to building optimized, outgoing pallets.\n\nIts fleet of self-driving mobile robots (aptly called Symbots) with advanced computer vision and sensing capabilities move goods throughout warehouses at speeds up to 25 mph. Its system uses a unique storage structure and algorithms to maximize inventory density and slash a warehouse's physical footprint by 30% to 60% compared to traditional operations.\nSymbotic's proprietary AI software orchestrates the entire system, including managing complex robot routing and optimizing tasks in real time to build mixed SKU pallets that are ready for efficient store delivery. The rise of e-commerce has put immense pressure on other retailers to increase efficiency and speed. Symbotic provides the AI-powered solution that allows major companies like Walmart , Target , and Albertsons to keep pace.\n\nThe system's accuracy rate is exceptionally high at 99.9999% for task handling, a level unachievable with manual labor. Symbotic also has a joint venture with SoftBank called GreenBox, which offers a warehouse-as-a-service model to companies that may lack the capital means for a full-system purchase.\nSymbotic's contracted backlog of approximately $22.5 billion provides exceptional revenue visibility for years to come and sets it apart from more speculative growth plays in the AI space. The company is expanding into new verticals, including healthcare, as it sets its sights beyond the retail space.\nWhile Symbotic is not currently profitable, it delivered revenue growth of $2.3 billion (up 26%) in its fiscal year 2025 which ended on Sep. 27. The company ended the fiscal year with a strong cash position of $1.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which increased by $467 million from the prior quarter. Walmart accounted for about 85% of its revenue in the year.\n\nAs the world's largest retailer, Walmart provides a stable, predictable source of revenue for Symbotic. If you're interested in a growth-oriented AI business rather than an established tech leader, Symbotic could be well worth considering.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

On December 18, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Iren with a Neutral rating and $39 price target. The firm sees Iren as a primary beneficiary of the AI infrastructure boom, forecasting a 7x revenue increase by 2028. While the company’s massive deal to provide GPU capacity to Microsoft provides a clear near-term catalyst, Goldman Sachs warned that the stock is already trading at a premium. The firm remains on the sidelines due to a full valuation.\n\nThe centerpiece of Iren’s growth strategy is a landmark $9.7 billion AI cloud contract with Microsoft. Under the five-year agreement, Iren will provide Microsoft with access to 200MW of critical IT load powered by NVIDIA’s latest GB300 GPUs. This single contract is expected to contribute $1.94 billion in annual recurring revenue at an estimated 85% project EBITDA margin. To support this, Iren is accelerating construction of its Horizon 1–4 liquid-cooled data centers at the Childress, Texas site, which are engineered to Tier 3 standards and capable of supporting extreme rack densities of 130kW to 200kW.\nIn FQ1 2026, Iren reported revenue of $240.3 million, which was a massive 355% year-over-year increase compared to the $52.8 million reported in FQ1 2025. This momentum translated into a record net income of $384.6 million, largely supported by unrealized gains on financial instruments.\nIren Limited (NASDAQ:IREN) operates in the vertically integrated data center business in Australia and Canada. The company owns and operates computing hardware, as well as electrical infrastructure and data centers.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of IREN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Every fusion startup that has raised over $100M\n\nTim De Chant\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 12 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nBLK\n\nMSFT\n\nCVX\n\nOver the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.\nThe technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.\n\nThe bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances : more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.\nIt doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.\n\nFounders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers , bringing its total raised near $3 billion.\nCFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels.\n\nSparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape , which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.\nThe Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia , and Google has agreed to buy half its output .\n\nStory Continues\nCFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.\nTAE Technologies Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.\n\nIn December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.\nThe fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.\nHelion Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.\nHelion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.\n\nThe company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.\nPacific Fusion Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses . The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.\n\nThe company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech.\nShine Technologies Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.\n\nThe company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\nGeneral Fusion Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.\n\nIn General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.\nGeneral Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff . CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors.\nIn August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported . Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nTokamak Energy Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs.\n\nThe Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.\nIn total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.\nZap Energy Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.\n\nLike Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.\nProxima Fusion Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.\nProxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.\n\nStellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.\nKyoto Fusioneering With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity.\n\nKyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.\nVenture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.\nMarvel Fusion Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience.\n\nThe inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.\nFirst Light Fusion Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite.\nBut even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022 . Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition.\n\nIn March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue.\nBased in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook.\nXcimer Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.\nFounded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.\nThis story was originally published in September 2024 and will be continually updated.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "NBIS vs. MSFT: Which AI Infrastructure Stock Has More Upside?\n\nShivangi Deora\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) spending continues to accelerate, and investors are increasingly focused on the infrastructure powering this boom. From data centers and GPUs to cloud platforms optimized for AI workloads, the race to supply compute capacity is well underway. In this context, Nebius Group N.V. NBIS and Microsoft Corporation MSFT represent two very different ways to invest in AI infrastructure: one as a fast-growing pure play, the other as a dominant technology giant.\n\nAccording to an IDC report, spending on AI infrastructure is expected to top $758 billion by 2029. This surge in AI-related spending supports both Microsoft and Nebius, but the impact is far from the same. The two companies operate on vastly different scales and follow different growth paths. So, for investors looking to make a smart move in the AI infrastructure space, which stock truly stands out?\nLet’s analyze their fundamentals, growth opportunities, market challenges and valuation to assess which one presents a stronger investment opportunity.\nThe Case for NBIS Nebius operates in a supply-constrained AI infrastructure market, with demand for GPU capacity far exceeding available power and data-center readiness. To take advantage of this imbalance, the company is accelerating the buildout of its platform. It has raised its contracted power target to 2.5 gigawatts by 2026 from its earlier 1-gigawatt goal. By the end of next year, Nebius expects between 800 megawatts and 1 gigawatt of fully connected capacity to be live.\n\nOn the last earnings call, management underscored the strength of demand visibility by highlighting two landmark hyperscale agreements: a five-year, $3 billion contract with Meta and a $17.4–$19.4 billion deal with Microsoft. Also, the company is enhancing its product portfolio through the launch of the Aether 3.0 cloud platform and Nebius Token Factory, an inference solution designed to efficiently run open-source AI models at scale.\nFor 2026, Nebius plans to expand existing data-center footprints in the U.K., Israel and New Jersey, while commissioning new facilities across the United States and Europe in the first half of the year. The company is also in the process of securing multiple large-scale sites, each capable of supporting several hundred megawatts of power, with a number of these locations expected to become operational before the end of 2026. Nebius is targeting $7–$9 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2026 and remains on track to exit 2025 with $900 million to $1.1 billion in ARR.\n\nHowever, the company is facing challenges such as macroeconomic uncertainty, rising operating costs and substantial capital outlays. Third-quarter 2025, sales, general and administrative expenses surged 87% year over year, reflecting the cost burden of rapid expansion. For 2025, Nebius has increased its capital expenditure guidance sharply from $2 billion-$5 billion. Higher capital expenditure levels pose a risk if revenue growth fails to keep pace with the company’s capital intensity, particularly in an environment where AI demand may fluctuate amid competitive pricing pressures and evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nStory Continues\nNebius has tightened full-year revenue guidance to $500–$550 million, expecting results to land near the midpoint due to timing delays in bringing capacity online. While adjusted EBITDA is expected to turn slightly positive at the group level by year-end 2025, it will remain negative for the full year. Moreover, scaling aggressively (multiple data centers in various regions) involves execution risk.\n\nThe Case for MSFT Microsoft has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. The company's substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Microsoft monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nMicrosoft plans to increase total AI capacity by more than 80% this year and nearly double its overall data center footprint over the next two years. The company recently unveiled the Fairwater facility in Wisconsin, which will scale to 2 gigawatts of power on its own, underscoring the sheer magnitude of its infrastructure ambitions. Microsoft has also deployed the world’s first large-scale cluster of NVIDIA GB300 GPUs, positioning Azure at the cutting edge of next-generation AI compute.\nIn December 2025, Microsoft unveiled $23 billion in new AI investments, highlighted by a $17.5 billion commitment in India, its largest investment ever in Asia and an additional $5.4 billion earmarked for Canada over the coming years. These large-scale regional investments underscore Microsoft’s strategic focus on expanding sovereign cloud infrastructure and scaling AI capacity to meet rapidly growing global demand.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%.\nHowever, Microsoft is grappling with intense competition from AWS and Google Cloud, escalating regulatory scrutiny and mounting capital expenditure requirements for AI infrastructure. Long-term debt raises concerns amid rising interest rates, straining financial flexibility. Microsoft expects the fiscal 2026 capital expenditure growth rate to be higher than in fiscal 2025, driven by accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance.\nNBIS & MSFT’s Price Performance NBIS’ shares have plunged 15%, while MSFT stock has inched up 0.1% over the past month.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation for MSFT & NBIS Valuation-wise, Microsoft seems undervalued while Nebius seems overvalued, as suggested by the VGM Score of B and the Value Score of F, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 4.46X, lower than MSFT’s 9.98X.\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for NBIS & MSFT? Analysts have significantly revised their earnings estimates downward for NBIS’ bottom line for the current year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor MSFT, there is a marginal upward revision.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNBIS or MSFT: Which is a Better Pick? NBIS carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present, while MSFT has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Consequently, in terms of Zacks Rank, MSFT seems to be a better pick at the moment.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Be a good person and buy boring stocks: Wall Street reflects on Warren Buffett's wisdom\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 5:40 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nBRK-B\n\nMSFT\n\nKO\n\nTFC\n\nIt's the end of an era.\nToday, Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett, 95, officially hands the reins over to his hand-picked successor Greg Abel.\nThe official passing of the torch concludes Buffett's decades-long investing career, one in which he did everything from buying a major US railroad (Burlington Northern) and striking up a friendship with Microsoft ( MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates to offering up scores of pithy comments in annual shareholder letters.\n“Berkshire’s culture is pretty simple,” Howard Buffett said in a 2024 episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast . “You do what you say you’re going to do and you do it when you say you’re going to do it. You’re honest about it. You make mistakes, and you accept responsibility for those mistakes. It’s really not that complicated.”\n\nHoward is in line to succeed his legendary father as the Berkshire chairman.\nThrough it all, Buffett championed the art of value investing, which is rooted in an unwillingness to overpay for acquisitions or stock investments and was taught to him by mentor Benjamin Graham.\nHe also inspired generations of money managers up and down Wall Street.\nHere's what some of them told Yahoo Finance about the wisdoms they have taken away from the \"Oracle of Omaha.\"\n'Kindness matters' \"Actually, a little known fact is that I managed a $100 million portfolio for Cologne Reinsurance, which was acquired by Buffett at Berkshire,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments. \"And so for a year they kept us on and we managed money for Warren Buffett. I think it was out of the kindness of his heart because we were new. I mean, we generated great returns for the firm. But he has a perspective. And, I would say that kindness matters in this business. There's a lot of people that are not humble. They don't learn from their mistakes. And they're not the kind of people you want to hang out with. He has never engaged in that and he has been steady at the helm.\"",

      "Content": "2 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 4:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nCOST\n\nKey Points These businesses are raking in profits and cash.\nMicrosoft boasts a storied business that's capitalizing on the AI revolution.\nCostco has a resilient membership model that is helping it succeed where some peers are struggling.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nInvesting for the long term is one of the most effective ways to create lasting generational wealth. This is primarily due to the power of compounding returns, which allows investments to grow over multiple decades and across different generations.\nOver short periods, the effect of compounding is minimal, but over decades, that growth can become exponential. If you're looking for two stocks to buy and hold for the long run that can aid in your wealth-building journey, here are two names to consider.\n1. Microsoft Microsoft 's (NASDAQ: MSFT) dominant market position, diversified and high-margin business model, leadership in high-growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, and financial fortitude have made it a great stock to buy and hold for decades. The company is one of just two in the U.S. (the other being Johnson & Johnson ) that boasts the top-tier AAA credit rating, which signifies its exceptional financial strength, robust cash flow , and low default risk.\n\nMicrosoft has a wide range of revenue streams across its productivity software, cloud computing, personal computing, and AI solutions. Many of its products are deeply integrated into the daily operations of businesses and consumers in a way that makes its services mission-critical and imposes high switching costs. Azure is the second-largest cloud provider in the world and a primary growth engine, with its revenue now driven by both traditional cloud migrations and explosive demand for AI workloads.\nThrough its strategic partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft has integrated AI capabilities (like Copilot) across its product suite to enhance its existing offerings and create new monetization opportunities. This first-mover advantage in monetizing generative AI has given Microsoft a significant competitive edge that the company continues to capitalize on.\n\nMicrosoft also benefits from a wide economic moat built on its brand strength, intellectual property, and strong network effects. It's also a cash-generating giant with an excellent balance sheet. The company has raked in $105 billion in profits and $53 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12-month period alone.\nMicrosoft has a proven track record of adapting to changing markets and surviving economic downturns (e.g., the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis). Its strong financial position and diverse business have acted as a buffer against volatility and made it a resilient, long-term holding.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft also has a long history of rewarding investors with a steadily increasing dividend (over 20 consecutive years of increases) and substantial share repurchase programs. While its yield is less than 1%, this is partly due to the high performance of the stock (which has delivered a return upwards of 130% over the trailing five years). If you want a no-brainer stock to buy, hold, and add to again and again through the years as you seek to construct a wealth-building portfolio, Microsoft looks like a great contender to consider.\n\n2. Costco The crux of Costco 's (NASDAQ: COST) success is its membership model, where its recurring annual fees account for the vast majority of its operating profit. These fees provide a highly predictable and high-margin revenue stream that's largely insulated from typical retail sales volatility and economic downturns.\n\nIn fact, Costco maintains impressive membership renewal rates that regularly exceed 90% in the U.S. and Canada. This loyalty is driven by the company's commitment to offering high-quality products at extremely low prices, which incentivizes members to shop frequently and ensures a stable customer base.\nBy selling a limited selection of products in bulk and operating a highly efficient supply chain (e.g., using warehouse stores for both retail and storage), Costco achieves massive economies of scale and significant negotiating leverage over suppliers.\nThe savings are passed to the customer. The ability to buy a wide range of items in bulk at lower prices than are available at other retailers is a sticky value proposition in all economic environments.\n\nThe company has a history of strong cash flow generation, low debt, and a healthy balance sheet. It has increased its regular quarterly dividend for over 20 consecutive years and occasionally pays large special dividends to reward long-term shareholders.\nCostco looks like a great stock to buy for investors who want to gain exposure to the retail space by investing in a profitable, resilient business. Its total return of 150% over the last five years and its consistent dividend history more than compensate for its lower yield of less than 1%.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

But I think the the the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So, you know, a lot of people should be actually reallocating now. Maybe not today, you know, on a few of the last trading days in the uh in the sessions here, but, you know, from a tax consequence standpoint. But I think, you know, you have an opportunity in the forward, you know, months coming forward here in 2024, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think I think the the point is is that you should. Don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n00:54 Speaker A\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n00:58 Speaker B\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, one out of every 10 years that you know, they've outperformed and we get seven out of 10 on the uh broader markets of out performance. So I like to stay US. So, you know, my thought is is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2024, but, you know, the dollar may, you know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cost average in, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just uh hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on the year ahead too.\nPowered by the artificial intelligence trade once again, the 2025 financial markets story might seem, on the surface, to be a rerun of what investors lived through in 2023 and 2024.\n\nShine a bit of light on the subject, however, and we see the inner workings of the market's path in 2025 spun an eventful story that won't soon be forgotten.\nDonald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president.\nThe largest company in the world lost nearly 20% of its value in a single day.\nThe S&P 500 registered its worst week since the COVID crash of 2020, crashing 10% in just two days.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%.\nGold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year in two generations. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory Continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

      "Content": "These Stocks Are the Market’s Biggest Winners and Losers in 2025\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nUpdated Wed, December 31, 2025 at 3:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nLULU\n\nTSLA\n\nCOIN\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index is poised to end 2025 up more than 17% as the bull market continues for a third year driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.\nThe AI trade broadened out this year, as chip stocks again led the S&P 500 but were joined by the shares of companies tied to building the data centers that will power the technology. Three of the index’s top 10 performers in 2025 were data storage companies, which are among the main beneficiaries of the hundreds of billions of dollars in pledged spending by the giant AI cloud service providers known as hyperscalers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nOn the flip side, economic uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs weighed on the shares of consumer companies, while health-care stocks struggled with uncertainty surrounding the administration’s policies and pressure on drug prices.\nHere are some of the biggest winners and losers in the US stock market this year.\n\nWinner: New AI Leadership Technology stocks, especially those tied to AI, again dominated the market. But leadership shifted to the shares of companies associated with data — from storage to the building, heating and cooling of data centers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ) Corp., Amazon.com ( AMZN ) Inc., Alphabet ( GOOG ) Inc. and Meta Platforms ( META ) Inc. have pledged to spend more than $440 billion over the next 12 months to build out AI capabilities, benefiting firms such as Sandisk ( SNDK ) Corp., Western Digital ( WDC ) Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc ( STX ), which were three of the four best performing stocks in the S&P 500.\nWinner: New S&P 500 Additions A slew of companies were added to the S&P 500 in 2025, including Robinhood ( HOOD ) Markets Inc., Sandisk, AppLovin ( APP ) Corp. and Carvana ( CVNA ) Co., all of which posted triple-digit percentage gains and landed among the top 20 performers in the index.\nOf course, not every stock that joined the S&P 500 got a boost. Trade Desk ( TTD ) Inc. shares were the worst performers in the index with a nearly 70% loss, while Block ( XYZ ) Inc. tumbled more than 20% and Coinbase ( COIN ) Global Inc. sank more than 6%.\n\nWinner: Palantir Palantir ( PLTR ) Technologies Inc. shares are set to notch a triple-digit gain for the third year in a row. The software developer got a boost from AI enthusiasm and strong buy-in from retail traders who are drawn to the company’s outspoken Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp.\n\nBut the stock is now rather pricey. With a multiple of more than 180 times forward earnings, it’s the third most expensive member of the S&P 500 behind Tesla Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWinner: Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ) soared almost 175% in 2025 on the strength of takeover speculation. The company formally put itself up for sale in October, and there’s an ongoing battle between the top two bidders, Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) Corp. and Netflix ( NFLX ) Inc., with both suitors jockeying to strengthen financial backing for their offers.\nThe Warner Bros. board prefers the Netflix bid and is reportedly planning to reject Paramount’s offer, but Larry Ellison, the billionaire chairman of Oracle Corp. and father of Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison, is personally guaranteeing the Paramount proposal.\nLoser: Consumer Staples Economic uncertainty, tariffs and concerns about the health of the US consumer as inflation creeps higher weighed on consumer stocks, especially some major staples names. Clorox ( CLX ) Co., frozen french fries maker Lamb Weston ( LW ) Holdings Inc., Campbell’s ( CPB ) Co. and beverage giant Constellation Brands ( STZ ) Inc. were among the 20 worst-performers in the S&P 500. Shares of fast-casual dining brand Chipotle ( CMG ) Mexican Grill Inc. sank nearly 40% after two years of double-digit gains.\n\nLoser: Retail The same economic uncertainty also hit shares of some retail companies. Deckers ( DECK ) Outdoor Corp., which owns brands such as Hoka and Ugg, was down almost 50% in 2025, snapping a nine-year streak of gains. The stock was hit hard by a few weak earnings forecasts and analyst downgrades.\nLululemon ( LULU ) Athletica Inc. shares are set to fall nearly 45% this year, their second consecutive double-digit annual decline, as the athletic apparel retailer struggles through an overhaul after a period of slow growth and the recent exit of its chief executive officer. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in the company.\n\nLoser: Managed Care Health insurance stocks underperformed in 2025 despite hopes that the group would benefit from a shift in policy by the Trump administration. Molina ( MOH ) Healthcare Inc. shares were down more than 40%, their second straight year of double-digit declines. UnitedHealth ( UNH ) Group Inc. and Centene ( CNC ) Corp. have both shed more than 30%, putting them among the 25 worst performers in the S&P 500.\nStill, there are signs of hope for the group as some investors view the beaten-down valuations as attractive, making the stocks possibly due for a rebond. Money manager Michael Burry has said he’s long Molina shares and that he views the company as acquisition target in 2026 if it remains this cheap.\n\n—With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has More Than 10% of His Holdings in 1 AI Stock Well Positioned for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKey Points Microsoft has had a successful AI strategy so far.\nMicrosoft's stock carries a premium valuation, but for a good reason.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nFollowing billionaires and seeing what stocks they hold can be a great gut check for investors. This is made possible due to a Securities and Exchange Commission requirement that all money managers with greater than $100 million in assets report their end-of-quarter holdings. This information is then made available to the public 45 days after the quarter ends through a Form 13F . So the latest information we have on billionaire holdings is from Sept. 30, 2025.\n\nThe key is to find fund managers who aren't actively trading the market but are instead long-term investors. One of those is billionaire Chase Coleman, who runs Tiger Global Management. In Q3, he made zero trades in four of his five largest holdings, so he's clearly not trading in and out of the market. He also holds a significant chunk of his portfolio, 10.5% to be exact, in one artificial intelligence (AI) stock that has been a long-term winner: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) .\nMicrosoft is a common holding among billionaires, and it's Coleman's largest investment. So is it a smart buy for you? Let's take a look.\nMicrosoft's business model is thriving in today's AI-driven world First, let's take a look to see if Microsoft's stock has moved significantly since Sept. 30.\nMSFT data by YCharts\nMicrosoft's stock is actually down since we last knew Coleman owned its stock. Because Coleman is a long-term investor, it's unlikely that anything has emerged in the Microsoft investment thesis that would have changed his mind about keeping Microsoft's stock as a large chunk of his portfolio.\n\nThis can give investors confidence that Microsoft could be a great buy now.\nThe Microsoft investment thesis pivots around its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. Microsoft has chosen not to develop its own generative AI model. Instead, it's serving as a facilitator and enabling AI creators to use whichever model suits their needs most. Azure Foundry offers models from OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and many others. This makes Microsoft's cloud computing platform one of the most popular to build on, which shows up in its financial results.\nDuring Microsoft's Q1 FY 2026 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), Azure grew its revenue 40%, making it the fastest-growing cloud computing business of the major providers. If Azure continues to be the most popular option in this space, I'd expect the stock to continue to outperform.\n\nStory Continues\nAnother growth area for Microsoft is its Copilot product. Copilot integrates generative AI into Microsoft's core Office software, and it has done a great job of upselling existing clients on these capabilities. This improvement allowed Microsoft 365 commercial and consumer segments to rise by 17% and 26%, respectively, during Q1. However, there are some questions surrounding the usefulness of these products. While some users have certainly found value, there are many who haven't. This could cause some businesses to downgrade their licenses, causing a headwind for Microsoft in the future.\n\nMicrosoft's success hinges on how well its AI products are received. Currently, there is a near-universal positive reception regarding its strategy, but if that shifts, Microsoft's stock could be in for some pain.\nMicrosoft's stock isn't cheap Even though Microsoft's stock has pulled back from where it ended Q3, it still maintains an expensive premium. It trades for 30 times forward earnings, which isn't cheap.\nMSFT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nIt's also quite average for the big tech companies, and as long as Microsoft continues to post quarters with midteens revenue growth, I think this valuation is reasonable. However, if it slows down to a market-average pace, the stock could struggle in 2026.\n\nWall Street analysts project 16% revenue growth for FY 2026 (ending June 30), and 15% for FY 2027. If that pans out, I have no doubt that Microsoft will be a market-beating stock, justifying Coleman's investment. But if growth starts to slow for any reason, Microsoft's stock could lose to the market. I think Microsoft's future will look pretty similar to its past, making it a solid stock pick over the next few years. Just don't expect it to deliver jaw-dropping returns.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

No,\" he added.\nThat's not entirely true, as there are some successful ad-driven content companies (like the one that published this article, The Arena Group), but making money in content with an ad-driven site, even one supported with e-commerce, has proven to be very challenging.\nNow, another popular content and commerce brand, Food52, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .\nFood52 has been struggling One brand feeling the pressure of digital monetization is Food52, which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nFood52 had a major layoff back in March.\nWorkforce reduced by 40% (from 140 to 90 employees).\nRevenue target of $60M in 2025, but unprofitable.\nExploring a sale to one or multiple acquirers.\nSource: I Alternative Media reported.\n\nThese layoffs and revenue struggles show just how difficult it is for even well-known content brands to survive online.\nThe company has been pursuing a sale since Nov.\n\"The food media publisher Food52 is exploring a sale, according to an internal email viewed by ADWEEK. The memo, which was sent by chief executive Erika Ayers Badan, marks the clearest sign yet that the food and lifestyle publisher’s years-long turnaround effort may give way to new ownership,\" ADWEEK reported .\n\nStory Continues\nNo sale price has been specified, though Badan wrote in her email that Food52 is in the “early stages” of exploring a sale and may sell to one or multiple acquirers.\nMore Bankruptcy:\nKey auto parts and services company files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nKey travel brand files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nSelf-driving-car company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\n35-year-old consumer company files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nThe company, which includes the Food52 publisher, the manufacturing firm Schoolhouse, and design brand Dansk, hoped to generate $60 million in revenue this year, although it was unprofitable, according to previous ADWEEK reporting .\nNow, the company will no longer have full control of that process as it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nMaking money in content is very hard Having been a digital editor since the late 90s, when I once worked at a company that spent over $100,000 fulfilling a $50,000 ad contract with a major car brand, I have had a front row seat to the challenges facing online content creators.\nThe challenge, and it's very hard to do this with specialized, but not overly differentiated content like recipes, is to get enough eyeballs that advertising pays for your content and then some.\n\nThat's hard to do with recipes and cooking tips where the difference between lousy content generated by AI can still give you a serviceable recipe for chicken parmesan.\nI have spent decades working on the problem of producing human, not artificial intelligence, content that drives enough viewers to make money. That's a puzzle that, on most days, I have solved, but it's a challenge very few editors and publications have beaten,\nDigital advertising continues to grow as a proportion of total advertising revenue, a trend driven in large part by growth in advertising on mobile devices.\n\"In 2022, according to eMarketer estimates, digital advertising grew to $245 billion , an increase from $221 billion in 2021 and $161 billion in 2020 .

It shifted focus toward e-commerce and commerce brands (like Schoolhouse and Dansk) while de‑emphasizing its original content/community model, Adweek reported.\nBusiness continues: Under typical Chapter 11 practice, the company generally remains open and operating, now as a “debtor in possession,” according to the United States Courts .\nDebt restructuring: Food52 will propose a reorganization plan to restructure obligations to creditors, possibly selling assets or brands as part of that plan, according to its filings on PacerMonitor .\nRelated: After denials, 158-year-old retailer mulls Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 30, 2025, where it first appeared in the Retail section.

      "Content": "An AI super-bull who just backed the Nvidia-Groq deal warns of a data center bust: ‘We foresee a significant financial crisis’\n\nEva Roytburg\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 11:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nEQIX\n\nMSFT\n\nCIFR\n\nOne of the most aggressive backers of the AI boom—whose firm most recently facilitated Nvidia’s largest deal ever —has issued a warning to the rest of the market: The “build it and they will come” approach to data centers is a dangerous gamble.\nAlex Davis, chief executive of Austin-based investment firm Disruptive, wrote in a letter to investors he expects a “significant financing crisis” to hit the speculative data-center market as soon as 2027 or 2028, driven by extreme capital expenditure and a growing mismatch between who is constructing AI infrastructure and who will ultimately use it.\n\n“We are seeing way too many business models (and valuation levels) with no realistic margin expansion story, extreme capex spend, lack of enterprise customer traction, or overdependence on “roundtrip” investments – in some cases all with the same company,” Davis wrote.\nDavis’ warning was first reported by Axios .\nThe warning comes just days after Nvidia agreed to license assets from Groq, a high-performance AI chipmaking startup Disruptive has backed since its founding (not to be confused with Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot). The transaction, which Davis has said is valued at roughly $20 billion in cash, represents the largest deal Nvidia has ever completed and underscores how aggressively the company is moving to lock up all the verticals in AI talent and intellectual property.\n\nYet, Davis argues the same exuberance driving landmark transactions at the chip level is also fueling excess elsewhere in the AI stack, particularly among third-party data-center developers betting on what he called the “build it and they will come” model.\n“If you’re a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers,” Davis wrote in the letter. “We want to back the owner-users, not the speculative landlords.”\nThe risk, as the venture capitalist sees it, is not that demand for AI compute disappears, but rather that capital has rushed into the wrong hands. While hyperscalers and well-capitalized tech companies can absorb massive upfront costs, speculative landlords rely on short-term financing and customers that may never materialize at scale.\nDavis didn’t name names in his letter, but if you follow his distinction about “speculative landlords” versus “owner/users” like Microsoft and Meta that will eventually build their own facilities, the most obvious targets could be the legacy wholesale giants like Digital Realty and Equinix .\n\nStructured as something called “real estate investment trusts,” these companies generate returns by developing and leasing capacity to the same tech giants Davis predicts will soon cut out to capture margins themselves. If that shift accelerates, it could leave landlords facing refinancing pressure just as a wave of debt comes due, even if overall demand for AI compute continues to rise. That imbalance, he warned, could place significant stress on private credit markets and ripple outward if financing conditions tighten.\n\nStory Continues\nDigital Realty and Equinix did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nDavis’ argument echoes warnings made on the other side of the aisle, including the thesis of famed short-seller Jim Chanos , who explicitly bets against “neoclouds” and converted crypto-miners like Cipher Mining. Chanos has argued that data center hosting is becoming a “commodity business,” warning clients that “the magic and the money is going to come from what the chips produce ultimately, not where they reside.” Both investors seem to agree that while the AI technology itself is valuable, the third-party landlords rushing to house it are walking into a trap.\n\nYet the caution is startling coming from Davis, who said in the letter that he remains deeply bullish on AI itself. Disruptive has deployed billions of dollars across private technology companies it views as core to the AI economy, including Groq, open-source model developers, and defense-oriented software firms. Davis describes the current wave of AI innovation as a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.\n“While I continue to believe the ongoing advancements in AI technology present ‘once in a lifetime’ investment opportunities, I also continue to see risks and reason for caution and investment discipline,” he wrote.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Dear Marvell Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 7\n\nLarry Ramer\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: HSBC\n\nThe shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) sank about 14% between Dec. 3 and Dec. 26, at least partly due to concerns about market -share losses raised by investor bank Benchmark, along with HSBC and Barclays, two UK-based banks. However, Citi recently called these worries “misguided” and contended that the stock’s recent weakness has created “a buying opportunity.” The U.S.-based bank indicated that information which will be revealed at the upcoming CES conference will dispel the fears triggered by Benchmark and HSBC. CES will take place between Jan. 6 and Jan. 9.\n\nMeanwhile, another U.S. bank, JPMorgan, also disputed the assertions by Benchmark and HSBC, while Marvell’s recently issued 2026 guidance indicates that the fears about MRVL stock are overdone. Among the other factors that should help Marvell over the longer term are the large size of its total addressable market and its relatively low valuation. In light of all of these points, some risk-tolerant, medium- to long-term investors should consider buying MRVL stock now.\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

Subscribe today!\n\nAbout MRVL Stock Marvell markets semiconductor systems used by data centers and to facilitate edge networking. Among its leading products are system-on-a-chip architectures and ethernet offerings.\nIn the company’s third quarter that ended on Nov. 1, its sales came in at $2.07 billion, up from $1.5 billion during the same period a year earlier. Additionally, the firm’s operating income rose to $357.8 million last quarter, versus an operating loss of $703 million in Q3 of the previous fiscal year.\nAnalysts on average expect Marvell’s earnings per share to surge 30.5% to $2.87 during its upcoming fiscal 2027 that ends in January 2027. The forward price-earnings ratio of MRVL stock is 39.3 times while its price-book ratio is 5.2 times.\nThe Contentions of Benchmark, HSBC, and Barclays On Dec. 8, Benchmark lowered its rating on MRVL to “Hold” from “Buy” and stopped providing a price target on the name. Benchmark analyst Cody Acree, who made the call after speaking with sources in Silicon Valley, reported that he believes with a “high degree of conviction” that Amazon (AMZN) will not use Marvell’s XPUs for its Trainium 3 and Trainium 4 AI chips which are due to be released in the future. Amazon has been the largest purchaser of Marvell’s XPUs in the past. There has also been speculation that Microsoft (MSFT) could reduce its utilization of Marvell’s XPUs going forward.\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, HSBC at the end of November contended that Marvell’s share of revenue from Amazon’s upcoming chips would drop compared with its past offerings. The UK-based bank has a “Hold” rating on MRVL\nAnd finally, Barclays in October predicted that Marvell’s share of the 1.6T optics market would decline.\n\nThe Evidence Against the Banks’ Bearish Views In a Dec. 23 note, Citi analyst Atif Malik, after meeting with two Marvell executives, wrote that fears about the company’s XPU business and its “opportunity at 1.6T are misguided.” Moreover, Malik called the stock’s “post-earnings weakness …. a buying opportunity,” and he believes that technology which Marvell will introduce at CES could help it convince Amazon to incorporate its offerings in AMZN’s Trainium 4 chip. He has a “Buy” rating on MRVL.\n\nSimilarly, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur, after meeting with Marvell’s COO, wrote that the firm said that it had obtained “purchase orders for all of ”2026 for Amazon's Trainum 3 chips.” As far as MSFT is concerned, Marvell asserted that its business with the tech giant “remains on track to ramp [in the] back-half of calendar year 2026 and into calendar year 2027,” Sur reported, adding that MRVL is “already working on next-gen… XPU programs for both customers.” Sur, who believes that Marvell’s business with both MSFT and AMZN is still “solidly intact,” has a $130 price target and an “Overweight” rating on MRVL stock.\nAlso importantly, Marvell‘s guidance for its Data Center segment, which was issued on Dec. 2 and includes its XPU business, calls for the unit’s revenue to surge by 25% in fiscal 2027 and by 40% in fiscal 2028.\n\nThe Bottom Line on MRVL Stock It seems likely, although not certain, that the combination of JPMorgan, Citi, and Marvell’s upbeat guidance is far more reliable than the negative reports by Benchmark, HSBC and Barclays. In my experience, major companies rarely lie about the state of their businesses, and they usually are fairly honest about how their business looks two years or less into the future. Consequently, I think that the upbeat reports by JPMorgan and Citi, which are based on Marvell’s own statements, are rather reliable. Further, Marvell’s guidance, which appears to be rather upbeat, is also likely based on genuine data points.\n\nConversely, the negative reports by Benchmark HSBC and Barclays appear to be based largely on anonymous sources that may not be entirely reliable.\nTherefore, I believe that Marvell probably has not lost a significant amount of business from Amazon or Microsoft.\nFurther, the total addressable market of Marvell’s AI data center business is a huge $85 billion, according to Oppenheimer. Also noteworthy is that, despite Marvell’s strong growth outlook, its price-book ratio is below the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) average level of 5.6 times, while its forward price-earnings ratio of 39.3 times is not very far above the S&P 500 average of 31.3 times.\nIn light of all of these points, I believe that risk-tolerant, medium- to long-term investors looking for increased exposure to the AI chip market should indeed consider buying MRVL on weakness.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer had a position in: AMZU, AMZN.

The Oracle of Omaha was also noted to have invented the Buffett Indicator, which assesses the valuation of the stock market by dividing the total value of US stocks with the total US GDP (gross domestic product).\n\nYahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma weighs in on how much longer the Buffett Indicator may be calling for a continued bull market, while Miramar Capital Co-Founder and senior portfolio manager Max Wasserman comments on his outlook on the AI trade when factoring in Warren Buffett's market formula.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian\nI have this story on this Buffett indicator now in Yahoo Finance and I was chuckling a little bit as I put it together because that it has been overvalued for years, uh especially the past two years and I I came away thinking this indicator, we're showing there on the screen what it's all about this Buffett indicator, could stay overvalued for more years.\n00:22 Speaker B\nBrian, we had a guest on a stocks and translation yesterday, the podcast of Yahoo Finance. And when we spoke to this guest, she was largely saying that if you take a look just at valuation over the past three years and you didn't choose to jump into the market, then you would have missed out on this three-year bull run. Many expecting that next year could be the fourth year of this bull market that we've seen so far. And so while yes, the Buffett indicator is overvalued, many are saying that this market, the valuations are too high. If you missed out over the past three years, then you missed out on this three-year run and what could be another fourth year of the bull market that we've seen. And also we're hearing so much uh from different uh outlooks for 2026 about where exactly the S&P 500, even as high as 8100 is one-year end target for 2026. And so more momentum is expected to come. And so yes, there are high valuations right now, but what we've seen over the past few few years is really these continued momentum proving that overvaluation saga wrong.\n01:21 Brian\nMax, I love this on the notes that uh you sent over to us. You said you were very cautious on the Open AI trade. And I thought, well, does that mean investors should be betting against AI stocks at this point?\n01:40 Max\nWell, I don't look at investing as betting, but I think they have to be aware of where they're going to get the returns. So, yes, I'm very cautious. We have investments in Open AI. I'm just not not in Open AI, but we have it in the Googles, the Microsofts and all this. but I would be cautious on the financing aspect of Open AI, the circular financing and given the concentration, you need to diversify the portfolio and you need to understand what you own and what happens if you're wrong. So if this trade goes south, it's going to take the indices with it. I don't think the general market again is as expensive as this concentrated part of the market. But yes, I think there's risk there and I don't think you're going to get these double triple digit returns like you have, and I think you have to go to other parts of the market. And going back to the Buffett indicator, keep in mind, that's just an indicator. He was still he's an investor in stocks, and he's telling you to really know what you're buying and don't overpay for it. That's really what he was saying by that indicator.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 ESG Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio for Sustainable Returns in 2026\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 9:48 AM PST 5 min read\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing essentially refers to the evaluation of an enterprise not only in terms of financial performance but also related to its impact on broader stakeholders, including the environment and society. The environmental factors evaluate how a company is doing in managing carbon emissions, pollution, waste, water usage and energy efficiency. The social approach examines treatment of employees, including workplace safety and diversity, as well as management of relationships with customers and suppliers. Governance assesses the quality of leadership, board independence, ethical conduct, compliance, transparency and the effectiveness of internal control.\n\nESG is gaining importance due to rising awareness about environmental damage and social rights. Enterprises have been compelled to take up responsible practices as asset managers and institutions incorporate ESG into portfolio strategies. Tightened regulation aimed at curbing greenwashing, which refers to misleading publicity related to ESG policies, has boosted investor confidence. Evidently, companies with high ESG focus are better at handling regulatory, environmental, and social risks, making them desirable stocks for investors over the long term. NVIDIA NVDA, IDEXX Laboratories IDXX and Microsoft MSFT are three stocks that should be on investors’ radar for ESG investing in 2026.\n\nPrice Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n3 Stocks for Sustainable Returns NVIDIA achieved 100% renewable electricity for all its global offices and controlled data centers in fiscal 2025.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA’s GPUs power eight of the top 10 most energy-efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the November 2024 Green500 list. NVIDIA’s GPU-accelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for a number of workloads, as it is optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs are generally more than 50 times more energy efficient than traditional CPUs for large language model AI inference workloads. NVIDIA’s DPUs consumes 30% less power as they offload essential data center networking and infrastructure functions from less-efficient CPUs.\n\nIn terms of employee diversity, at the end of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA’s global workforce comprised 78% male and 21% female, with 6% of NVDA’s workforce in the United States comprising Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\n\nNVIDIA shares have appreciated 36.9% in the trailing 12-month period.

The company plans to replenish more water than it consumes in direct operations. The company has invested $25 million in WaterEquity’s Water & Climate Resilience Fund through the Climate Innovation Fund (CIF). MSFT’s zero waste goal transcends into the elimination of operational waste going to landfill or incineration (diverted approximately 26,000 metric tons of waste across its owned datacenters and campuses). In fiscal 2024, Microsoft diverted 88.1% of operational waste and reused or recycled 90.9% of servers and components.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is leveraging AI for Good Lab and tools like the Microsoft Planetary Computer to drive biodiversity conservation. For carbon-free electricity (CFE), Microsoft has contracted 19 GW of new renewable energy across 16 countries through power purchase agreements (PPAs), pivotal to its carbon reduction strategy. Through CIF, Microsoft has invested more than $793 million in capital in new climate technologies, expanding to 63 investments across CFE, sustainable fuels, carbon removal, and advanced building materials.\n\nMicrosoft shares have returned 14.7% in a year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 increased a couple of cents to $15.61 per share, indicating 14.4% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2025.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Can CoreWeave Maintain More Than 60% EBITDA Margins Amid Rising CapEx?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:04 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CRWV\n\nCoreWeave, Inc .’s CRWV third-quarter 2025 results reinforced its position as one of the most profitable and fastest-growing AI-focused cloud infrastructure providers. CoreWeave’s adjusted EBITDA was $838.1 million in the third quarter compared with $378.8 million in the prior-year quarter. EBITDA margins exceeded 60%, reflecting strong operating leverage, disciplined cost management and highly contracted revenue streams.\n\nManagement emphasized that margin performance continues to benefit from long-term customer agreements, high utilization rates and an infrastructure model optimized specifically for AI workloads rather than general-purpose cloud computing. This specialization allows CoreWeave to extract higher returns per deployed GPU compared with traditional hyperscalers.\nCapital expenditures remain elevated as CoreWeave accelerates investments in data centers, power infrastructure and next-generation GPUs. Management characterized this spending as demand-driven rather than speculative, noting that a substantial portion of new capacity is backed by pre-committed contracts.\nWhile near-term margins may fluctuate modestly due to the timing of capacity expansions, management underscored that incremental deployments remain margin-accretive once assets are fully operational. CoreWeave’s backlog and remaining performance obligations provide strong visibility into future revenue and profitability, reducing the risk typically associated with large-scale infrastructure buildouts.\n\nApart from this, CoreWeave continues to benefit from multiple growth tailwinds. Demand from AI labs, enterprise customers and hyperscale partners remains robust, driven by ongoing shortages of high-performance compute capacity. The company has close ecosystem relationships, including access to advanced GPU platforms. Also, CoreWeave has secured major multi-year agreements, including up to $14.2 billion with Meta, expanded its OpenAI partnership to around $22.4 billion and won a sixth contract with a leading hyperscaler. These deals highlight its transformation from a niche GPU cloud provider into a global AI infrastructure leader, powered by purpose-built HPC networking and large-scale parallel compute.\nFor 2025, Capex is estimated to be $12 billion to $14 billion compared with $20 billion to $23 billion projected earlier. The company expects 2026 capital expenditures to be more than double the level seen in 2025. While rising capital expenditures introduce execution risk, CoreWeave’s third-quarter performance and forward guidance suggest that its margin profile remains resilient. With strong demand visibility, a highly specialized infrastructure model and disciplined capital allocation, CoreWeave appears well-positioned to maintain EBITDA margins above 60% even as it scales aggressively to support the next phase of AI-driven growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTaking a Look at CRWV’s Competitors Nebius Group N.V. NBIS is another hypergrowth AI infrastructure-focused company. It recently announced a new agreement with Meta to deliver AI infrastructure valued at approximately $3 billion over the next five years. The company’s mega-deals with Microsoft and Meta are expected to begin contributing late in the quarter, with the majority of related revenue ramping up throughout 2026. For 2025, Nebius has tightened its full-year group revenue outlook to a range of $500 million to $550 million from the previous guidance of $450 million to $630 million. It has raised its capital expenditure guidance from approximately $2 billion to around $5 billion. Although the company expects adjusted EBITDA to turn slightly positive at the group level by year-end 2025, it will remain negative for the full year.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation MSFT is gaining from its AI strength. Microsoft recently announced plans to increase total AI capacity by more than 80% in 2025 and roughly double the total data center footprint over the next two years. The company unveiled Fairwater in Wisconsin as the world's most powerful AI data center, which will scale to two gigawatts and go online next year. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, the company’s capital expenditures totaled $34.9 billion, with roughly half allocated to short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand and first-party applications. Microsoft expects the fiscal 2026 capital expenditure growth rate to be higher than fiscal 2025, driven by accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance.\n\nCRWV Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of CoreWeave have gained 88% in the past year compared with the Internet Software industry’s growth of 9.6%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn terms of Price/Book, CRWV’s shares are trading at 9.44X, way higher than the Internet Software Services industry’s 6.07X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRWV’s earnings for 2025 has been revised north over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Warren Buffett is retiring — here's what his favorite indicator reveals about the stock market\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nIt's time for one final check in with the investing GOAT's favorite stock market indicator before he rides off into the sunset.\nBerkshire Hathaway ( BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett , 95, will hand over the reins to his hand-picked successor Greg Abel on Wednesday.\nThe official passing of the torch caps a storied career for Buffett, which included buying a major US railroad (Burlington Northern), striking up a friendship with Microsoft ( MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates, and offering up scores of pithy comments in annual shareholder letters.\n\n“Berkshire’s culture is pretty simple,” Howard Buffett told me in a 2024 episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (listen below). “You do what you say you’re going to do, and you do it when you say you’re going to do it. You’re honest about it. You make mistakes and you accept responsibility for those mistakes.”\nHoward is in line to succeed his father as Berkshire chairman.\n\nThrough it all, Buffett championed the art of value investing, as taught to him by mentor Benjamin Graham. The philosophy is rooted in an unwillingness to overpay for investments.\nThe \"Buffett Indicator\" takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual US GDP. It rose to fame following a 2001 Fortune Magazine article written by Buffett and longtime Fortune writer and Buffett insider Carol Loomis.\n\n\"The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know,\" Buffett explained in the article. \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"\nThe indicator is at valuation levels never seen before, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. It suggests that stocks are long overdue for a healthy pullback in early 2026.\nPicking apart the numbers, the Buffett Indicator stands at about 221.4% — up a sharp 22% from April 30, per data from GuruFocus. The indicator has never been at a higher level dating back to the earliest data from GuruFocus in 1970.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) has shot up nearly 17% on the year amid major optimism surrounding the earnings potential of AI-related companies and the effect the technology will have on profits. Analysts in turn have scrambled to upwardly revise their profit forecasts on companies, supporting higher stock prices.\nFor his part, Buffett has bet on the AI future by maintaining stock investments in Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and more recently, Alphabet ( GOOGL ).\nWherever the stock market goes from here, one thing can't be questioned: Buffett's impact on investing.\n\nStory Continues\n\"I think Warren Buffett's the GOAT of capitalism,\" Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me on Opening Bid (video above) in October. \"There's so much guidance and wisdom that we've had from Warren over the years.\"\nBerkshire purchased Brooks in 2006. Each year at the storied Berkshire annual shareholder meeting, Brooks makes special edition sneakers with the face of Buffett as well as his longtime business partner Charlie Munger .\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nTuttle Capital Management Launches the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\n\nNewsfile\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:02 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CBOE\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGreenwich, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - December 30, 2025) - Tuttle Capital Management, a leading provider of thematic and alternatives ETFs, today announced the launch of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (CBOE: MAGO) , now trading on the CBOE.\nMAGO is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the equity performance of the \"Magnificent 7\" - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - using an options 1 -based strategy designed to harvest option premium while maintaining equity-like exposure to these market-defining companies.\n\nThe fund combines direct exposure to the Magnificent 7 with a systematic put-spread 2 program implemented with listed options and FLEX Options® 3 to potentially generate income. The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the fund, please call (833) 759-6110 or visit the Fund's website.\n\nDistributor: Foreside Fund Services, LLC\nMedia Contact:\nMatthew Tuttle\nTuttle Capital Management\nmtuttle@tuttlecap.com\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/279159\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Here’s what you should know about the US TikTok deal\n\nLauren Forristal\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nWMT\n\nAMZN\n\nAPP\n\nTikTok , owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.\nAs a result, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension. Earlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.\n\nA number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle is finally over. As of last week , TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors.\nThis comes nearly three months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approves the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group.\nA week prior, President Trump announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.\nWho owns TikTok in the U.S.? According to a memo viewed by TechCrunch, the investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. Collectively, they will hold 45% of the U.S. operation, with ByteDance keeping nearly a 20% stake. Axios first reported the news, citing sources who estimate TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion—a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.\n\nIn September, a report indicated that a “framework” deal was established between the U.S. and China, with a consortium of investors— including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz—overseeing TikTok’s U.S. operations. These investors were expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares would belong to Chinese stakeholders.\nThe newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app’s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.\nOracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.\nA White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.\n\nStory Continues\nByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok’s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.\n​The deal is scheduled to close on January 22, 2026.\nWhat users in the U.S. should know Reports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app.\nHow did we get here? To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began in August 2020 , when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\n\nA month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.\nIn response, TikTok sued the U.S. government , challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\n\nFast-forward to today: Trump has had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nThere have been several contenders, including The People’s Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt . This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian , TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary , inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.\nAnother group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki , Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast .\nOthers in the running included Amazon , AppLovin , Microsoft , Perplexity AI , Rumble , Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick , and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\nThe story has been updated after publication.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

( NVDA , Financials ) investing $20 billion in AI inference business Groq shows its desire to dominate the AI ecosystem. Groq may continue operating independently while Nvidia uses its inference tools thanks to its founder Jonathan Ross and several engineers.Nvidia's planned diversification beyond AI training hardware is shown by the deal. Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPUs fuel most large-scale model training, but the company is now targeting inference, which has a far larger and recurring revenue potential.Over 90% of the AI GPU market is Nvidia. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq protects market dominance and adds software and service income streams while Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft construct their own inference processors to save costs.AI applications increase inference workloads considerably. AI token usage at major tech businesses increases every few months, fueling inference hardware and platform demand, say analysts.

Meanwhile, AI-linked power providers and cable and fiber producers such as Amphenol Corp., Corning Inc., NRG Energy Inc. and GE Vernova Inc. were among the Top 25.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nThat’s a shift from the last few years, when Nvidia Corp. — the original AI pick-and-shovel company — was entrenched among the top stocks in the S&P 500. The chip giant gained 40% in 2025, making it the 71st best performer in the index this year. While Nvidia and cloud hyperscalers Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are still powering the market due to their sheer size, their percentage gains have started to wane.\n“When the benchmarks are fairly concentrated, it’s important to look for themes that are gonna drive sales and earnings growth,” said Jake Seltz, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “AI is kind of one of those dominant themes right now, that’s nothing new. So we’re just looking, broadening our horizons beyond tech.”\n\nInvestors can find room to grow and better valuations by buying into the next wave of companies that are set to benefit from the billions of dollars hyperscalers are spending to build data centers.\n“What we are focused on are the picks and shovels of where that money is being spent,” said Matt Sallee, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which doesn’t own shares of any hyperscalers. “The chips to a degree, but more so some of the names that you haven’t really heard of.”\nOf course, there are some fears on Wall Street that the spending could slow, reversing gains in stocks tied to AI. It’s similar to what happened during the pandemic, when demand for basic home health products took off.\n“Covid hit and this world needed way more face masks, hand sanitizer, all those things,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management. But within six to 12 months there was a glut, and “those businesses that supplied those things went from the best times ever to the absolute worst times ever.”\nStill, investors remain bullish on the AI trade as the hyperscalers keep pledging to spend. Here’s what investors are buying now to play the tech infrastructure buildout.\n\nStory Continues\nData Storage\nWall Street expects data storage to remain hot in 2026 after Sandisk, Western Digital and Seagate surged in 2025. However, the boom times for this year’s winners may be coming to an end. For example, the average analyst price target for Sandisk in 2026 is $264, which would be a roughly 8% gain from where it currently sits at around $244.\n\nAnalysts see much bigger upside in a company like Pure Storage Inc., which is trading for $68 but is projected to reach $94 in 2026, a 38% leap. Other digital storage shares tied to AI include NetApp Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc.\nConstruction and Power\nA range of stocks associated with building and powering data centers are expected to keep running. Quanta Services Inc., which provides specialized contracting for utilities and telecommunications companies, is a top pick for Tortoise Capital’s Sallee. Other contractors include MYR Group Inc., Primoris Services Corp. and MasTec Inc.\nCompanies involved in wiring are also popular. They include Amphenol, which designs and manufactures high-speed fiber and copper interconnect solutions used in data centers, and Emcor Group Inc., which does mechanical and electrical construction. Other power infrastructure names include Vistra Corp., Constellation Energy Corp., GE Vernova and Generac Holdings Inc., which makes backup generators.\n\nBitcoin Miners\nBitcoin miners represent a potential “total revaluation story” as they pivot toward powering data centers and away from mining the cryptocurrency, according to Sallee.\n“They have the electricity already, they’ve had it for five-plus years to produce Bitcoin,” he said. “They’re going to redirect that electricity to higher-value, long-term contracts for high performance computing hosting.”\nNames in this area include Bitdeer Technologies Group, whose shares jumped in October after the company announced plans to move further into AI. Shares of IREN Ltd., Cipher Mining Inc., Riot Platforms Inc. and WhiteFiber Inc. have also received a boost from the companies’ intentions to convert to high-performance computing data centers.\nHeating and Cooling\n\nData centers require specialized precision controlled heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, creating demand for the companies that make them. Vertiv Holdings Co., which provides power systems and cooling solutions for data centers, is up 46% in 2025 and remains a stock to watch. Eaton Corp., another power management firm, overlaps with Vertiv but is less of a pure play, according to Seltz.\nOther names in the space include Comfort Systems USA Inc., which provides heating ventilation and air conditioning system installation and maintenance, as well as water providers Xylem Inc., Ecolab Inc. and American Water Works Co.\nSoftware\nSome investors with longer time horizons are looking to software as future beneficiaries of AI as large language models improve and more applications are built.\n\n“Investors are, I think, naturally inclined to look for companies that have cheaper valuations with terrific magnitude of growth that are potentially gonna really benefit from the application of AI,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha.\nSoftware stocks have generally underperformed this year, with the S&P 500 Software Industry Index rising 12% in 2025 compared with a 17% gain in the overall benchmark. But that has made the stocks’ valuations more appealing.\n“I don’t think those stories are dead,” said Allspring’s Seltz, who is watching names such as Snowflake Inc., Datadog Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. “It feels like it might be a little early, but the stocks do look attractive.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Could Be Among the First to Reach a $5 Trillion Valuation\n\nThomas Niel, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points In October, Nvidia's market cap briefly topped $5 trillion.\nWhile that particular \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has since pulled back, another member could join the $5 trillion club this year.\nGoogle parent Alphabet currently has a market capitalization of $3.8 trillion.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nBack in October, Nvidia became the first company with a market cap exceeding $5 trillion.\nNvidia's stock has since pulled back from that lofty level, but one big rally might be all it takes to lift the AI chip giant back above that value in 2026. Not only that, a few other companies could join that exclusive club, too.\nFor instance, as my fellow Motley Fool contributor Harsh Chauhan noted in an article on Dec. 20, Microsoft could conceivably hit that market cap milestone in the coming year .\nIn my view, another \" Magnificent Seven \" member also looks to be on the verge of joining the $5 trillion club: Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nWhy Alphabet is so close to hitting this milestone Alphabet shares have surged by 65% year to date. The primary reason for this has been the company's success in catching up to early adopters of generative artificial intelligence (AI) like Microsoft and OpenAI. Alphabet's Gemini 3 has given ChatGPT a run for its money.\nMore importantly, the AI Overviews and AI Mode features on the Google search engine have helped to increase user engagement with the platform. This has alleviated investors' initial concerns that the growing use of AI chatbots to answer people's questions would cut into Alphabet's primary profit center, search advertising.\n\nThanks to this year's significant share price run-up, Alphabet now has a market cap of $3.8 trillion. That means all it'll take for the company to reach a $5 trillion market cap is for it to appreciate in value by another 31.6%. Not only is that well within the realm of possibility in the next few years, there's a chance it could happen between now and next December. It all has to do with near-term earnings growth, coupled with the potential for the stock to experience further valuation expansion.\nCould it happen next year? According to sell-side analysts' estimates, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) could rise by over 41% between now and the end of 2028. This strongly suggests that it's a matter of when, not if, Alphabet will join the $5 trillion club.\nHowever, a move to that market cap could arrive as soon as 2026. Yes, the average sell-side analyst's earnings forecast may only call for 6% EPS growth next year, but those predictions may be too conservative. Even as Alphabet plans to ramp up spending on AI and cloud infrastructure, the payoff from these investments could take shape sooner than expected.\n\nStory Continues\nIn fact, we may already be witnessing this: Google's overall queries and revenue are growing by double-digit percentages thanks to AI integration. The sell-side forecasts at the high end of the range call for earnings growth of as much as 24% in 2026. Even if growth lands somewhere between the average and high end of the forecast range, that may lift the stock price by enough to get the company over the $5 trillion mark.\n\nShares currently trade for around 28 times expected forward earnings. If high growth persists into the coming year and bullishness about AI returns, names like Microsoft could again trade at forward P/Es in the mid-30s, and Alphabet could experience a similar rerating. Considering its plausible path to a $5 trillion market cap, Alphabet may be one of the first stocks investors should buy for the new year.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Meta to Acquire Manus in $2 Billion Bet on AI Agents\n\nKurt Wagner, Luz Ding and Lulu Yilun Chen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:18 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTCEHY\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nCRM\n\nNOW\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to buy Manus, a popular Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, in its effort to build a business around its massive AI investment.\nThe deal values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a rare US acquisition of an Asian tech company and the latest multibillion-dollar AI bet from Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The agreement was struck in about 10 days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are not public.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nMeta intends to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating it into its products, it said in a statement. Backed by some of China’s biggest names like Tencent Holdings Ltd., ZhenFund and HSG, Manus shot to prominence early this year not long after DeepSeek’s debut. All of its existing investors have been bought out in Meta’s takeover, one of the people said.\n“There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson said. Manus' parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\n\nZuckerberg has made AI his company’s top priority, and is spending billions to hire researchers, build data centers and develop new models. Manus had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year from selling its AI agent to businesses via subscriptions, which could give Meta a more immediate return on some of its AI spending\nThe Manus AI agent can complete a handful of general tasks, such as screening resumes, creating trip itineraries and analyzing stocks in response to basic instructions. Butterfly Effect raised money earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in an investment round led by US venture capital firm Benchmark.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nMeta's purchase of Manus is likely aimed at expanding the former's AI agent task capabilities, as it currently lacks applications built on its own foundation model compared to a broader application ecosystem for ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. While the deal marks an early step for Meta to build a subscription and API business around its AI investment, it could draw regulatory scrutiny given that Singapore-based Manus was founded in China.\n\nStory Continues\n— Mandeep Singh and Robert Biggar, BI analysts\nAI agents are tools that don’t need human supervision to perform specific digital tasks. Enterprise software companies such as Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. have heavily promoted their versions of agents as the most effective way for businesses to use the emerging technology, rather than generative AI features such as chatbots, which require user prompts and interaction.\n\nMeta already has an AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available through the company’s social media and messaging platforms — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — in addition to its AI glasses. The US company is acquiring the technology and leadership group from Manus, though its statement didn’t detail where the new team will sit within the organization. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the deal’s value, said Manus co-founder and CEO Xiao Hong will report to Javier Olivan, chief operating officer of Meta, citing people familiar with the acquisition.\nAlexandr Wang, Meta’s Chief AI Officer who joined this summer as part of a high-profile investment into his startup, welcomed the Manus team of about 100 staff with a post on X. In his own message on the platform, Manus’ Xiao said that the deal would help his company expand the reach of its agents. “The era of AI that doesn’t just talk, but acts, creates, and delivers, is only beginning,” he wrote. “And now, we get to build it at a scale we never could have imagined.”\n\nMeta’s aggressive spending to compete in the AI race is matched by rivals like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. Zuckerberg has pledged to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure projects over the next three years, many of them expected to be AI-related. The company has hired an expensive team of researchers to develop a new state-of-the-art AI model it plans to debut next spring, and has faced some skepticism from investors who worry that the heavy spending won’t result in meaningful revenue anytime soon.\nVC firm Benchmark was criticized earlier this year by lawmakers and other venture investors for backing an AI company with ties to China. “Who thinks it is a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me,” US Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, wrote in a post on X in May. Benchmark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Meta deal Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the deal during a regular press briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday referred reporters to relevant regulatory agencies without elaborating.\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Philip Glamann.\n(Updates with Meta comment in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.\nBuy the \"Mag 7\" Hyperscalers Or Are They Spending Too Much?\nAlthough they are among the world&rsquo;s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\n\nThis includes Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\nThere is no doubt that &ldquo;hyperscaling&rdquo; is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns\nNotably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billio\nROIC Comparison\nWith Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market&rsquo;s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\n\nAmazon&rsquo;s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance\nMagnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon&rsquo;s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon&rsquo;s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts\nAmazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500&rsquo;s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

On December 22, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that its Xbox Cloud Gaming is now out of beta and available to Xbox Game Pass Essential, Premium, and Ultimate subscribers.\nManagement noted that this will allow gamers to have access to a huge library of the latest games, wherever a gamer is connected to a compatible screen, a stable internet connection, and has a cloud-supported Xbox Game Pass subscription. The company highlighted that cloud gaming hours have gone up by around 45% since last year.\nThat said, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has gained roughly 16.52% year-to-date, and analysts expect more than 29% upside during the next 12 months. Recently, on December 22, Dan Ives from Wedbush, who is bullish on the technology sector and AI, released a note stating that Microsoft is undervalued as 2026 approaches. The analyst has a Buy rating on the stock with a $625 price target.\n\nIves noted that the analysts and investors have been underestimating the growth numbers for the stock. He added that the market is yet to realize the growth potential of Azure Cloud, stating the AI industry grows as per Ives’s projection. Ives believes that Azure Cloud and the company’s AI, Copilot has the potential to add another $25 in revenue throughout 2026.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides AI-powered cloud, productivity, and business solutions, focusing on efficiency, security, and AI advancements.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Alphabet vs. Microsoft: Better AI Stock to Own in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Microsoft's Azure has been the fastest grower of the big three cloud computing companies.\nAlphabet has a cost advantage with its custom AI chips that should become more evident starting next year.\nBoth stocks should perform well in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two of the largest cloud computing companies in the world, and both have been seeing strong growth as a result of artificial intelligence (AI) . However, in 2025, Alphabet's stock clearly shone; it's up around 65% as of this writing, compared to about a 16% gain for Microsoft.\n\nLet's see which stock is best positioned to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Microsoft Microsoft was hitting on all cylinders in 2025, although its stock still slightly trailed the performance of the S&P 500 heading into the final week of trading. Last quarter, the company grew its total revenue by 18% year over year and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 23%, as it saw strength across segments.\n\nThe growth is being led by its cloud computing unit, Azure, which has been the fastest growing of the big three cloud providers. Last quarter, Azure revenue surged 40%, driven by demand for AI services. It was the ninth consecutive quarter of 30% or more growth for Azure. Growth could have been even more robust if Azure were not capacity-constrained, and Microsoft said, given accelerated demand, that its capital expenditures (capex) will now grow at a quicker pace in fiscal 2026 versus last year.\nMicrosoft continues to have strong ties to OpenAI, with whom it owns a 27% stake. It also has exclusive intellectual property rights and privileged application programming interface access to its large language models (LLMs) through 2032. This, combined with OpenAI making an additional $250 billion in computing commitments, should help continue to drive strong growth in the coming years. The company has also struck a deal with Anthropic.\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology throughout its products -- such as its AI assistant copilots -- which is also helping to drive growth. An expected July price hike for Microsoft 365 enterprise users should boost revenue next year.\nThe case for Alphabet Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet's growth is being led by its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud. Last quarter, Google Cloud revenue soared 34%, while its segment operating income surged 84%. Although its revenue growth is a bit slower, the company has some strong advantages that should start to become more pronounced in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIts biggest edge is its custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). While Microsoft has developed its own custom AI chips, they are far behind Alphabet's TPUs, which were created more than a decade ago and have been tightly woven into its system. This gives it a large structural cost advantage over Microsoft, which is still reliant on Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs). Alphabet's TPUs are so good that Anthropic has placed a big order for them to run some of its AI workloads.\n\nAlphabet has also developed Gemini, one of the top LLMs in the world and another long-term advantage over Microsoft, which largely depends on OpenAI. This gives it not only more flexibility as it incorporates Gemini throughout its products but also more revenue streams. Meanwhile, by having both top-tier chips and AI models, Alphabet has created a flywheel effect that Microsoft just does not have.\nThe verdict Alphabet and Microsoft trade at similar valuations. Alphabet trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times 2026 analyst estimates, while Microsoft trades at 30 times fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) estimates and 26 times fiscal 2027 estimates. Given their valuation and growth outlooks, I think both stocks can perform well next year.\n\nHowever, I think that, ultimately, Alphabet's stock will once again outperform. The company has a long-term advantage in having the most complete AI tech stack, and that should become more noticeable next year, especially if it starts renting out its TPUs to more customers. Meanwhile, if Google search revenue continues to accelerate, driven by its AI initiatives, investors will likely start to bid up the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "2 Billionaires Just Loaded Up on Microsoft Stock. Do They Know Something We Don't for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:58 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Microsoft has lost to the market in 2025.\nThe company has a sizable investment in OpenAI.\nIts shares look expensive for the growth rate.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been an OK stock pick in 2025. While it's up around 15% so far in 2025, which would normally be considered successful, the S&P 500 is up more than 16%. This places Microsoft as a market loser, which nobody wants to own. However, the tides could shift in 2026, and Microsoft could be one of the best artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to own.\nTwo billionaires are incredibly confident in Microsoft's potential and loaded up on its stock during the third quarter. Is there something they know that we don't for 2026?\nBillionaires love Microsoft's stock The two billionaires I follow who loaded up on Microsoft stock during the third quarter were the legendary Peter Thiel and Daniel Loeb at Third Point. Thiel is a legend on Wall Street, as he was one of the founders of PayPal and Palantir Technologies . He was also one of the first outside investors of Facebook (now Meta Platforms ). When he makes a move, investors should pay attention, as he has a phenomenal track record.\n\nDuring Q3, Thiel sold off a hefty amount of Tesla stock and all of his Nvidia stock. He then used some of those proceeds to take a $25 million stake in Microsoft, now his second-largest holding. That's a big deal, and could indicate that he believes Microsoft is due for a strong 2026.\nLoeb at Third Point more than doubled its stake in Microsoft during Q3, and it now accounts for its third-largest position at 6.9% of the portfolio. That's a huge move, and signals something big could be coming.\nOther billionaires own Microsoft stock, like Chase Coleman at Tiger Global Management. Although he didn't buy any Microsoft stock in Q3, it's his portfolio's largest position at a 10.5% weighting.\nClearly, Microsoft stock is incredibly popular among billionaires, but why is that the case?\n\nMicrosoft is an AI facilitator Microsoft has delivered strong growth since the artificial intelligence arms race began. While it hasn't developed its own generative AI model, it has partnered with others who have. None is more significant than OpenAI. Microsoft owns about a 27% stake in OpenAI, so an investment in Microsoft acts as a proxy investment in OpenAI -- a company generally recognized as being one of the leaders of the generative AI movement.\n\nThat's likely the biggest reason why Microsoft is a top investment among these funds, but its regular businesses aren't too shabby either. During its fiscal 2026's first quarter (ended Sept. 30), Microsoft's revenue rose 18% year over year while diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 13%. Those are impressive figures, and a key part of that is Microsoft's top-tier cloud computing offering, Azure.\n\nStory Continues\nAzure grew 40% in the quarter, far outpacing some of its cloud computing peers. Azure has become a top spot to build AI applications in, as it offers access to multiple generative AI models -- not just OpenAI's ChatGPT. This makes it an attractive offering, and is a key reason why it's growing so quickly.\n\nMicrosoft may be doing well right now, but its market underperformance is something many investors are likely concerned about these days. Some of that value would be unlocked by OpenAI going public, as Microsoft's stake in OpenAI would be easier to value. Still, Microsoft is fairly pricey as is.\nAt a price-to-earnings ratio of 35, it's among the more expensive AI stocks on the market.\nWhile Microsoft's growth has been strong, it's nothing compared to what some others are proposing. This makes Microsoft's stock look expensive with no future in sight, which will make returns difficult to come by. I think Microsoft will be a market-average stock next year, with the only help coming from an OpenAI IPO.\n\nMicrosoft is a great company, but it just doesn't have the growth for me to recommend it over some other faster-growing AI stocks today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "Buy Stock in the Mag 7 Hyperscalers or Are They Spending Too Much?\n\nShaun Pruitt\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAlthough they are among the world’s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\nThis includes Amazon AMZN , Alphabet GOOGL , Meta Platforms META , and Microsoft MSFT , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\n\nThere is no doubt that “hyperscaling” is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns Notably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billion.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nROIC Comparison With Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market’s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\nAmazon’s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance Magnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon’s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon’s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\n\nStory Continues\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts Amazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500’s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Why anchoring 2026 portfolios in Big Tech and cybersecurity is the way to go\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWD\n\nGOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nANET\n\nThe next phase of the AI trade is more about growth and survival than simply chasing the most coveted names.\n\"I definitely wouldn't just bet on Nvidia,\" Adam Coons, chief investment officer at Winthrop Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. \"We kind of like to barbell this with something like the big hyperscaler, like an Alphabet Google, because that's really the type of name that you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because the AI story is just benefitting an already existing business model that was doing well.\"\nThe \"barbell\" strategy is born out of a growing skepticism toward \"one-trick ponies.\" In this case, Coons says it applies to companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), and Palantir ( PLTR ), which rely almost exclusively on the current AI hardware rush.\n\nWhile these names have led the market higher, their valuations have reached a point where \"margin of safety\" is effectively zero. In Coons's view, when a stock is priced to perfection, even a minor earnings miss can trigger a catastrophe.\n\"You need to position size,\" he said.\nBy anchoring a portfolio in \"behemoth hyperscalers\" like Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ), investors get exposure to AI through companies with diversified cash flows. Such companies aren't just AI plays, but are advertising and software giants that use AI to optimize businesses that were already succeeding.\n\nIf the \"safe\" end of the barbell is Big Tech, the other side is \"growth,\" and it can be found in the infrastructure required to keep those systems running and secure.\n\"Down the chain, we like the things that overall the AI story will help prop up,\" Coons said. \"For us, it's cybersecurity [as it] becomes more and more important.\"\nHe added that Fortinet ( FTNT ) and CrowdStrike ( CRWD ) are among \"two of our top picks on the security side.\"\nAs AI advances, so does the risk for hacking, Coons noted. Cybersecurity isn't a discretionary expense, but a tax on the digital age that must be paid. Unlike the volatile demand for graphics processing units, the need for protection is more predictable.\nThe sector isn't without its risks, however. CrowdStrike faced a global IT outage in July 2024, caused by a faulty software update. It prompted the \"blue screens of death\" across 8.5 million machines, including airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nCoons says the final piece of the 2026 investor blueprint is disciplined position sizing. He suggests building a \"basket\" of smaller, high-conviction names — like Reddit ( RDDT ), which he views as a unique data play for AI training — but with the caveat of keeping those positions small.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to Coons, the average investor should steer clear of trying to find the next Nvidia. The low-hanging fruit has been picked, and winning 2026 is more about leaning into the giants that own the platforms and the specialists who protect the data.\nAdditionally, Chris Versace, chief investment officer at Tematica Research, sees Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) and Arista Networks ( ANET ) as the next logical steps in the AI revolution.\n\nVersace argues that the massive spending on data centers is creating a \"network congestion\" problem. As AI usage explodes, the connection between chips becomes the new bottleneck.\n\"It's the network connection that will be the big bottleneck that I think folks are missing,\" Versace notes, pointing to Marvel because of its dominance in optical and networking hardware.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nEllie Diamond\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: FIG\n\nSTLA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAAPL\n\nThere are countless articles and profiles of entrepreneurs who dropped out of college. Fortune magazine recently featured several, including Figma CEO Dylan Field and Scale founder Lucy Guo, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire woman, who built her own fortune.\nInnovators like these young people make the news because they’re inspiring, intelligent and innovative. They’re also exceptional. which can make them unrealistic role models, according to Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from experience before striking out on their own.\n\nThe Exception, Not the Rule In October 2025, two entrepreneurs took the stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin. One was John Elkann, the chair and executive director of automaking giant Stellantis [ 3 ]. During his interview with Bezos, Elkann asked what he thought of the ideal of the prodigy entrepreneur.\nThese are personalities such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Steve Jobs. Each became hugely successful after rejecting the conventional pathway to success: a college education and years of climbing the ladder .\n\nElkann didn’t take this route, and neither did Bezos. They have great respect for those who did, but Bezos is quick to point out that it shouldn’t be an expectation.\n“It is possible to be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur ,” he said. “We have famous examples of that. But these people are the exception.”\nThe numbers back him up. A Clifford-Lewis Private Wealth study found that among the top 0.1% of rapidly growing new businesses, the founder’s average age was 45 at startup. Based on its data, Clifford-Lewis estimates that entrepreneurs have a much higher chance of success at 30 than at 20.\nSee Next: I Asked ChatGPT How To Build Wealth for the Rest of Trump’s Term: Here’s Its Plan\nTrending Now: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\n\nThe Value of Professional Experience Bezos started Amazon at age 30. He had graduated from Princeton University in 1986 and worked at several Wall Street companies, including Fitel and Bankers Trust. In 1990, he became the youngest-ever vice president of hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He opened Amazon in July 1995 at age 31.\nBezos said these 10 years of working for others improved Amazon’s chances of success . He gained hands-on experience leading a growing company, and these skills helped him guide Amazon through its early days of explosive growth. In only two years, he took the company public, with an initial public offering price of $18 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nBezos now counsels young aspiring entrepreneurs to follow a similar path. As he said in Turin:\n“I always advise young people, go work at a best-practices company where you can learn a lot of basic, fundamental things: how to hire really well, how to interview, etc. There’s a lot of stuff you would learn in a great company, and there’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it”.\n\nBezos believes that these early career lessons do what pure inspiration and talent cannot: They teach young entrepreneurs how to do things right from day one. This knowledge supports better decision-making, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could These 3 \"Recession-Proof\" Dividend Stocks Surge 100% by 2031?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:43 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKO\n\nJNJ\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a terrific growth stock with an excellent dividend program.\nJohnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola are both outstanding dividend payers.\nHowever, neither has the high-growth outlook that Microsoft sees ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nFears of a recession did not materialize this year. However, it's always worth it for investors to buy shares of companies that can perform well during economic downturns. Solid dividend stocks that routinely increase their payouts are especially attractive in that regard, since they tend to have businesses equipped to withstand challenging times.\n\nLet's discuss three stocks to buy to prepare your portfolio for any recession that may lay ahead: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) . Two of them are Dividend Kings , corporations that have achieved at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. All three are solid dividend payers.\nBut could they rise by 100% in the next five years? Let's find out.\n1. Microsoft Microsoft has moved sideways for the past six months. With a market cap of $3.5 trillion, some might argue that its high-growth days are behind it. But Microsoft still has plenty to offer growth-oriented investors and, in my view, is well-equipped to register the 14.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) necessary over the next five years to double in value.\n\nThe company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) looks especially promising. Microsoft's revenue from its cloud division, Azure, is growing rapidly, as is its contracted backlog, which is a strong indication that demand for the services Microsoft provides remains high.\nOne of the company's most notable partners is OpenAI, from which it recently secured a $250 billion Azure commitment. Through 2032, Microsoft will have intellectual property rights to OpenAI's models (still among the market leaders) and products.\nBeing able to offer OpenAI's models to its customers through Azure is a significant selling point for Microsoft, and it is likely one of the reasons it has been gaining ground on Amazon , the leader in cloud computing. From the looks of it, this tailwind will remain intact through the next few years.\n\nMicrosoft remains a terrific growth stock, and the dividend is almost a bonus. The company has increased its payouts by 152.8% in the past decade.\n2. Johnson & Johnson Several things make Johnson & Johnson an excellent \"recession-proof\" stock.\nFirst, since it sells healthcare products, including pharmaceutical drugs that remain in high demand regardless of economic conditions, it tends to generate consistent revenue and profits, even during economic downturns. Patients won't want to cut down on lifesaving drugs, and it also helps that third-party payers foot a lot of the bill.\n\nStory Continues\nSecond, Johnson & Johnson also has a rock-solid balance sheet with a credit rating above that of the U.S. government .\nThird, there is the dividend. J&J is on a streak of 63 consecutive payout increases. It is likely one of the safest dividend programs on the planet. All these factors make the healthcare leader a top pick for low-risk, dividend-seeking investors, but could it achieve the 14.9% CAGR necessary to double over the next five years? In my view, it is unlikely to do so.\n\nJohnson & Johnson faces several headwinds that could hinder its ability to deliver such outstanding returns. One of the most important is drug price negotiations in the U.S., with several of its medicines having already been targeted -- which will lead to lower prices for these products.\nTrue, Johnson & Johnson also has some potential growth avenues. It is working on a promising robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system, the Ottava, that will help it join this underpenetrated market. However, it will take some time for this to have a meaningful effect on its results. None of that means Johnson & Johnson isn't a buy, though. It just means that the stock probably won't double in five years.\n3. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola is a leading consumer staples company -- an industry that is also famously resilient. Even when the economy isn't doing well, the beverage maker attracts a decent amount of business thanks to its famous brand name (and many other smaller brands, some of which dominate their niches), and a large portfolio of products across most drink categories.\n\nThis is also an innovative company that routinely launches new products, or just repackages old ones in ways to make them more attractive in current market conditions. That includes catering to price-sensitive consumers. People can cut down on beverages during recessions more easily than they cut down on medications.\nHowever, Coca-Cola's strategy can somewhat limit (though not eliminate) the effect of this threat. It has, after all, allowed the company to perform well over the past few decades and maintain a strong dividend program throughout. With a streak of 63 consecutive dividend increases, it is also a Dividend King.\nCoca-Cola is highly unlikely to double in the next five years. It will face stiff competition and macroeconomic headwinds (including inflation and tariffs), coupled with relatively slow volume and revenue growth, which hardly fit the profile of a high-growth stock capable of doubling in five years. These challenges won't break Coca-Cola's business, but they also limit its upside.\n\nThe stock remains a reliable and steady choice for income investors. But seekers of high growth should look elsewhere.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "Can Microsoft Stock Rally on Dynamics 365 Business Applications?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:53 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nCRM\n\nORCL\n\nMicrosoft 's MSFT Dynamics 365 suite is emerging as a significant growth driver that could propel the stock higher, with the business applications platform demonstrating robust momentum in the enterprise market. The company's Dynamics 365 revenues surged 21% in constant currency during the first quarter of fiscal 2026, outpacing broader cloud services growth and signaling strong enterprise adoption.\n\nThe platform's success stems from its comprehensive integration of customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning capabilities, enhanced by artificial intelligence features through Copilot. Organizations are increasingly adopting Dynamics 365 to streamline operations, with the solution processing more than 10 billion customer interactions monthly across its ecosystem. The business applications segment now serves more than 46,000 organizations globally, reflecting expanding market penetration.\n\nMicrosoft's strategic investments in AI-powered automation within Dynamics 365 are differentiating the platform from competitors. Features like Copilot for Sales and Customer Service are reducing manual workflows while improving decision-making accuracy. The company reported that organizations using AI-enhanced Dynamics applications achieved 30% faster case resolution times, driving measurable productivity gains.\n\nThe commercial cloud infrastructure supporting Dynamics 365 provides additional upside potential. As enterprises expand their digital transformation initiatives, the platform benefits from network effects and increasing customer lifetime value. With Dynamics 365's growth trajectory exceeding overall commercial cloud expansion and strong renewal rates indicating customer satisfaction, the business applications segment represents a compelling catalyst for Microsoft's stock appreciation. The combination of market share gains, AI integration, and operational leverage positions Dynamics 365 as a sustained revenue growth engine through fiscal 2026.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: Oracle and Salesforce Performance Oracle ORCL and Salesforce CRM remain formidable competitors in the business applications space. Oracle reported that its Fusion Cloud Applications revenues grew 17% in constant currency during its recent quarter, with Oracle's cloud ERP and HCM solutions gaining traction among large enterprises. Salesforce delivered 8% revenue growth in its latest quarter, though Salesforce's core CRM platform faces pricing pressures. Oracle continues investing heavily in AI capabilities across its applications suite, while Salesforce has integrated Einstein AI features throughout its Service Cloud and Sales Cloud offerings. Both Oracle and Salesforce maintain substantial installed bases, though growth rates vary across their respective product portfolios as market competition intensifies.\n\nStory Continues\nMSFT’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates MSFT shares have lost 5.8% in the past three-month period, underperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry's decline of 8.3% and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector's return of 5.5%.\nMSFT’s 3-Month Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, MSFT stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio of 10.4X compared with the industry’s 7.57X.

Do they waste a whole day trying to find the next big play in AI or do they just say, you know what? Nvidia's going to win this whole damn thing? I'm just going to bet on them again next year.\n00:15 Adam\nYeah, I definitely wouldn't uh just bet on Nvidia. I I think you do need to do your homework if you want to buy specific names. I think probably the general investor is probably better finding some sort of basket to kind of play the overall space. Uh but we're very early innings in this and\n00:41 Adam\nobviously Nvidia is the winner right now, but uh to say, you know, in five years that we look back that they're going to be the dominant player still, very, very unlikely. Like I said, this is really an evolving space. So I I would be careful with something that's so specific as Nvidia. Uh we kind of like to barbell this with, you know, something like the the big hyperscaler like a like an Alphabet Google, uh because that's really the type of name that uh you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because they just\n01:14 Adam\noverall, the AI story is just benefiting an already existing business model that was doing well. So, I think you would just want to be careful with what we're calling kind of the one trick ponies, like a Nvidia, uh a Core Weve or a Patier right now.\n01:31 Speaker A\nUh, Brooke, let me get over to you because I think what you're seeing in industrial metals and some of the things that Adam's talking about fits nicely with what we heard from Ed Yardini this morning that he might see it is likely to see we are likely to see a broadening out in this rally. Investors doing their homework, trying to get outside of the tried and true Mag 7.\n01:53 Brooke\nYeah, Brian, what we did hear from Ed Danny over the weekend was really ongoing momentum in this market in 2026. He maintained that year end target for the S&P 500 of 7,700 and he said largely it won't be really led by uh the Mag 7, but also what he called the impressive 493 of the S&P 500 as really this broadening out, this boost in productivity growth really leads to overall returns for the\n02:26 Brooke\nS&P 500 in 2026. Specifically, you know, he went on to say that that is really where exactly investors should be thinking about this mindset. You know, not really overweight technology, but more so thinking about the other users of AI as opposed to just the producers of AI. And so certainly he's not alone in this uh momentum that he thinks will exist within 2026 ongoing from what we've seen so far in the returns in 2025.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) are down -0.28%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) are down -0.27%.\n\nStock indexes are moving lower today, led by losses in megacap technology stocks. Also, today's plunge in metals prices is weighing on mining stocks. Lower bond yields are supportive of stocks, with the 10-year T-note yield falling to a 1-week low of 4.10% today.\nMore News from Barchart Santa Claus Rally, Fed Minutes and Other Can't Miss Items this Week\nMicron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMP Materials Gained 230% in 2025.

The recent surge in both metals has taken prices to overbought levels, sparking technical selling. Also, the CME today raised margin levels for precious metals trading, which has sparked some long liquidation pressure.\nCrude oil prices are up by more than +2% today, lifting energy producers and limiting losses in the broader market, as advanced peace talks over the weekend to end the Ukraine-Russian war failed to yield a breakthrough. Geopolitical tensions from Venezuela to Nigeria are also supporting crude prices. In addition, crude prices rose after China's Ministry of Finance on Sunday pledged to broaden its fiscal spending base next year, signaling government support to drive economic growth.\n\nSeasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.\nMarket attention this holiday-shortened week will focus on US economic news. Later today, Nov pending home sales are expected to climb +1.0% m/m. On Tuesday, the Dec MNI Chicago PMI is expected to rise by +3.5 points to 39.8. Also, the minutes of the December 9-10 FOMC meeting will be released. On Wednesday, initial weekly unemployment claims are expected to increase by 1,000 to 215,000. On Friday, the Dec S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unrevised at 51.8.\n\nStory Continues\nThe markets are discounting the odds at 19% for a -25 bp rate cut at the FOMC's next meeting on January 27-28.\nOverseas stock markets are mixed today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.17%. China's Shanghai Composite climbed to a 6-week high and closed up +0.04% for the ninth consecutive daily gain. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.44%.\n\nInterest Rates\nMarch 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) today are up by +4 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.6 bp to 4.112%. Mar T-notes rose to a 1-week high today, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1-week low of 4.102%. Today's stock market weakness is boosting safe-haven demand for T-notes. Also, geopolitical risks in Venezuela and Nigeria have added to the safe-haven appeal of T-notes.\nEuropean government bond yields are moving lower today. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.836% and is down -1.4 bp at 2.848%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-week low of 4.459% and is down -0.7 bp to 4.500%.\nSwaps are discounting a 2% chance of a +25 bp rate hike by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.\n\nUS Stock Movers\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly lower today, pressuring the broader market.

Can she claim Social Security at 62 and later switch to spousal benefits?\n‘Is it a case of them or us?’ We’re in our 40s. Do we retire early in our 50s — or save for our kids’ education?\nLogan Paul’s $5.3 million Pokémon bet raises a bigger question: Do collectibles belong in your portfolio?\nThe hot AI trade faces a 1980s style trap and these risks, says this market bull\n\nWhich lane has the best risk-reward?\nMason\nDear Mason, All three lanes lead somewhere. The question is which one fits your risk tolerance.\nPure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum QBTS are lottery tickets with better odds. They’re not competing with the Magnificent Seven; they’re auditioning to be acquired by them. If one of these companies cracks a genuine commercial advantage, it becomes a buyout target overnight. High risk; asymmetric upside.\n\nThe Mag Seven are already in: Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN have billion-dollar quantum programs. So does IBM IBM. You’re not betting on whether they’ll participate. You’re betting on whether quantum becomes material to their earnings this decade. Safer, but the quantum upside is diluted by everything else in the stock.\nInfrastructure is where the near-term money lives. Post-quantum cryptography is already a compliance issue. NIST standardized new algorithms in 2024, and every government contractor, bank and defense company needs to upgrade. That’s not speculative. That’s a budget line-item.\nThe picks-and-shovels play isn’t qubits. It’s the classical-quantum interface: cryogenic systems, control electronics, error-correction software. Less sexy than “we built a quantum computer” — and more likely to generate revenue this decade.\n\nMy bias? I own positions across all three lanes, but I’m most interested in security infrastructure. That’s the toll road everyone has to drive on.\nDiversified but opinionated,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best investors in the mobile revolution didn’t bet on which phone would win. They bet on Qualcomm’s QCOM chips inside all of them.\nDear Charlie, Quantum computing is just another fantasy — like AI was for decades. Error correction is still unsolved.\nThis is vaporware.\nNancy\nDear Nancy, Error correction was unsolved. Past tense.\n\nLa historia continúa\nIn December 2024, Google’s Willow chip became the first quantum processor to demonstrate “below threshold” error correction. That’s the holy grail physicists have chased for 30 years. The chip showed that scaling up qubit arrays, from 3×3 to 5×5 to 7×7, reduced error rates instead of compounding them. That’s never happened before.\n\nThree weeks later, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in topological qubits. Amazon’s Ocelot chip cut error-correction costs by 90%. IBM confirmed it’s on track for a 100,000-qubit system by 2029. A University of Chicago professor called it “escape velocity.”\nYou’re right that quantum computing was vaporware for decades. So was AI. In 2020, experts said artificial general intelligence was 50 years away. In 2024, AI writes code, passes the bar exam and diagnoses cancer better than radiologists.\nThe difference between “decades away” and “here” is usually about 18 months of denial.\nStill skeptical after all these years,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best time to invest in a technology is when smart people still think it’s a fantasy.\nDear Charlie, North Korea stole $2 billion in crypto in 2024. When quantum computing matures, all encryption is at risk. What makes you think bitcoin BTCUSD survives?\nAlex\nDear Alex, You’re conflating two different problems: hackers and hardware.\nNorth Korea didn’t crack bitcoin’s cryptography. It compromised employees. The Bybit heist, around $1.5 billion, came from social engineering and insider access, not supercomputers. That’s not a quantum threat. That’s a human one.\nNow, the real question: What happens when quantum computers can break elliptic curve cryptography?\n\nAnswer: Everything breaks. Not just bitcoin. Google, Microsoft, the U.S. Federal Reserve, every bank, every military system, every government database on earth. If quantum computing cracks bitcoin, it’s already cracked the entire digital infrastructure of modern civilization. Bitcoin isn’t the first domino. It’s somewhere around the 40th.\nBut here’s what the doomsayers miss: bitcoin upgrades. The U.S. government’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) — the same agency that sets the standards for everything from weights and measures to cybersecurity — standardized quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms in 2024.\nThe bitcoin network can migrate to post-quantum signatures. Active coins move to new addresses with new encryption.\n\nLost bitcoins, including founder Satoshi’s, stay frozen in old addresses. That’s roughly 4 million coins in vulnerable P2PK addresses that become unspendable. Security goes up. Circulating supply goes down. That’s not a death sentence for bitcoin. That’s a supply shock.\nTimeline? Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang says 15 to 30 years before quantum computers can break current encryption. Bitcoin security expert Jameson Lopp estimates bitcoin needs five to 10 years to complete a migration. The math works.\nQuantum computing is a threat to everything. That’s exactly why it isn’t a special threat to bitcoin.\nWatching the sausage get made,\nCharlie\nP.S. North Korea’s hackers don’t need quantum physics. They just need your password.\nDear Charlie, Horizon scanning is no longer optional. First movers will be those who translate technical complexity into business strategy.\nDon’t you agree?\nSarah\nDear Sarah, Exactly right.

      "Content": "Americans have more cash in stocks than ever, a ‘red flag’ for equities. Where to shift your money instead for 2026\n\nJing Pan\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:03 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: GC=F\n\n^GSPC\n\nBRK.A\n\n^IXIC\n\nKR\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nThe U.S. stock market has surged to new highs recently — good news for investors, at least on the surface. But with Americans now holding more of their wealth in stocks than ever before, some economists warn that what comes next may be far less rosy.\n\nJohn Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, says Americans’ stock ownership has even surpassed levels seen in the late 1990s — right before the dot-com boom went bust (1).\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“That should ring alarm bells, even if the buoyant stock market keeps rising for a while amid enthusiasm for AI,” Higgins wrote in a note to clients, adding that “the current very high share of equities is a red flag to watch closely.”\nAccording to Federal Reserve data cited by CNN, 45% of Americans’ household financial assets are now in stocks — an all-time high. That includes direct shareholdings as well as mutual funds and retirement accounts.\nEven with periodic sell-offs — such as the sharp plunge in 2020 when the pandemic hit — the broader trend has been a powerful climb. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has returned more than 230% (2), while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has soared about 430% as of December 2025 (3).\nStill, Rob Anderson, U.S. sector strategist at Ned Davis Research, points out that record levels of stock ownership have historically coincided with increased risk of a downturn.\n\n“Investors shouldn’t expect the same magnitude of returns that we’ve seen during the last decade to repeat. Going forward, over the next 10 years, there’s probably going to be a downshift in returns,” Anderson cautioned.\nAnd economists aren’t the only ones worried. A recent Bank of America survey found that 91% of fund managers believe U.S. stocks are overvalued — the highest reading in data going back to 2001 (4).\nEven veteran investors are taking cover. Legendary investor Jim Rogers recently revealed that he’s sold all his U.S. stocks, warning he’s “seen this party before” (5). And Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has been making other investors nervous since 2024 by selling off large quantities of stock each quarter (6).\n\nStory Continues\nAnd that’s not getting into the “Buffett Indicator,” which tracks stock market performance relative to GDP. The idea goes that when the stock market overperforms compared to the economy, it can indicate an overvaluation of market capital. The indicator sat at 230% of GDP in September 2025 (7).\nIf you’re concerned about where markets might head, here are four ways to help protect your wealth.\n\nA golden hedge for ‘bad times’ When investors start worrying about dark clouds over the market or slowing returns, gold often shines brightest.\nThe precious metal’s appeal is simple: Unlike paper money, gold can’t be printed at will by central banks. And because its value isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, it’s long been viewed as a safe haven — especially when markets lose their footing.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, recently highlighted gold’s importance in a resilient portfolio.\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” Dalio told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier.” Dalio has advocated for up to 15% of a portfolio’s value to include gold.\nThe precious yellow metal has also been on a historic run this year, driven partly by shaky investor confidence in the stock market. Gold is up 60% year over year, and is on track to see even more growth in 2026. After a November slump, the spot price rallied yet again and hit a new record-breaking high of over $4,500 per ounce (8).\nOne method that some people use to invest in gold is a self-directed gold IRA .\n\nA gold IRA allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms while also providing the significant tax advantages of an IRA.\nIf you’re not sure where to start, you can check out some of Moneywise’s top picks for gold IRAs to compare your options for free. Just keep in mind that gold is often best used as one part of a well-diversified portfolio.",

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:33 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\n3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. , Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\nGlobal e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN&rsquo;s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon&rsquo;s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is &ldquo;Growing at a pace we haven&rsquo;t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we&rsquo;ve been focused on accelerating capacity &mdash; adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.&rdquo;\nExtensive AI Applications\n\nAmazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called &ldquo;Project Rainier.&rdquo; This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers&rsquo; queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\nAMZN&rsquo;s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance\nAmazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp.\nMicrosoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT&rsquo;s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company&rsquo;s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength\nMicrosoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN&rsquo;s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT&rsquo;s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company&rsquo;s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\n\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business\nGoogle Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon&rsquo;s AWS and Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\n\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions\nZacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

I was in the 9:00 a.m. hour and they were making the case for healthcare. If you had to stack up these two sectors side by side, you got uh AI plays, you got the Mac 7, healthcare. What excites you more and why?\n01:22 George\nYeah, I don't really like any of those the best. I think healthcare's seen a significant rally in the closing parts of 2025. If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "4 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:43 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nIREN\n\nCRDO\n\nNVDA\n\nBTC-USD\n\nKey Points Palantir and Nvidia are large companies at the forefront of the AI revolution.\nIren Limited is a Bitcoin miner, but it just inked a huge deal with Microsoft to supply cloud computing capacity.\nCredo Technology's wiring solutions may not be sexy, but they help data centers function better.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nOne of the greatest appeals of cryptocurrencies is their massive potential. That market can be very challenging, and investors are often swept away by some of the sudden, huge gains they read about each year. There are dozens of cryptocurrencies with more than a 100% gain in the last seven days.\nHowever, chasing these kinds of gains can be frustrating, as for every success story, there are digital coins that fade away just as quickly, leaving investors with a proverbial pile of dust. It's impossible to predict which cryptocurrencies will be the next big winners and which will vanish into obscurity.\nHowever, you don't need to chase crypto to build wealth. You can find some great companies in the stock market that will give you outsize gains and make crypto investors green with envy. Tech stocks have been some of the best investments you can make in the last year, and I'm expecting that to continue in 2026.\nIf you want explosive growth potential, I'd wager that these four tech stocks are great possibilities -- and all of them have a compelling growth story that makes them superior to cryptocurrencies.\n1. Palantir Technologies It's true that Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) isn't a perfect company. Its valuation is a major concern, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 267 and a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 104 at the time of this writing. Those numbers indicate that for a typical company, these shares are extraordinarily expensive and the stock could be ripe for a correction.\n\nBut Palantir isn't a typical company. The data analytics company is growing fast thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which allows users to access Palantir's powerful network with minimal training. Palantir saw 63% revenue growth in the third quarter as it closed 204 deals valued at more than $1 million each. It's in high demand among both military and commercial clients.\nPalantir stock is up 155% so far this year -- the third-best performance in the Nasdaq-100 -- and that follows gains of 167% in 2023 and 340% in 2024.\nI would be shocked if Palantir stock doesn't grow another 100% or more in 2026.\n2. Nvidia Semiconductor maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been slowing down as of late -- but who can really expect the stock price to maintain its torrid pace? Nvidia shares rose 819% from 2023 to 2024, and followed that up with a 37% gain in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are bundled by the thousands in data centers to train and run high-level artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning programs. Nvidia holds a substantial lead in the data center chip market, with estimates ranging from 86% to 92% of its market share. Its huge advantage stems from chip superiority as well as its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel computing architecture that allows developers to write and develop code on Nvidia GPUs.\n\nNvidia reported in its last quarter that it sold out of data center GPUs, and its Blackwell line is flying off the proverbial shelves. When Nvidia rolls out its next-generation architecture Rubin line in 2026, I'm expecting equally strong demand.\n3. Iren Limited We're seeing incredible growth in data centers, and that's going to continue through 2026 and beyond. As more companies develop AI products to help manage their businesses or draw in new customers, there's an increasing demand for data centers to cluster GPUs and run AI programs. Researchers at BloombergNEF estimate that at least 150 data center projects have been announced in the U.S. over the last year, and data center power demand in the U.S. is expected to grow from 25 gigawatts to 106 gigawatts by 2035.\n\nIren Limited (NASDAQ: IREN) has six data centers in Texas and Canada with 2.9 GW of capacity. And it has a new $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft to provide cloud computing capacity using Nvidia GPUs.\nBuilding data centers is really expensive, but Iren has an advantage because it makes most of its money from Bitcoin mining, which allows it to operate at a profit while other data center companies are operating in the red. It made $232.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 from Bitcoin mining, accounting for nearly all of its $240.3 million of total revenue.\nIren gives you the advantage of Bitcoin -- the most stable cryptocurrency -- without holding the coins yourself. And you also get to invest in a tech stock that has its fingers in data center expansion.\n\n4. Credo Technology This one may sound a little out of left field, as Credo Technology (NASDAQ: CRDO) is down 21% since Dec. 22. But I'm confident that this is just temporary weakness, as Credo is an indispensable company for the data center expansion already discussed.\nCredo makes the wiring that links GPUs together in data centers. Instead of traditional wiring, Credo's active electrical cables (AECs) include signal processors that help the data move faster and more efficiently. Management says they are 1,000 times more reliable and consume half the power as optical wiring.\n\nCredo's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending Nov. 1, 2025) was $268 million, up 272% from a year ago. Income of $82.6 million resulted in earnings of $0.44 per share.\nDespite the recent pullback, Credo stock is up 121% this year and has a strong runway ahead of it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now? Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

On December 22, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities appeared on a CNBC Television interview to talk about his bull case for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). He says that investors are underestimating Microsoft and Azure growth. ​\n\nIves highlighted that during the last month, the company witnessed a 20% to 25% acceleration in deals, as a result of AI use cases finally exploding. He added that with the company expected to release earnings in January, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a table pounder, and 2026 is its call year. Ives also believes that among hyperscalers, Microsoft has been the most overlooked and least respected.​\nRegarding valuation concerns of the AI hyperscalers and whether Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is immune to these valuation threats, Ives noted that investors are still underestimating the growth numbers. He elaborated that the demand-to-supply ratio stands at 12 to 1, suggesting huge room for growth. Ives believes that the Street is underestimating Microsoft’s 2026 growth figures by at least 15% to 20%. ​\n\nThat said, Dan Ives maintained an Overweight rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a $625 price target, suggesting more than 28% upside from the current level.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

He was 83.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nIBM chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna announced Gerstner’s death in an email sent Sunday to its employees, but didn’t provide a cause of death.\n\nGerstner’s nine-year tenure as chairman and CEO of the company known as “Big Blue” is often used as a case study in corporate leadership.\nOn April Fool’s Day, 1993, he became the first outsider to run IBM, which was facing a choice of bankruptcy or dismemberment after a period when it had been the undisputed leader in personal computers and mainframes. He pivoted the Armonk, New York-based company toward business services and away from hardware production, reversing a move to break up the company into a dozen or more semi-autonomous units — “Baby Blues” — in pursuit of greater profits.\nGerstner slashed costs and sold off unproductive assets, including real estate and IBM’s collection of fine art. He fired 35,000 of the 300,000 employees, who had become accustomed to a culture of lifetime tenure based on principles established by former CEO Thomas Watson Sr. in the early 20th century.\n\nHe stressed company-wide teamwork to replace the tradition of loyalty to various divisions, and he pegged compensation to corporate performance rather than individual results. To meet performance goals, he emphasized regular accountability rather than waiting for yearly performance reviews.\n“People do what you inspect, not what you expect,” he said.\nGerstner’s key change was to scrap IBM’s culture of selling bundled products that only worked with other IBM goods, from PCs to operating systems to software. Products he considered losers were jettisoned. He pulled the plug on OS/2, an operating system intended to challenge Microsoft’s Windows that hadn’t proved popular with customers.\n“His leadership during that period reshaped the company,” Krishna wrote. “Not by looking backward, but by focusing relentlessly on what our clients would need next.”\n\nFocus on Middleware\nIBM put its focus on so-called middleware — software for databases, systems management and transaction management. The company became the impartial integrator for companies’ networks and systems, happy to help whether the hardware used had the IBM name on it or not.\nGerstner made an early bet on the internet and e-business, which he guessed correctly would put less emphasis on personal computers and more on servers, routers and other more sophisticated equipment that would benefit from IBM’s service know-how and involve buyers familiar to IBM’s sales force, such as chief technology officers.\n\nStory Continues\nLater in his tenure, he also made some strategic acquisitions such as the $2.2 billion paid for Lotus Development Corp., whose Notes product was vital for helping IBM customers collaborate on an enterprise-wide basis.\nThe switch in focus from hardware to services resulted in an increase in services revenue from $7.4 billion in 1992 to $30 billion in 2001. IBM’s share price went from $13 to $80 in his nine years as CEO, adjusted for splits,.and IBM’s market value rose from $29 billion to about $168 billion in that period.\n\n“If I had a vote, the most significant legacy of my tenure at IBM would be the truly integrated entity that has been created,” he wrote in (2002). “It certainly was the most difficult and risky change I made.”\nLouis Vincent Gerstner Jr. was born on March 1, 1941, in Mineola, New York, to Louis Gerstner Sr., a milk truck driver, and Marjorie Rutan, a secretary and college administrator. He was one of four brothers.\nHe graduated from Mineola’s Chaminade High School, a competitive Catholic institution. He got an engineering degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard University.\nMcKinsey Partner\nAfter Harvard he joined McKinsey & Co. as a consultant. He made partner in four years and spent 12 years there before taking a job with American Express.\n\nHe worked for the credit-card division there, then took over travel-related services. Under his leadership, Amex, which offered primarily a travel card at that point, increased its presence in retail stores and created premium cards that permitted customers to carry unpaid balances.\nWith his way to the top of management at Amex blocked by CEO James D. Robinson III, Gerstner agreed to run RJR Nabisco Inc., where he stayed four years before joining IBM. His primary focus at RJR Nabisco was to reduce the $25 billion in debt produced by the leveraged buyout that created the tobacco and consumer products firm.\nIBM’s board began its search for a new CEO after it forced out John Akers in January 1993, just as the company was reporting its largest annual loss. In selecting Gerstner, the board chose managerial experience over computer expertise. (Gerstner’s brother Richard had worked for IBM for 30 years and headed the division that included personal computers.)\nFrom Gerstner’s first day in April 1993 until the January 2002 announcement that he was stepping down, IBM’s shares rose ninefold while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 154%. Sam Palmisano succeeded him, first as CEO, then as chairman when Gerstner retired at the end of 2002.\nIn 2003, Gerstner became chairman of the Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private-equity firm. He oversaw the firm’s expansion into Asia and Latin America and early preparations for going public, which it did in 2012. He retired in 2008, remaining as a senior adviser.\nWith his wife, Robin, he had two children. Their son, Louis III, died in 2013 after a choking accident in a restaurant.\n\nThrough Gerstner Philanthropies, the family has supported biomedical research, environmental and education programs, and social services in New York City, Boston and Florida’s Palm Beach County. The family has been a longtime supporter of the Mayo Clinic.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThe United States of Klarna\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Ahead of 2026, According to Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Palantir)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Morningstar analysts recently ranked Nvidia and Microsoft as the two best artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\nBrian Colello at Morningstar says Nvidia has an economic moat due to its leadership in GPUs, networking, and software tools needed for artificial intelligence.\nDan Romanoff at Morningstar says Microsoft’s cloud computing unit has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence due to investments in OpenAI.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nPalantir Technologies has been one of the best-performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent years. Shares have advanced 1,000% since January 2024, but many analysts worry about its valuation. That may explain why Palantir did not appear on Morningstar 's recent list detailing the best AI stocks to buy now.\nInstead, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took the top two spots, followed by Amazon , Broadcom , and Meta Platforms . But optimism concerning Nvidia and Microsoft is not limited to Morningstar. Most Wall Street analysts believe the stocks are undervalued.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $190.\nAmong 63 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 29% upside from its current share price of $488.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Morningstar analyst Brian Colello writes:\nTo summarize, Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its full-stack strategy. The company is best known for its GPUs, chips that accelerate demanding data center workloads like AI training and AI inference. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs best-in-class GPUs with CPUs, high-speed interconnects, and networking platforms, such that the company essentially builds entire data centers.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has spent the better part of two decades creating its CUDA software platform, which comprises an unparalleled number of code libraries, pretrained models, and application frameworks that assist developers. While custom AI chips developed by Broadcom may be cheaper, the total cost of ownership is often higher because they lack pre-built software tools.\n\nStory continues\nNvidia has over 90% market share in data center GPUs, a market where sales are projected to grow at 36% annually through 2033, and the company is likely to maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 48% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2028. That makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look cheap.\n\n2. Microsoft Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for Microsoft 365 (a suite that includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), the company also has a strong position in other software verticals, including business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning.\n\nMicrosoft has added generative AI copilots to several software products and monthly active users surpassed 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter. And CEO Satya Nadella told analysts, \"Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services sales. \"Azure has several distinct advantages, including that it offers customers a painless way to experiment and move select workloads to the cloud,\" according to Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff. \"Based on its investment in OpenAI, the company has also emerged as a leader in AI.\"\n\nMicrosoft owns a 27% equity stake in OpenAI and it has exclusive rights to the AI start-up's most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5). Also, The Information reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the agreement. Those payments will top $1 billion this year, up from about $500 million last year, according to TechCrunch.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% during the last four quarters, which makes the current valuation look more reasonable. Nvidia is still the more attractive option, but I think patient investors should consider buying a small position in both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Watch: DebitMyData Human Energy Grid .\nThe Crisis: Billions Spent, Projects Stalled\nSince 2022, the world’s largest AI companies have pledged more than $200 billion to build data centers powering generative intelligence. Yet projects remain paralyzed across multiple jurisdictions — halted by community opposition, regulatory confusion, and growing fears that “AI progress” benefits only corporations, not citizens.\n\nDebitMyData’s solution reframes the equation.\nBy valuing human participation in data exchange, energy contribution, and consent verification, the Human Energy Grid introduces an economic model where infrastructure growth yields tangible local and individual benefits — aligning corporate expansion with community trust.\n“Before the Genesis Order, we already understood the next frontier,” said Preska Thomas,, Founder and CEO of DebitMyData, Inc. “The challenge isn’t building more compute — it’s building more trust. Without societal consent and economic inclusion, the AI revolution can’t scale sustainably.”\nPhase One: Building the Workforce Trust Layer\nDebitMyData.com serves as the activation point. Through it, the company is organizing and credentialing a next-generation digital workforce — those displaced or at risk from AI automation — into the coming grid economy.\n\nParticipants gain:\nVerified Digital Identities (DID): Anchored in secure, LLM-backed protocols enabling individuals to control, monetize, and consent to their data usage. Watch: DebitMyData Custom Logo and Facial Recognition .\nCreator Economy Readiness:Training and compensation models that align with the future AI-driven labor ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nCollective Grid Participation: Future integration into the Human Energy Grid, where digital identity links directly to energy, compute, and compensation systems.\nThis workforce mobilization positions DebitMyData as not just a technology platform, but a human readiness layer—the connective tissue between displaced labor and infrastructure modernization.\n\nPhase Two: Partnering for Ethical Infrastructure\nAs DebitMyData expands the DID and labor participation network, the company is laying the groundwork for the Human Energy Grid, a compliance-ready trust layer for data centers and AI infrastructure providers.\nFor technology giants and developers facing mounting public resistance, Human Energy Grid provides the missing compliance bridge:\nCommunity Consent Intelligence: Blockchain-backed verification that satisfies local governance and environmental mandates.\nPublic Benefit Integration: Energy, water, and data transparency mechanisms that turn traditional opposition into shared prosperity.\nRapid Onboarding:\nDebitMyData’s API and DID infrastructure retrofit easily with existing energy, cloud, and AI systems—no rip-and-replace required.\n\nWe’re creating the social infrastructure that lets hyperscalers build compliantly, governments verify trust transparently, and citizens profit directly from the AI age,” said Founder Preska Thomas. This isn’t just technology—it’s economic realignment.”\nThe Path Forward\nDebitMyData is not waiting for AI to displace millions before responding. It is architecting the response mechanism itself: a data economy that rewards human contribution as much as computational horsepower.\nFor workers,it’s a new revenue channel and pathway back into participation.\nFor governments,it’s a verifiable consent framework.\nFor investors, it’s the foundation of the world’s most scalable ethical infrastructure.\nFor hyperscalers, it’s the bridge from resistance to readiness.\n\nAbout DebitMyData, Inc.\nDebitMyData, Inc. is a U.S.-based technology company building the intersection of AI, energy, and human participation. Its ecosystem—anchored by DebitMyData.com and the forthcoming Human Energy Grid —creates a blueprint for ethical AI expansion, enabling communities, companies, and governments to scale intelligence with trust.\nRegistered with the U.S. government’s SAM system and assigned an official CAGE number, DebitMyData is eligible for federal infrastructure, cybersecurity, and AI trust contracts under the Genesis initiative.\nPress & Partnerships :\nMedia Direct Line: +1-754-315-2420\nEmail press@debitmydata.com\nWebsite: www.debitmydata.com\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/14664b9f-4b0e-40e2-9430-7ff648c8e588\nVideos accompanying this announcement are available at:\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5445850e-9a29-4229-a358-bf2f77778292\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/30effb7b-3512-4ef7-844e-caa2cf59b075\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: 1 Artificial Intelligence Stock Will Lead the Next Bull Market\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IREN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points AI chips are required to power AI tools, but those chips are useless without energy.\nAI data center provider IREN is one of the leaders that recently signed a lucrative deal with Microsoft.\nIREN's AI cloud revenue projections suggest that the company's revenue can surge in the years ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Iren ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the best investing opportunities in recent decades. It combines the excitement of the dot-com bubble with real revenue growth. AI models showed investors how quickly people would adopt AI products and services that could compete with established options like search engines. Now, with humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, and other innovations on the horizon, AI stocks look poised for another rally.\nSemiconductor stocks were the defining group of investments during the first stage of the AI boom, but another group of stocks will be the next winners. Energy is at a premium for AI workloads, and few companies look as compelling as IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) as the next AI rally takes shape.\nEnergy is the new bottleneck Solving any AI bottleneck can result in billions of dollars in annual revenue with skyrocketing prospects. Nvidia continues to prove this truth with impressive revenue growth while becoming the first company to reach a $5 trillion valuation.\nNvidia's AI chips solved a critical part of the AI bottleneck, and energy is next. Nvidia and other tech companies are actively seeking solutions to the power supply gap. Since AI apps require significant energy, there's an energy shortage that few companies can solve. Traditional data centers don't even get the job done, since their infrastructure isn't set up to handle the complex workload of AI software.\n\nThat's why tech giants have turned to AI data center providers that have sufficient energy to meet the demands of AI tools. Some tech leaders are acquiring AI data companies before their value is fully realized. For instance, Alphabet just bought AI data center company Intersect for $4.75 billion. The acquisition demonstrates how much capital Alphabet and its competitors are willing to put into AI data centers like IREN.\nEach contract offers annual recurring revenue IREN's biggest contract came in November, when Microsoft received 200 megawatts of critical IT load. It's a five-year deal that comes to $9.7 billion, or almost $2 billion in annual recurring revenue. IREN also received a 20% prepayment, which will help it fund additional AI data centers.\nIREN has a multi-gigawatt pipeline that can support additional deals. It's reasonable to assume that IREN will secure additional gigawatts in 2026 and build additional sites. IREN co-CEO Dan Roberts said in September that IREN can't meet demand fast enough, which suggests that more sites will be announced in the future.\n\nStory Continues\nEach AI data center can provide multiple deals like the Microsoft one. Billions of dollars in annual recurring revenue make it easier for the company to scale its revenue growth, especially as AI demand continues to grow. IREN can announce another contract like the Microsoft deal and immediately see its annual revenue go up by more than $1 billion per year. Few companies have that type of opportunity to scale quickly.\n\nAI cloud annualized revenue growth is astronomical IREN still makes most of its revenue from crypto mining, but AI infrastructure is the future. That future is coming quite soon, based on IREN's goal of reaching $3.4 billion in AI cloud annualized run-rate revenue by the end of 2026.\nThat's a sizable jump, since AI cloud revenue only came to $16.4 million in fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30. IREN also reported $7.5 million in AI cloud revenue in first-quarter fiscal year 2026, which ended on Sept. 30. A jump to more than $3 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2026 is a massive jump that suggests a high growth rate is still possible in 2027 and beyond.\n\nIREN has a lot of room to expand its annual recurring revenue based on its multi-gigawatt pipeline. The company's ability to build AI data centers on time without missing deadlines will help the company scale its services into additional locations. Chips were the major bottleneck a few years ago, and they're still doing well.

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nMSFT\n\nTSM\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is a leader in e-commerce and fintech.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are making waves with their respective AI innovations.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the top chip manufacturer in the world.\n10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre ›\nInvesting for the long term requires a disciplined and resilient mindset to navigate the inherent volatility of the stock market. Managing the psychology behind your investment decisions is as crucial as selecting the right investments.\n\nThe market price of a stock is often driven by short-term emotions and news, while its true value is tied to the underlying company's long-term earning power and assets. A strong mindset allows you to view temporary price drops as potential buying opportunities for quality assets, not reasons to panic.\nLikewise, if you're focused on the long-term picture, you can select quality businesses with robust fundamentals that make sense as part of your portfolio without being swayed by short-term market volatility. If you have cash to invest in the stock market right now, here are four stocks to consider buying and holding for at least five years.\n1. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the clear e-commerce leader across over a dozen countries in Latin America, including major markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. It has a significant competitive advantage over global players like Amazon due to its established presence, brand recognition, and deep understanding of local market needs.\n\nThe company operates a vast tech ecosystem, including its e-commerce marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, which is powered by its integrated fintech arm Mercado Pago, its robust logistics business Mercado Envíos, and advertising services. It's worth noting that Mercado Pago has grown into a full digital financial services platform (e.g., payments, credit, savings, investments) that serves the region's large unbanked population and has created a sticky user base with high monetization potential.\nThe company is consistently profitable and boasts impressive growth metrics. In Q3 2025, it reported a 39% year-over-year revenue increase. Total net revenue reached $7.4 billion. Total payment volume reached $71 billion, up 41% year over year, and gross merchandise volume rose to $16.5 billion, a 28% year-over-year spike.\n\nRobust e-commerce performance in core markets like Brazil and Mexico bolstered MercadoLibre's quarterly performance. And, the number of successful items sold grew by 39% year over year to 635 million. If you want to invest in an e-commerce and fintech giant operating outside the U.S., MercadoLibre is a profitable and compelling leader to consider.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) managed to effectively monetize generative AI faster than most peers by integrating it across its entire tech stack. AI services accounted for roughly 15 percentage points of the total Azure revenue growth in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026. Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, which has created a high-margin recurring revenue stream.\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI capacity, and its capital expenditures have exceeded $30 billion per quarter to meet surging demand. Azure remains a primary catalyst for the business's long-term value and consistently delivers high growth even on a massive revenue base. For the full fiscal year 2025, Microsoft's annual revenue surpassed $281 billion, growing by 15% from the prior year. Azure revenue was more than $75 billion, a 34% increase year over year. Azure holds approximately 20% of the global cloud market.\nMicrosoft maintains one of the strongest balance sheets in the corporate world, which supports its consistent returns to investors. It's one of only two U.S. companies with a perfect AAA credit rating (that's higher than the U.S. government). The company generated over $100 billion in net income in fiscal 2025, so it continues to have massive flexibility for R&D and acquisitions.\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years and regularly repurchases billions in stock (it returned almost $11 billion to shareholders in the most recent quarter alone through dividends and share repurchases). Management and analysts have set ambitious targets for the next five years. CEO Satya Nadella aims to exceed $500 billion in annual revenue by 2030, nearly double its current scale.\n3. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is deeply integrating powerful AI models like Gemini across its massive ecosystem (e.g, Search, YouTube, Cloud). AI improves its search relevance, makes YouTube more engaging, and personalizes user experiences, which in turn can drive better engagement and more ad dollars. Instead of cannibalizing search, Alphabet's new tools like AI summaries are increasing ad impressions and conversions, and expanding its commercial pathways in search.\n\nAlphabet is also leveraging its custom TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) semiconductor chips to compete in cloud infrastructure. While historically the company had reserved most TPUs for in-house use and cloud services, it has recently begun selling some directly to third parties in specific bilateral deals. These include major AI clients like Anthropic as Alphabet creates a new high-margin revenue stream.\nAlphabet's TPUs are revolutionary, particularly because they are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) purpose-built for the core mathematical operations of deep learning applications. This specialized design provides significant advantages in performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness at scale compared to the more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Revenue from TPUs is a key driver of the overall Google Cloud segment's growth, which generated robust Q3 2025 revenue of $15.2 billion, a 34% year-over-year increase.\n\nAnalysts from firms like Morgan Stanley project that expanded external sales could add billions in new revenue to Alphabet's top line in the coming years (an estimated $13 billion for every 500,000 units sold by 2027). AI could also unlock opportunities in robotics (Waymo), healthcare, and enterprise solutions outside of Alphabet's traditional advertising and cloud businesses. Alphabet's strong balance sheet with substantial cash and low debt, and a generous history of providing enviable returns to shareholders, are icing on the cake for long-term investors in this storied business.\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) or TSMC is the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing and controls roughly 70% of the global foundry market. Unlike investing in a single chip designer, holding TSMC can allow investors to profit regardless of who wins the AI race. And the reality is that there will likely be many winners as the AI revolution heats up.\n\nThe demand for AI computing power is soaring, and only a few companies possess the capabilities to design the required chips. All major AI players -- including Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom -- rely on TSMC to build their most advanced chips. The company produces at least 90% of the world's most advanced chips, which has created a massive technological moat that competitors like Intel and Samsung are currently struggling to bridge.\nManagement expects AI-related revenue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. TSMC had a very strong Q3 2025 financially and beat expectations with both record profits and revenue. Substantial and growing demand for AI chips and high-performance computing (HPC) drove revenue up over 30% year over year. Net income surged 40% year over year, and TSMC's gross margin improved to 59.5%.\n\nTSMC is aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of Taiwan. The company has committed $165 billion to build six advanced fabs in Arizona, with the first already being in volume production. Additional major investments are underway in Japan and Germany, and management aims to have 30% of its most advanced capacity located outside Taiwan by 2028. Shares are up about 40% year to date, and it may be wise to scoop some up before the business soars higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "I pioneered machine teaching at Microsoft. Building AI agents is like building a basketball team, not drafting a player\n\nKence Anderson\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nCRM\n\nSalesforce&#8217;s latest agent testing/builder too l and Jeff Bezos’s new AI venture focused on practical industrial applications of AI show that enterprises are inching towards autonomous systems. It&#8217;s meaningful progress because robust guardrails, testing and evaluation are the foundation of agentic AI. But the next step that’s largely missing right now is practice, giving teams of agents repeated, structured experience. As the pioneer of Machine Teaching, a methodology for training autonomous systems that has been deployed across several Fortune 500 companies, I’ve experienced the impact of agent practice while building and deploying over 200 autonomous multi-agent systems at Microsoft and now at AMESA for enterprises around the globe.\n\nEvery CEO investing in AI faces the same problem: spending billions on pilots that may or may not deliver real autonomy. Agents seem to excel in demos but stall when real-world complexity hits. As a result, business leaders do not trust AI to act independently on billion-dollar machinery or workflows. Leaders are searching for the next phase of AI’s capability: true enterprise expertise. We shouldn’t ask how much knowledge an agent can retain, but rather if it has had the opportunity to develop expertise by practicing as humans do.\nThe Testing Illusion Just as human teams develop expertise through repetition, feedback and clear roles, AI agents must develop skills inside realistic practice environments with structured orchestration. Practice is what turns intelligence into reliable, autonomous performance.\nMany enterprise leaders still assume that a few major LLM companies will develop powerful enough models and massive data sets to manage complex enterprise operations end-to-end via “Artificial General Intelligence.”\n\nBut that isn’t how enterprises work.\nNo critical process, whether it be supply chain planning or energy optimization, is run by one person with one skill set. Think of a basketball team. Each player needs to work on their skills, whether it be dribbling or jump shot, but each player also has a role on the team. A center’s purpose is different from a point guard&#8217;s. Teams succeed with defined roles, expertise and responsibilities. AI needs that same structure.\nEven if you did create the perfect model or reach AGI, I’d predict the agents would still fail in production because they never encountered variability, drift, anomalies, or the subtle signals that humans navigate every day. They haven’t differentiated their skill sets or learned when to act or pause. They also haven’t been exposed to expert feedback loops that shape real judgment.\n\nStory continues\nHow Machine Teaching Creates Practice Machine Teaching provides the structure that modern agentic systems need. It guides agents to:\nPerceive the environment correctly.\nMaster basic skills that mirror human operators.\nLearn higher-level strategies that reflect expert judgment.\nCoordinate under a supervisor agent that selects the right strategy at the right time.\n\nTake one Fortune 500 company I worked with that was improving a nitrogen manufacturing process. Our agents practiced inside the AMESA Agent Cloud, improving through experimentation and feedback. In less than one day, the agent teams outperformed a custom-built industrial control system that other automation tools and single-agent AI applications could not match.\nThis resulted in an estimated $1.2 million in annual efficiency gains , and more importantly, gave leadership the confidence to deploy autonomy at scale because the system behaved like their best operators.\nWhy CEOs and Leaders Need Practiced AI Practice is what drives true autonomy in agents. I invite every leader to begin reframing a few assumptions:\nStop thinking in terms of models and think in terms of teams. Every day interactions with systems like ChatGPT or Claude are powerful, but they reinforce a misconception that large language models are the path to enterprise autonomy. Autonomy emerges from specialized agents that take on perception, control, planning and supervisory roles through a wide variety of technologies.\nIdentify where expertise is disappearing and preserve it within agents. Many essential operations rely on experts who are nearing retirement. CEOs should ask which processes would be most vulnerable if these experts left tomorrow. Those areas are the ideal starting point for a Machine Teaching approach. Let your top operators teach a team of agents in a safe practice environment so that their expertise becomes scalable and permanent.\nRecognize that you already have the infrastructure for autonomy. Years of investment in sensors, MES and SCADA systems, ERP integrations and IoT telemetry already form your organization’s backbone of digital twins and high-fidelity simulations. Success requires orchestration, structure, and leveraging the data foundation you already built.\n\nThe Payoff of Practice When enterprises give agents room to practice before deployment, several things happen:\nHuman teams begin to trust the AI and understand its boundaries.\nLeaders can calculate true ROI rather than speculative projections.\nAgents become safer, more consistent and aligned with expert judgment.\nHuman teams are elevated rather than replaced because AI now understands their workflows and supports them.\nAgents won’t truly perform without experience, and experience only comes from practice. The companies that invest in and embrace this framing will be the ones to break out of pilot purgatory and see real impact.\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune .\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But Baird Tech Strategist Ted Mortonson is warning that a \"tremendous amount of volatility\" could be coming to the AI trade next year. He also explains why some portfolio managers may have to sell shares of some tech companies if AI giants like Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) go public in 2026 .\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Ted\nRight now, I think if you look at 26, we're going to have a tremendous amount of volatility. The AI trade is very well understood, at least through my client base with\n00:20 Ted\nthe you look at the infrastructure build really outpacing enterprise uh adoption. And that's the issue. Uh we're going to spend at a 40% clip here for the next couple years. Uh the Sox is up, the semiconductor index is up uh almost 48% year to date. And if you look at the IGV or the software index that's been the big laggard, only up 7.8%. So all I think of this is understood. As we uh as we look into 26, there's there's three issues that I'm uh looking at very, very closely and we can go in that if you'd like to.\n00:54 Speaker B\nYeah, I'd like to go into that. And maybe Ted, on that on that point you just brought up, I just want to drill into that. This this mismatch as you say between the the data center build out and the the real enterprise AI adoption. When would you expect Ted then to see that enterprise AI adoption story play out? Is is is that a 2026 story, Ted? Is it 2027? What do you think?\n01:21 Ted\nRight now, that's a it's hard to nail down, but I don't think it's 26. The enterprise, there's only roughly 30% of the Global 2000 that's ready to move to Gen AI. 70% is still going through data cloud migration and uh data cleansing to get into an LLM. So, we've got, you know, enterprise it always takes so much longer than the street is looking at. That mismatch probably goes into 27, 28 is my guess.\n01:54 Speaker B\nAnd and how what are the signs and signals Ted as investors I would be looking for to say, okay, now we're really saying seeing AI monetization, not just AI marketing. I mean, am I looking at software spend? Am I watching the cloud businesses? Like what should I be looking for, Ted?\n02:22 Ted\nI think I think it's it's well understood that the cloud Titans are going to see it in token growth as well as just their their overall cloud growth. Where I think it's really instrumental to see enterprise adoption is uh via your last few guests, is in the software area. Specifically on the agentic plays, whether it be, you know, a CRM, a ServiceNow, a hubspot, um, you know, and then the whole security sector is moving to AI. I think if you see robust, um, uh net new ARR, that's that's going to be a very good indication of enterprise uh adoption.\n03:22 Speaker B\nYou you another theme Ted, I want your take on which you wrote about was obviously, you know, the massive uh CAPEX by tech giants. But of course we've seen these concerns creeping up at least with some names Ted, financial stress, you know, debt loads, and I'm just curious how you're thinking through that dynamic.\n03:52 Ted\nWell, my clients do not want to play names that are negative free cash flow. Uh this is one of these cycles because of this mismatch in infrastructure, it's very capital intensive on this infrastructure build. So the only real names that really have the the the businesses behind it to really uh fund the capX is Microsoft and Google and that you know, Google's up 87% uh year to date. Um so with with that, um I I think uh there's a propensity to just watch and have some dry powder. Um I don't have a lot of interest in some of the negative free cash flow names at this point. And it's obvious I think as we go forward that you're getting indications that whether it be Anthropic or whether it be Open AI or SpaceX, that the debt market is tapped and the it's not big enough quite frankly to fund the infrastructure build. So all of these next generation companies are going to have to tap the equity market. And my worry there is very simple after doing this for a few decades is when you have four or five major tech companies that have to raise just a boatload of capital. Open AI has been rumored a hundred billion dollars. My worry is that we get some time in the in in 26 where all these guys come public at the same time and we drain quote unquote the equity liquidity lake, if you will. And my PMs are going to be forced to sell some of their winners to to fund some of these uh positions in these new companies.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Like many AI stocks this year, Lumen has put up market-beating returns: It's up 38% through Dec. 22, compared to the S&P 500 's gain of 17%.\nDespite the stock's recent success, let me be the first to say this to prospective investors: Wait until reality matches the hype before putting money into Lumen.\nThe hype surrounding Lumen Technologies A lot of the hype surrounding Lumen revolves around the deals it has struck with companies like Microsoft and Alphabet . The terms of these deals make Lumen a major provider of networking capabilities for these companies. On the surface, they look like significant wins for the business -- especially as AI infrastructure spending increases.\n\nAccording to Lumen CEO Kate Johnson, the company is \"building the backbone of the AI economy.\"\nThe reality of Lumen Technologies' business But when you pull back the curtain on the headlines and look into Lumen's finances, there are causes for pause. To begin with, Lumen has over $17.5 billion in long-term debt, which is more than double its nearly $8 billion market cap at the time of this writing. It was able to refinance $2.4 billion of that debt, saving it $135 million in annual interest, but it still expects to pay over $1 billion in interest this year alone.\nTake into account Lumen's debt, interest obligations, and the fact that it lost $621 million in the third quarter on $3.08 billion in revenue, and it's clear that it's burning through cash faster than its AI ambitions are paying off.\nLumen's losses are expected to continue. On the company's latest earnings call, management said it didn't expect to get back to revenue growth until 2028. And operating at a loss isn't always a red flag because many growth stocks follow that model for a time as they prioritize expanding their top lines before shifting focus to profits.\nHowever, in Lumen's case, it's not a new start-up building from scratch. It's a company that has been around since 1968, trying to pivot from a struggling legacy business into a high-growth industry while accumulating a lot of debt along the way.\n\nStory Continues\nSure, aiming to be the \"backbone of the AI economy\" sounds enticing, but investors shouldn't take those words to heart until Lumen shows it can sustain profitability and chip away at the massive debt load that's holding it back from making key investments in other areas.\nShould you buy stock in Lumen Technologies right now? Before you buy stock in Lumen Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lumen Technologies wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Amazon vs. Microsoft: Which Stock Is a Better Buy for 2026 and Beyond?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:26 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Amazon and Microsoft have both seen their cloud revenue growth accelerate recently.\nBoth companies are spending massive sums of money to capture soaring demand for AI computing.\nOne stock's valuation arguably looks more attractive.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) enter 2026 with the same headline tailwind: enterprises are rebuilding their tech stacks around cloud computing and generative AI (artificial intelligence) . Even more, they have similar headwinds: the capital-intensive nature of building out AI infrastructure -- and more AI demand than they can handle (or is that a tailwind?).\nRegardless, these are two great companies with stocks likely to perform well over the long haul, but one looks slightly more attractive than the other.\nAmazon: More than an e-commerce business If you think Amazon is primarily an e-commerce business, think again.\nThe company's third-quarter net sales rose 13% year over year to $180.2 billion, while operating income came in at $17.4 billion -- and AWS (Amazon's cloud business, called Amazon Web Services) alone produced $11.4 billion of that operating income.\n\nEven more, this lucrative cloud business is seeing accelerating growth. AWS revenue increased 20% year over year to $33.0 billion in the third quarter. That is a clear step up from the 17.5% AWS growth Amazon posted in the second quarter.\nAnd it gets better. Amazon has another fast-growing profit lever beyond e-commerce: advertising. The company's third-quarter advertising services revenue rose 24% year over year in Q3.\nBut free cash flow is moving in the wrong direction. Amazon's trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased to $130.7 billion in Q3, yet free cash flow fell from $47.7 billion to $14.8 billion as capital spending rose.\nMicrosoft: a fast-growing software giant In a win for Microsoft over Amazon, its overall business is growing faster. The software giant's revenue grew 18% year over year to $77.7 billion, and operating income rose 24% to $38.0 billion.\nLike Amazon, Microsoft's cloud business is the primary driver behind the tech company's growth. Microsoft cloud revenue, for instance, grew 26% year over year to $49.1 billion. With that said, Microsoft's cloud business includes more than cloud computing. It's made up of Microsoft 365, Commercial Cloud, Azure, Dynamics 365, commercial revenue from LinkedIn, and more. Still, Azure (Microsoft's could computing business) is a key driver for Microsoft's overall cloud revenue. The company's \"Azure and other cloud services\" revenue increased 40% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's not surprising that, like Amazon, Microsoft is investing heavily in AI-capable cloud computing. The company is not only seeing growing demand from Azure customers looking for AI computing, but it is also integrating AI across its products and services.\n\"Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings release. \"It's why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.\"\n\nThe tiebreaker So, Microsoft may be growing faster than Amazon. However, Amazon's AWS is the leading cloud infrastructure platform -- a position that may make its recent aggressive investments less of a gamble for its shareholders. Whatever the case, both companies notably have diversified businesses and have enough excess capital to invest heavily in the AI boom to capture any opportunities.\n\nThe tiebreaker probably ultimately boils down to valuation. Amazon's forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 28 is slightly below Microsoft's of about 31, giving it the edge (albeit a small one) in a head-to-head comparison.\nSo, if I had to choose a winner here, I'd choose Amazon. That's arguably the better of the two stocks for 2026 and beyond.\nOf course, there are risks for both stocks. The main one is that both companies' huge spending on AI computing doesn't pay off in the revenue and profits that management anticipates. Investors should keep a close eye on these evolving risks; if the AI boom fizzles out, investors may have to reassess whether these stocks deserve the premium valuations they currently have. But, ultimately, these are two stocks I believe will do well over the long haul.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that these stocks will almost certainly trade with meaningful volatility, given the constantly changing nature of their industries and their stocks' premium valuations. Investors who think Amazon or Microsoft look attractive today, therefore, should consider keeping any position in these stocks small, given the risks. They could always add more to their positions if the stocks take a hit.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal Is a Warning Shot to AI Rivals\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 12:12 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points NVIDIA has solidified its leadership position by securing the industry's fastest inference technology to power real-time artificial intelligence applications.\nThe company used its substantial free cash flow to fund this strategic expansion while also returning capital to investors through a cash dividend.\nThis strategic move effectively neutralizes potential competition by integrating top engineering talent and proprietary technology into the NVIDIA ecosystem.\nInterested in NVIDIA Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nWhile the markets were quiet for the post-Christmas trading session, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) made a noise that will echo for years. The company announced a definitive agreement to pay approximately $20 billion in cash to license the technology and hire the core engineering team of AI chip startup Groq.\nThe timing of this announcement is poetic. On the very day NVIDIA is distributing its quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share to loyal shareholders, it is aggressively reinvesting its massive cash pile to secure its future dominance. The market reaction has been swift and bullish. NVIDIA shares climbed roughly 1.5% following the news, trading in the $188 to $191 range. This move pushes the company’s market capitalization firmly past the $4.6 trillion milestone.\n\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nWall Street’s reaction reflects a clear consensus: this is not just a purchase; it is a fortification. By securing the fastest chip technology in the market, NVIDIA is widening its competitive moat against rivals like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD). This deal helps ensure that NVIDIA remains the only game in town for the next phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\nHow Groq Solves NVIDIA’s Speed Limit To understand why NVIDIA would spend $20 billion on a startup, investors must first understand how the AI market changed in 2025. For the last three years, the industry focused on Training. This is the process of teaching an AI model, which requires massive amounts of raw computing power to crunch data. NVIDIA’s Blackwell and Hopper GPUs were perfect for this heavy lifting.\n\n→ These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nHowever, late in 2025, the market reached a tipping point known as the Inference Flip. Global revenue from using AI models (Inference) officially surpassed the revenue from building them (Training). While training is a one-time event, inference is a continuous, 24/7 utility, much like electricity. Every time a user asks a chatbot a question or a robot moves, that is an inference event.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Speed Problem As AI moves into real-time applications like voice assistants and humanoid robotics, speed becomes the critical metric. This created a vulnerability for NVIDIA because its chips were designed for size rather than speed.\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nThe Freight Train: NVIDIA’s GPUs are like massive freight trains. They have an incredible capacity to haul data, but they take time to get up to speed. They are optimized for throughput (volume), not instant speed.\nThe Formula 1 Car: Groq’s technology, known as the Language Processing Unit (LPU), is built differently. It is like a Formula 1 car, lightweight and capable of instant acceleration.\n\nThe Benchmark Gap Data shows that Groq’s LPUs can process between 300 and 500 tokens per second on standard models like Llama 2. In comparison, a standard GPU setup typically manages around 100 tokens per second. By absorbing this technology, NVIDIA ensures it owns the fastest solution for the fastest-growing segment of the market. This also addresses a total cost of ownership risk; because Groq chips are faster, they use less energy per task, which appeals to cost-conscious data centers.\n\nThe Smartest Deal in Tech: How NVIDIA Avoided the FTC In today's strict regulatory environment, a standard merger between a $4.6 trillion giant and a rising competitor would likely be blocked by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Regulators are wary of monopolies buying up their rivals. NVIDIA’s management navigated this risk by structuring the deal as a reverse acqui-hire and a non-exclusive licensing agreement rather than a traditional corporate acquisition.\n\nHow the Deal Works: Licensing: NVIDIA pays for the right to use Groq’s intellectual property in perpetuity, but Groq retains theoretical ownership.\nHiring: NVIDIA hires the majority of Groq’s engineering staff and leadership.\nIndependence: The Groq corporate entity technically remains independent, avoiding the mandatory antitrust waiting periods required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act.\n\nThis structure mirrors successful strategies recently employed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It allows NVIDIA to integrate the technology immediately without getting bogged down in 18 to 24 months of litigation. This speed of execution is a major bullish signal for the stock, as it prevents competitors from catching up while the deal is stuck in court.\nA Blow to Rivals Perhaps the most valuable asset in this deal is the human capital. NVIDIA has hired Jonathan Ross, the founder of Groq. Before starting Groq, Ross invented the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) at Google. By bringing Ross into the fold, NVIDIA has effectively neutralized a key competitor and deprived Google, its biggest rival in custom silicon, of the talent that built its foundation.\n\nThe Buy vs. Build Calculation: Why This Deal Was Cheap A $20 billion price tag is massive for most companies, but for NVIDIA, it represents a highly efficient use of capital. Investors should view this through the lens of buy vs. build. Could NVIDIA have built this technology itself? Likely yes. But it would have taken three to four years of research and development. In the fast-moving world of AI, three years is an eternity. By spending cash now, NVIDIA buys time.\n\nBy the Numbers: Free Cash Flow: In the third quarter alone, NVIDIA generated $22.1 billion in free cash flow. Effectively, the company paid for this entire strategic expansion with just three months of cash generation.\nShareholder Rewards: As a testament to this financial strength, NVIDIA is paying out its quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share today , Dec. 26. This proves that the company can fund massive growth while rewarding shareholders simultaneously.\n\nValuation Perspective Despite the stock trading near all-time highs, analysts argue that the valuation is reasonable given the growth potential. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 23x. This is significantly lower than its trailing P/E of around 52x, suggesting that earnings are growing fast enough to justify NVIDIA’s current stock price. By securing the Groq technology, NVIDIA protects these future earnings from competitive erosion.\n\nNVIDIA’s Evolution Into the OS of AI This transaction serves as a powerful reminder that NVIDIA is evolving. It is no longer just a hardware vendor; it is becoming the inevitable operating system for the entire AI economy.\nLooking ahead, investors can expect NVIDIA to integrate Groq’s low-latency technology into its upcoming Rubin architecture and its robotics initiative, Project GR00T . With fourth-quarter r evenue guidance projected at $65 billion , the company’s fundamentals remain flawless. This deal silences the bear case that competitors would eventually catch up in speed. For investors, the thesis remains intact: NVIDIA is building the foundation for the future of artificial intelligence.\nThe article \" NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal Is a Warning Shot to AI Rivals \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Things have only gone downhill for the stock as Wall Street began doubting the story.\nORCL stock has plummeted by over 40% from its peak after Q2 earnings. FY 2026 earnings disappointed investors. Analysts began piling concerns about how overextended data center spending was and whether it was even sustainable for Oracle to fund the growth. Investors baked in a valuation that would only make sense if Oracle managed to grow at a blistering pace for years with ever-growing margins.\nBut now that ORCL stock is down from its peak, should you buy the dip or jump ship? Let's first take a look at what's wrong here.\n\nWhy investors are dumping ORCL stock Investors' pet peeve with Oracle is that the funding is proving to be quite unreliable. News came out that Blue Owl Capital was withdrawing from its funding commitments, meaning that Oracle's $10 billion Michigan data center was in jeopardy. Oracle denied this and said that the news reports were \"incorrect\". Oracle's Partner, Related Digital, said that Blue Owl did not withdraw unequivocally and that the company still had others willing to fund the project.\n\nIn any case, this has thrown sand into the gears. Q2 FY 2026 didn't help, either.\nIt invited a fresh wave of criticism after Oracle reported $16.06 billion in revenue, up 14.22% year-over-year. This missed the estimates by $134.2 million. EPS did beat estimates by a wide margin, but this was due to a one-time boost from Oracle selling its Ampere stake.\nThe Wall Street Journal pointed to another \"squishy number\" that investors are paying more attention to as Oracle's story looks more brittle. Remaining performance obligations (RPOs) have surged to $523 billion. What are these RPOs? Sales that management believes are probable. Half a trillion dollars of \"probable\" sales looked more or less guaranteed a few months back. But with that Blue Owl debacle and the AI buildout catching more flak, Wall Street is less willing to price that in.\n\nStory Continues\nTime to go bottom fishing with ORCL stock? If those RPOs do convert to sales, the picture looks rosier than ever, but it's still worth keeping in mind how quickly things can go wrong. For example, Oracle has a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, set to begin in 2027.\nIf the AI train continues full steam ahead, maybe it's possible that OpenAI will be able to spend $300 billion on Oracle cloud compute resources over five years, as per the agreement. I don't believe that \"maybe\" will translate into reality, as OpenAI does not have $300 billion.\n\nPer Oracle, they expect to grow Cloud Infrastructure revenue \"...77% to $18 billion this fiscal year—and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.\" The majority of Oracle's promised revenue generation over the coming fiscal years is expected to be from OpenAI.\nFor this to happen, we need to assume that OpenAI has the money ready and that Oracle can finish its data centers in time. The first one is unthinkable, since OpenAI is falling behind other AI competitors and expects to be deep in the red until at least 2029. The latter argument is already crumbling, with Oracle delaying \"some\" data center projects for OpenAI to 2028.\nWhat you're actually betting on, and why I wouldn't take the bet Buying Oracle stock is now essentially a bet on OpenAI and its commitments. I do not believe that OpenAI will be able to buy $300 billion worth of compute over the agreement period. OpenAI won't be on the hook and can cancel or downsize the agreement, with Oracle's shareholders taking most of the blow.\n\nWeather, extreme demand, and finicky data center funding will inevitably push deadlines, too.\nIf you do want to bet on AI and data centers, you're better off buying Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , or Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) instead. They aren't as dependent on RPO figures from one startup.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Adobe Stock Rides on Expanding Partner Base: Is There More Upside?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:40 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADBE\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAdobe ’s ADBE prospects are expected to benefit from an expanding partner base that includes the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Copilot, Google Gemini, HUMAIN, OpenAI and others. ADBE’s Firefly, Express and Creative Cloud applications currently integrate models from partners, including Google, OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, Luma, Runway, Topaz Labs and Eleven Labs.\n\nAdobe’s launch of Premiere Mobile in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 strengthened its footprint as a leading provider of next-generation AI video editing. The company announced a partnership with Google and YouTube, which is helping creators receive Adobe Premiere’s video editing tools in a new content creation space called Create for YouTube Shorts at the Premiere mobile app. Expansion of ad network partnerships with Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Snap and TikTok is a key catalyst for Adobe.\n\nThe company has recently entered into a strategic partnership with Runaway, where ADBE will utilize Runaway’s video technology, along with its own creative tools, to develop the next generation of video workflows. Adobe will be Runaway’s preferred API creativity partner, which will help ADBE’s customers get access to Runaway’s latest models. Its latest models, including Runaway’s new GEN-4.5, which are available only in Adobe Firefly, will be available to all ADBE’s clients.\n\nApart from an expanding partner base, Adobe’s strategy of infusing AI into its portfolio is driving growth, as reflected by the fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. Adobe exited the year with annual recurring revenues (ARR) of $25.2 billion, indicating 11.5% year-over-year growth, and management expects it to continue to rise to $25.6 at the end of fiscal 2026.

      "Content": "3 Tech ETFs To Load Up on Before 2026\n\nVandita Jadeja\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:37 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IGV\n\nQQQ\n\nVGT\n\nVITAX\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Tech stocks reached new highs in 2025 driven by strong AI demand.\nIGV holds 115 software companies with 62% in its top 10 holdings including Microsoft and Palantir.\nVGT allocates 32% to semiconductors and returned 120.57% cumulatively over 3 years.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAs we come to the close of 2025, tech stocks are gaining pace, and they’ve remained one of the best performing in the industry. The stock market was driven higher by the strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI), which led tech stocks to new highs. While the year was beneficial for investors who held tech stocks, 2026 may not be a repeat. There are terrific tech companies, but there’s no guarantee that the sector will continue to thrive next year. This is where exchange-traded funds come into play.\nIf you do not want to risk owning specific tech stocks, you can consider investing in tech ETFs that give you the best of the industry. These ETFs are heavily tech-focused, have a low expense ratio, and hold companies that are backed by healthy fundamentals. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ( IGV ), Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF ( NYSE: VGT ), and Invesco QQQ Trust ( NASDAQ:QQQ ) are 3 ETFs to load up on before 2026.\n\niShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF tracks the performance of the index composed of North American equities in the software industry. The fund invests in a lot of high-quality companies that have shown strong revenue growth and solid margins.\nThe fund holds 115 stocks and has an expense ratio of 0.39%. While it is slightly on the higher side, IGV has a portfolio of the biggest tech giants. Its top 10 holdings include Microsoft Corporation, Palantir Technologies, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce, AppLovin, ServiceNow, and Adobe. It has the highest allocation in Palantir Technologies and Microsoft Corporation.\n\nThe top 10 holdings form 62% of the fund. Sector-wise, the fund invests heavily in application software (62.78%), followed by systems software (33.45%) and interactive home (2.82%).\nIGV is an investment in enterprise automation, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and AI productivity tools. With this ETF, you’re investing in the software segment of the industry. The fund has generated a total return of 28.64% in one year and 31.95% in 3 years. IGV gained 8.17% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $108.07. The software industry has lagged in 2025, and we could see a significant improvement in the coming year. IGV is an excellent way to buy the dip in the software industry.\n\nStory Continues\nVanguard Information Technology ETF If you think that the U.S. economy will continue to be driven by the tech sector, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF could be an ideal bet. It is exactly what a growth investor is looking for. The fund focuses on a little over 300 companies and includes all the mega-cap names. VGT is focused on top-quality mega-cap tech giants that have shown impressive growth in 2025.\n\nIt has the highest allocation to the semiconductor industry at 32.10%, followed by systems software at 18.20% and hardware storage at 17.70%. The top 10 holdings of the fund include Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Oracle, and Broadcom. It has the highest allocation of 16.61% in Nvidia, followed by 15.31% in Apple. The fund has $130.0 billion in assets under management.\nVGT has an expense ratio of 0.09% and a yield of 0.38%. Since tech-focused ETFs are focused on a specific industry, they carry higher risk but also a high payoff. Looking at the tech sector today, VGT has a high return potential. The fund has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 120.57% and a 5-year return of 132.26%.\nThe fund has gained 23.13% so far in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $765.03.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust While the Invesco QQQ isn’t a pure-play tech ETF, it continues to remain tech heavy with over 64% allocation to the sector. It is a less risky alternative as compared to the other two funds mentioned here. The fund has $408 billion in assets under management. It has generated a cumulative 5-year return of 113% and a 10-year return of 486%. This is an unbelievable result and shows a double-digit return throughout the decade. QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index and holds 101 stocks.\n\nBesides the allocation in the tech sector, QQQ allocates 18.29% to the consumer discretionary segment, followed by 4.21% to the healthcare segment. Its top 10 holdings constitute about 50% of the fund and include Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft Corporation, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. It has an expense ratio of 0.18%.\nThe ETF has gained 21.93% so far in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $622.11. This ETF is home to some of the biggest and the best U.S. tech companies. Its top 10 holdings are all AI plays, and the fund has generated impressive returns this year. Since it holds 100 of the best tech stocks, there’s less diversification than the S&P 500, and it has outperformed the S&P 500.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "IREN's AI Client Base Expands: Is Growth Becoming More Durable?\n\nSubhasish Mukherjee\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:23 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: IREN\n\nMSFT\n\nIREN Limited ’s IREN expanding AI client base is increasingly pointing to a more durable growth profile, reducing reliance on any single anchor client. Beyond the highly visible $9.7 billion Microsoft AI cloud agreement, the company has added several multi-year AI cloud customers, including Together AI, Fluidstack and Fireworks AI. These wins are expected to contribute more than $500 million in AI Cloud ARR by early fiscal 2026, even before Microsoft-related revenues scale materially.\n\nThe impact of diversification is now evident in IREN’s operating metrics. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company posted a fifth straight quarter of record revenue, reaching $240 million, suggesting growth is becoming more consistent rather than event-driven. Management also pointed to pre-contracted GPU deployments at its Canadian facilities, a clear indicator of forward demand and improved revenue predictability across its AI customer base.\n\nIndustry dynamics are increasingly supportive of IREN’s positioning. AI compute demand is surging across hyperscalers, AI-native labs and enterprise users, while supply remains bottlenecked by limited power availability and data center readiness. In this situation, IREN’s vertically integrated platform, which controls power, land, data centers and GPU infrastructure, provides a clear edge, enabling faster customer onboarding and enhanced pricing leverage.\n\nLooking ahead, IREN’s roadmap to 140,000 GPUs by the end of 2026 underscores the depth of its long-term growth runway. This capacity positions IREN to pursue approximately $3.4 billion in total AI Cloud ARR by year-end 2026, spanning the Microsoft agreement, existing GPU capacity and new AI customer wins.\n\nHow IREN’s Rivals Are Broadening Their AI Client Base CoreWeave CRWV is one of the most aggressive AI cloud players, specializing in purpose-built GPU infrastructure for hyperscalers and AI labs. CoreWeave reported a $55.6 billion revenue backlog in the third quarter of 2025, up 271% year over year, driven by expanded contracts with customers such as OpenAI, Meta and multiple hyperscalers. Importantly, CoreWeave noted that nine of its ten largest customers now have multiple contracts, indicating the growing expansion and depth of the AI client base despite the risk of chronic concentration.\n\nTeraWulf WULF is expanding its AI footprint through a long-term joint venture with Fluidstack, positioning TeraWulf as a power- and infrastructure-focused HPC provider. The partnership targets high-density compute demand under long-duration contracts, with the JV valued at roughly $9.5 billion over 25 years. However, most of TeraWulf’s planned capacity additions of 250 to 500 MW annually are unlikely to be fully operational before 2026, which will limit near-term AI revenue growth compared to IREN's rapid ramp.\n\nStory Continues\nIREN’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of IREN have soared 292% in the past year, outperforming the broader Zacks Finance sector’s return of 18.2% and the Zacks Financial Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of 6.2%.\nIREN’s One-Year Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIREN shares are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of forward price/sales, IREN is trading at 6.18X compared with the industry’s 3.36X.\nIREN’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IREN’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at 79 cents per share, marking a sharp year-over-year improvement from just 4 cents. However, the fiscal 2027 earnings estimate of $1.00 per share indicates year-over-year growth of 27.63%. Remarkably, consensus estimates for fiscal 2026 have remained stable over the past 30 days, while projections for fiscal 2027 have surged nearly threefold during the same period.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIREN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The standout performers have been companies aggressively pivoting to AI.\n\nIREN (IREN) led with a massive +300% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled by major GPU cloud deals and Microsoft&#x27;s backing .\nCipher Mining (CIFR) followed strongly at +230%, expanding AI hosting partnerships specifically with Fluidstack .\nHut 8 (HUT) also soared, up around +139%, capped by its recent AI announcement : a $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease for 245 MW at its River Bend site in Louisiana.\nIn contrast, three of the four largest bitcoin holders among public miners underperformed the AI/HPC miners.\nMarathon Digital (MARA), the top BTC hodler among miners with 53,250 BTC, dropped -44% YTD. CleanSpark (CLSK) (13,011 BTC) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) (19,324 BTC) saw modest gains of 16% and 32% respectively, without aggressive AI diversification until much later in the year.\n\nCore Scientific (CORZ) stayed independent after shareholders rejected a $9 billion all-stock takeover bid from CoreWeave in October, betting on higher standalone value amid AI demand. Its shares are up just 9% year-to-date.\nBitdeer Technologies (BTDR), the biggest underperforming mining company in the sector, is down around 50%. The bulk of the losses came after its Q3 earnings announcement, when the company reported a larger-than-anticipated net loss and disclosed a delay to its ASIC chip, adding uncertainty around its AI expansion plans.\nThis year underscored a clear trend: miners repurposing sites for AI data centers which outperformed pure-play bitcoin operators.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Those shares are now worth almost $700M.\nAST SpaceMobile successfully deployed BlueBird 6 on Wednesday. It is the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit.\nPlanet Labs ( PL ) reported record revenue of $81.3M in fiscal Q3. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672M.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAlphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) dominates the search engine market with over 90% share and powers billions of daily queries through Google Search. Its Google Cloud division has gained market share from leaders Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nA lesser-known aspect is Alphabet also directly invests in public companies through its venture arms GV and CapitalG. This portfolio held 38 stocks at the end of the third quarter with assets under management of about $2.5 billion and spanning sectors like healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI), and technology.\nYet there is one sector where Alphabet has placed its biggest bets: space. According to McKinsey, the space sector is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, so it's not surprising Alphabet is attempting to cash in on the explosive growth expected. What's notable about Alphabet's space investments is that it has concentrated its focus on just two stocks, which comprise 45% of the portfolio's AUM at current valuations.\n\nAST SpaceMobile ( NASDAQ:ASTS ) and Planet Labs ( NYSE:PL ) stand out as the largest positions in the portfolio, so let's see whether they warrant an investment from you, too.\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) AST SpaceMobile builds a space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by standard smartphones. Alphabet participated in a $155 million strategic investment round in early 2024 alongside AT&T ( NYSE:T ) and Vodafone ( NASDAQ:VOD ), supporting the company's satellite constellation development.\n\nGoogle collaborates on product development, testing, and implementation for network connectivity on Android devices. In the first quarter of 2025, Alphabet added 8.9 million shares valued at approximately $203 million. Today, those shares are worth almost $700 million and represent the portfolio's largest holding, or 23.3% of the total.\nAST achieved a key milestone on Wednesday with the successful launch and orbital deployment of BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit. This validates its technology for direct-to-device connectivity.\n\nStory Continues\nThe satellite stock's shares have surged 270% year-to-date as it advances its launch schedule and partnerships with over 50 mobile network operators serving billions of subscribers. The stock has been volatile, but has gained significant ground as it attained new milestones.\nAST SpaceMobile's focus on eliminating connectivity gaps aligns with the growth in satellite broadband, but analysts still give it mixed reviews. Some rate it a Buy for its long-term potential, while others are concerned about execution risks, limited revenue, and ongoing losses. Weiss Ratings , for example, just reiterated its Sell rating on the stock while Barclays downgraded it in October from Overweight to Underweight.\n\nAST SpaceMobile is probably best suited for risk-tolerant investors who may see an opportunity in it capturing even a slice of the projected $100 billion satellite broadband market.\nPlanet Labs (PL) Planet Labs operates a fleet of over 200 satellites providing daily global imagery and geospatial data for sectors including agriculture, defense, finance, and climate monitoring. Alphabet holds a roughly 10% stake, with data integrations supporting Google Earth and AI models for environmental analytics.\n\nAlphabet's position in Planet Labs is currently valued at approximately $650 million after the stock jumped following its fiscal year 2026 Q3 earnings report, making it the portfolio's second-largest holding. The valuation is 56% above where it stood on the date of Alphabet's 13F-HR filing.\nPlanet Labs reported record quarterly revenue of $81.3 million, up 33% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672 million, driven by defense and intelligence contracts.\nThe space stock's shares have rocketed over 400% in 2025 following hefty earnings beats and analyst upgrades. Morgan Stanley hiked its price target from $4.50 to $20 per share, which suggests Planet Labs is fairly priced, but the consensus has a sub-$15 target, which is why the stock has a Hold rating overall.\n\nIn the expanding $1.8 trillion space economy by 2035, Planet Labs benefits from geospatial AI applications that should contribute to revenue growth outpacing the sector. Aggressive investors may view it as a thematic play, but most investors should probably wait for a more attractive entry point following its huge run-up.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Analysts See Triple-Digit Revenue Growth in 2026 for These 3 AI Infrastructure Stocks\n\nRich Duprey\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:43 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nCRWV\n\nIREN\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Nebius Group ( NBIS ) targets $7B to $9B in annualized revenue by end of 2026. This implies potential growth of 521% to 900%.\nIren ( IREN ) landed a five-year $9.7B contract with Microsoft for GPU cloud services at 85% EBITDA margins.\nCoreWeave (CRWV) has secured long-term contracts with major hyperscalers, but is dogged by concerns over its ballooning debt.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nArtificial intelligence is driving explosive demand for computing power as companies invest heavily to develop and deploy AI models. This has created opportunities in AI infrastructure, including specialized cloud platforms and data centers.\nWall Street forecasts three stocks in particular are uniquely positioned to significantly benefit from benefit the massive expansion and adoption of AI: Nebius Group ( NASDAQ:NBIS ), IREN ( NASDAQ:IREN ) and CoreWeave ( NASDAQ:CRWV ) are projected to witness revenue growth rates for 2026 ranging from over 135% to 521%, a torrid pace of growth.\nAs stock prices tend to follow earnings growth based on increased sales, even if analysts are only partially right, investors in these three companies could see a substantially higher repricing of their stocks.\n\nNebius Group (NBIS) Nebius Group provides full-stack AI infrastructure, including large-scale GPU clusters and cloud platforms for AI developers. The company has set ambitious targets, aiming for annualized run rate (ARR) in revenue of $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of 2025 and $7 billion to $9 billion by the end of 2026. This implies potential revenue growth of as much as 1,600%.\n\nWall Street views this growth as driven by strong demand for AI compute, with Nebius securing major contracts, including a multi-year deal with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) valued at over $19 billion and a $3 billion partnership with Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) over five years. The company is expanding capacity to 800 megawatts (MW) to 1 gigawatt (GW) of connected power by the end of 2026, with contracted power reaching 2.5 GW.\nThe likelihood of achieving the upper end depends on the timely execution of capacity buildouts during a period of supply constraints in power and hardware. Delays could push revenue recognition, but sold-out capacity and hyperscaler backing provide Nebius with significant visibility. If it meets its targets, this could drive substantial stock appreciation, given its current $23 billion market cap and high-growth multiple in AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nIREN (IREN) Iris Energy owns and operates renewable-powered data centers, originally focused on Bitcoin mining but rapidly expanding into AI cloud services and high-performance computing. The company has secured a five-year, $9.7 billion contract with Microsoft for GPU cloud services, announced in November 2025, expected to generate approximately $1.94 billion in annual recurring revenue at 85% EBITDA margins once fully deployed.\n\nManagement targets $3.4 billion in annualized run-rate revenue from AI cloud services by the end of 2026 -- a greater-than 500% increase -- supported by plans to scale its GPU fleet from approximately 23,000 units to 140,000 units.\nWall Street analysts, however, while maintaining a generally positive outlook with a consensus \"Moderate Buy\" rating and average price targets around $70 to $85, see revenue growing more conservatively, projecting rates in the range of 100% 200% from 2025. Achieving the full run-rate depends on timely GPU procurement, data center buildouts, and sustained demand, while overcoming risks including high capital expenditure needs and potential deployment delays.\nIf IREN realizes revenue closer to guidance, this could lead to upward revisions in estimates and a significant stock revaluation toward higher infrastructure multiples.\n\nCoreWeave (CRWV) CoreWeave offers a purpose-built cloud platform for AI workloads, with GPU compute and managed services. The company reported strong demand, with a revenue backlog exceeding $55 billion. Guidance for 2025 revenue is $5.05 billion to $5.15 billion, while analysts project average 2026 revenue of $12.01 billion, representing growth of around 134% to 138%.\n\nThe growth projections are supported by long-term contracts with customers like OpenAI , Microsoft, and Meta, including expansions worth billions. Capacity is expanding rapidly, though recent delays from third-party partners shifted some 2025 revenue into 2026.\nWall Street rates it positively overall, citing ties to Nvidia 's ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) ecosystem and high margins, but more recently, CoreWeave's heavy debt and execution on massive capex (expected to more than double in 2026) have weighed on the stock.\nIf demand is able to sustain the projected levels and buildouts proceed as planned, the backlog supports CoreWeave's accelerated growth, potentially leading to stock gains as multiples compress on higher revenue. Investors, though, should proceed cautiously and wait for a better buy-in price.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "MSFT vs. ORCL: Which Enterprise Cloud & AI Stock Has Better Upside?\n\nVasundhara Sawalka\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:27 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nORCL\n\nMicrosoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL have emerged as two dominant players capitalizing on the enterprise cloud and artificial intelligence revolution. Both companies are investing billions in AI infrastructure to meet unprecedented demand from hyperscalers and enterprise clients. Microsoft, with its Azure cloud platform and OpenAI partnership, has transformed into an AI-first enterprise software giant. Oracle has pivoted from its database legacy to become a formidable cloud infrastructure provider, securing massive multi-year contracts with AI pioneers.\n\nBoth technology titans reported strong fiscal results in their latest quarters, with Microsoft delivering 18% revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and Oracle posting 14% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2026. The companies share similar growth drivers — surging cloud adoption, AI workload expansion, and massive capital expenditure programs to build datacenter capacity. Yet their financial profiles, strategic positioning, and execution risks differ significantly.\n\nLet's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.\n\nThe Case for MSFT Stock Microsoft's diversified AI ecosystem positions the company for sustained growth across multiple revenue streams. The company's first-quarter fiscal 2026 results demonstrated robust momentum with Microsoft Cloud revenues surpassing $49 billion, up 26% year over year. Azure and other cloud services grew approximately 40%, driven by both traditional cloud migrations and expanding AI workloads. The company's commercial remaining performance obligations reached nearly $400 billion, up more than 50%, providing exceptional revenue visibility.\n\nIn December 2025, Microsoft announced $23 billion in new AI investments, including $17.5 billion in India — its largest investment in Asia — and $5.4 billion in Canada over the next few years. These geographic expansions demonstrate Microsoft's commitment to building sovereign cloud capacity and meeting global AI demand. The company also launched Microsoft 365 Copilot Business at $21 per user per month for small and mid-sized businesses, broadening AI adoption beyond Fortune 500 enterprises.\n\nMicrosoft's partnership with Cognizant, announced in December, extends its healthcare, retail, financial services, and manufacturing AI capabilities through agentic AI and Copilot integration. The company also announced Microsoft 365 pricing increases effective July 2026, reflecting pricing power and confidence in its value proposition. With operating income up 22% in the first quarter and adjusted earnings per share reaching $4.13, Microsoft maintains strong profitability despite heavy AI infrastructure investments.\n\nManagement's second-quarter fiscal 2026 guidance projects Intelligent Cloud revenues of $32.25 billion to $32.55 billion with 26-27% growth. While Microsoft acknowledged capacity constraints through at least fiscal year-end 2026, the company's $34.9 billion in first-quarter capital expenditures addresses this challenge. The diversified business model spanning productivity software, cloud infrastructure, gaming, and LinkedIn provides multiple growth engines and cushions against any single segment weakness.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $15.61 per share, up 0.1% over the past 30 days. The estimate indicates 14.44% year-over-year growth.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\nThe Case for ORCL Stock Oracle delivered impressive cloud infrastructure growth of 68% in second-quarter fiscal 2026, with total cloud revenues reaching $8 billion, up 34% year over year. The company's remaining performance obligations surged to $523 billion, up 438% year over year, driven by massive contracts from Meta, NVIDIA, and OpenAI. This unprecedented backlog provides multi-year revenue visibility, with management projecting an additional $4 billion in fiscal 2027 revenues from faster RPO conversion.\n\nOracle's multicloud strategy gained traction in December 2025 with expanded Oracle Database@Google Cloud availability in India and other regions. The company has built more than 211 live and planned cloud regions globally and is halfway through embedding 72 Oracle Multicloud datacenters within Amazon, Google, and Microsoft clouds. The multicloud database business surged 817% in the second quarter, representing Oracle's fastest-growing segment.\n\nDecember brought significant strategic developments, including Michigan regulators approving Oracle's 1-gigawatt data center with OpenAI, and the company securing a controlling interest in TikTok's U.S. operations through a joint venture. These wins position Oracle as a critical cloud and security infrastructure provider for major platforms. However, financing challenges emerged when Blue Owl Capital withdrew from backing the $10 billion Michigan project, forcing Oracle to explore alternative funding structures.\n\nOracle's elevated capital expenditure trajectory raises concerns. The company now expects approximately $50 billion in fiscal 2026 capex, up from $35 billion projected in September. Free cash flow turned negative $10 billion in the second quarter as infrastructure spending accelerated. Management maintains commitment to investment-grade debt ratings but acknowledged exploring customer-funded equipment purchases and supplier chip leasing to reduce financing needs. Software revenues declined 3%, highlighting Oracle's transition challenges from legacy licensing to cloud subscriptions. For third-quarter fiscal 2026, Oracle guided to 16-18% total revenue growth and 12-14% non-GAAP EPS growth, solid but moderating from recent quarters.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $7.33 per share, marking an upward revision of 7.6% over the past 30 days. The earnings figure suggests 21.56% growth over the figure reported in fiscal 2025.\n\nOracle Corporation Price and Consensus Oracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation Quote\nValuation and Price Performance Comparison Microsoft trades at 28.8x forward earnings while Oracle trades at 25.38x forward earnings. Both stocks command premium valuations reflecting AI growth expectations. Microsoft's price-to-earnings ratio, while elevated, is supported by consistent double-digit revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and a multi-year AI monetization runway across productivity, infrastructure, and applications. Oracle's lower multiple reflects execution uncertainty around converting its massive backlog into profitable revenues while managing unprecedented capex without compromising financial flexibility.\n\nMSFT vs. ORCL: P/E F12M Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft's shares lost 5.2% in the past three-month period, outperforming Oracle, which has experienced significant volatility, plunging 30.2% in the same time frame due to financing concerns.\nMSFT Outperforms ORCL in 3 Months\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion Microsoft emerges as the superior choice for investors seeking enterprise cloud and AI exposure. The company's diversified business model reduces concentration risk while its Azure platform benefits from both cloud migration and AI workload expansion. Microsoft's proven ability to monetize AI through Copilot adoption, strong pricing power evidenced by upcoming Microsoft 365 increases, and geographic expansion in India and Canada position it for sustained growth. While Oracle offers compelling cloud infrastructure growth, the company faces significant challenges around financing $50 billion in capex, converting its massive backlog efficiently, and managing customer concentration risks with OpenAI. Investors should watch Microsoft stock for attractive entry points given its 14% pullback from highs, while holding Oracle stock or waiting for better entry points until the company demonstrates improved capital efficiency and reduced financing uncertainty. Microsoft and Oracle carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each at present.

      "Content": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\n\nNalak Das\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:38 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of the three above-mentioned stocks year to date.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon.com Inc. Global e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN’s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon’s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is “Growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\n\nExtensive AI Applications Amazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called “Project Rainier.” This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\n\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers’ queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN’s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance Amazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft Corp. Microsoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT’s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company’s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT’s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength Microsoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN’s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT’s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\n\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc. The undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\n\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company’s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions Zacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nORCL\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) gained 1.96% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.03% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 16.59%, including a nearly 38% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, 2025, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $631.36, which represents 29.37% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n2.45%\nMedian\n$631.36\n29.37%\nHigh\n$700\n43.43%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 15.49% from the stock's current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "From Gates to Musk: Net Worth of Richest American from 1995 to 2025\n\nTravis Woods\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:10 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMSFT\n\nRecently, Tesla CEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk became the first person to gain a net worth over $400 billion, having added $184 billion to his preexisting wealth thanks to a 56% boost in Tesla stock. That extraordinary leap in wealth has also made Musk the wealthiest American citizen (in addition to the richest person on Earth) for the fourth year in a row.\n\nWhile Musk’s total net worth of over $750 billion certainly makes him the richest American, there was a time when a mere $15 billion would have been the highest net worth in the country. Specifically, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ net worth of $15 billion made him wealthiest American back in 1995. That stunning disparity between 1995 and 2025 highlights the massive consolidation of wealth that has occurred at society’s highest levels, in which the 20 richest Americans have collectively amassed $3 trillion.\nBy tracing the arc of the richest Americans over the last 30 years, you can watch as the country’s wealth accumulates and increases around a very small group of individuals — three tech-driven entrepreneurs whose companies have helped reshape American society just as they have collected most of the country’s wealth. Those three men are, per Forbes : Gates, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk. Their accretion of wealth has leapt from $15 billion to a shocking $751.9 billion (as of Dec. 24), and that number is only expected to increase as Musk is on track to becoming America’s — and the world’s — first trillionaire .\n1995: Bill Gates Net worth : $15 billion\nFind Out: If the Top 10 Billionaires’ Wealth Was Distributed Equally in America, How Much Money Would Each Person Get?\nRead Next: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n1996: Bill Gates Net worth : $18.5 billion\nFor You: 6 Money Moves Wealthy People Always Make Before New Year’s\n1997: Bill Gates Net worth : $40 billion\n1998: Bill Gates Net worth : $58 billion\n1999: Bill Gates Net worth : $85 billion\n2000: Bill Gates Net worth : $63 billion\nCheck Out: 5 Key Mindset Shifts To Financially Become the Top 1%, According to Humphrey Yang\n2001: Bill Gates Net worth : $54 billion\n2002: Bill Gates Net worth : $43 billion\n2003: Bill Gates Net worth : $46 billion\n2004: Bill Gates Net worth : $48 billion\nDiscover More: If Mark Zuckerberg’s Wealth Were Evenly Distributed Across America, How Much Money Would Every Person Get?\n2005: Bill Gates Net worth : $51 billion\n2006: Bill Gates Net worth : $56 billion\n2007: Bill Gates Net worth : $59 billion\n2008: Bill Gates Net worth : $57 billion\nBe Aware: What Class Do You Actually Belong To?

Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.
