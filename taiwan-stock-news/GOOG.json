He said these innovations had taken decades to be widely adopted, adding that he expected the same with Bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin is a technological invention to advance money,” he said. “Change takes a moment – time validates great innovations.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nCardone’s remarks come as 2025 has challenged Bitcoin’s “digital gold” and bull market thesis.\nWhile Bitcoin did surge to a new record price of $126,000 this year, it has since shed most of those gains to most recently trade around $88,000, down 11% in 2025 on the back of tariff panic and jitters around tech stocks .\nCardone turned pro-Bitcoin over the past year, touting the digital asset as a store of value.

      "Content": "Missed Out on Investing in Palantir? 1 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy Before It Soars in 2026.\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 5:52 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Alphabet is one of the best ways to capitalize on the AI revolution, considering its diversified approach to the technology.\nAlphabet's growth could accelerate remarkably due to AI, and its valuation is still at an attractive level for new buyers.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) stock is coming off another remarkable year. Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) software specialist shot up by 143% in 2025, outperforming the broader market by a huge margin.\n\nIt is worth noting that Palantir stock has jumped by 2,800% over the past three years. However, the broader sentiment on Wall Street suggests that the stock may have gotten ahead of itself. Though the company's growth is accelerating at a solid pace and it has a big enough revenue pipeline to maintain its momentum, the stock's lofty valuation is a point of concern.\nThe company will have to continue outperforming expectations by wide margins to eventually justify its current sales multiple of 122 and earnings multiple of 435. So, if you missed out on Palantir's stunning surge and are wary of buying it now because of its valuation, you might instead want to take a closer look at another company that has the potential to win big from the proliferation of AI in 2026 and beyond -- Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nThe market may be underrating Alphabet's AI-fueled growth potential Alphabet's stock gains over the past three years have been nowhere close to Palantir's. It rose by 253% during this period, which is not surprising, given that the company initially fell behind its rivals in the AI race. However, its AI credentials have received some big boosts lately.\nAlphabet may have stumbled initially, but its steady approach to the new tech is reaping dividends. This is evident from data provided by web analytics platform Similarweb, which points out that Alphabet's Google Gemini chatbot now controls 18% of generative AI web traffic, more than triple its share from the year-ago period.\n\nThe generative AI assistant has made that impressive growth at the expense of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has seen its market share slide by 19 percentage points from 87% to 68%. Alphabet's growing share of this space isn't surprising. The company has integrated Gemini across different applications, including its Chrome browser, its Android smartphone operating system, its Google Search engine, and the Google Workplace productivity tools.\nThe company has been monetizing Gemini by offering various subscription tiers that enable users to deploy the AI assistant for generating images, creating videos, carrying out research and writing tasks, and utilizing Gemini in Gmail, Docs, and other applications. Given that Gemini is a consumer-facing app that helps users boost productivity, it could eventually allow Alphabet to make a bigger dent in the AI software market.\n\nStory Continues\nABI Research estimates that the AI software market could grow from $122 billion in 2024 to $467 billion in 2030. Alphabet, therefore, seems poised to capitalize on a massive opportunity that could help accelerate its long-term growth. Research firm Pivotal Research estimates that Gemini's prospects could send Alphabet stock to $400, which would be a jump of 27% from current levels. However, the long-term opportunities in AI software and other AI-related catalysts that Alphabet is sitting on could help it easily surpass that mark.\n\nThis move could supercharge Alphabet's growth There are reports that Alphabet is considering selling some of its Tensor Processing Units (TPU) -- the custom AI chips that it developed in-house -- to third parties. AI company Anthropic said in October that it plans \"to expand our use of Google Cloud technologies, including up to one million TPUs, dramatically increasing our compute resources as we continue to push the boundaries of AI research and product development.\"\n\nAnthropic added that it will spend \"tens of billions of dollars\" on this expansion, bringing more than 1 gigawatt of AI computing capacity online in 2026. This news was followed by a report in November that Meta Platforms is looking to spend billions of dollars purchasing Alphabet's TPUs. Thus far, Alphabet has only deployed TPUs in its own cloud servers.\nAnalyst Gil Luria of financial services company D.A. Davidson says that if Alphabet decides to sell its TPUs to third parties, it could corner a fifth of the AI chip market in the long run. That could translate into a $900 billion revenue opportunity for the company.\nGiven that Alphabet has generated just over $385 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months, the potential opportunities discussed above indicate that it can significantly increase its top line in the long run. Throw in the terrific growth of its Google Cloud business and the huge backlog in this segment, and it is easy to see why analysts have become bullish about Alphabet's prospects.\nAs such, there is a good chance that Alphabet stock will sustain its newly found momentum in 2026. The stock has jumped by more than 76% in the past six months, and it can still be bought at an attractive 10 times sales and 28 times forward earnings -- multiples that are significantly cheaper than Palantir's. However, Alphabet may not trade at such attractive valuations for long. It could soon be rewarded with richer multiples because of its accelerating growth, en route to further upside in this AI stock in 2026 and beyond.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "3 Phenomenal Stocks That Could Double in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMELI\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nebius expects rapid growth in 2026.\nThe Trade Desk trades at a deep discount to the market.\nMercadoLibre is down 20% from its all-time high.\n10 stocks we like better than Nebius Group ›\nPinpointing stocks that could double faster than the market is a great skill to have; the broader market usually takes about seven years to double, assuming an average 10% annual return. Finding stocks that can double in a year or less is very difficult, and there's usually a bit of luck involved.\nHowever, I've identified three stocks that could achieve this through growth or multiple expansion, and each looks like an intriguing buy in the new year.\n1. Nebius Nebius (NASDAQ: NBIS) was spun out of Yandex, which is essentially the Russian equivalent of Google. After sanctions came down amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Yandex decided to spin out its Russian and non-Russian businesses, and Nebius was formed. However, Nebius doesn't bear any resemblance to the search engine part of the business, but it is similar to Google Cloud, its cloud computing wing.\n\nNebius is focused on building out its data center footprint, both by building its own data centers and leasing space from others that have floor space. Then, it installs its computing units -- mostly graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- in these locations and rents out the computing capacity to its artificial intelligence (AI) customers to train or run workloads on.\nWith the huge demand for AI computing power, it should come as no surprise that Nebius expects monster growth in 2026. Although the stock tripled in 2025, don't be surprised to see it double again in 2026. Nebius expects an annual run rate (ARR) of $7 billion to $9 billion in revenue for 2026. For reference, Nebius' current ARR is $551 million.\nThat's unbelievable growth in a quick timeframe, and could be what the stock needs to double again in 2026.\n\n2. The Trade Desk The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is on the opposite end of the spectrum from Nebius. Its growth is shrinking, rather than accelerating. In Q3, The Trade Desk posted its slowest quarter of growth ever (outside of a single COVID-affected quarter).\nThe Trade Desk operates a buy-side ad platform, which helps companies looking to advertise their products find the optimal location to place their ad. This industry is still growing, especially with the rise of connected TV. While The Trade Desk has had a few missteps along the way, it's still a promising business. It could accelerate its growth again in 2026, especially without the year-over-year comparison headwind of political spending that occurred in 2024 versus 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nThanks to the market's loss of confidence in The Trade Desk, the stock trades for an attractive 18 times forward earnings. That's a steal for a solid business like The Trade Desk, and a return to growth plus a valuation increase could easily cause the stock to double in 2026.\n3. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) has built an incredible business in Latin America. It has the dominant e-commerce platform in the region, which offers many of the benefits that we enjoy as online shoppers in the U.S., such as same-day or next-day delivery. It also built its own fintech division to handle payments because access to digital spending technology isn't as prevalent in Latin America as in the U.S.\nMercadoLibre's growth has been nothing short of incredible, and it continues to pump out quarter after quarter of rapid growth.\nDespite this record, MercadoLibre's stock is down about 20% from its all-time high and is expected to have another solid year in 2026. An average of 25 Wall Street analysts project MercadoLibre will deliver 29% revenue growth in 2026. MercadoLibre also consistently outperforms expectations, so a higher growth rate than this wouldn't surprise me, either.\n\nThrough a combination of MercadoLibre setting new all-time highs and the growth being priced into the stock once it occurs, I think there's a high chance MercadoLibre could double in 2026. However, it's far from a surefire bet. Still, I think MercadoLibre is a great pick for 2026, regardless of whether it doubles.\nShould you buy stock in Nebius Group right now?

EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nAckman's proposal centers on a pragmatic, three-step “walk before you run” strategy designed to stabilize the housing market while delivering a massive windfall to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe Three-Part Plan Repayment Acknowledgment: Ackman argues the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA should formally acknowledge that the GSEs have fully repaid their initial $190 billion bailout. To date, they have returned over $300 billion in profits to the government.\nExercise Warrants: The government holds warrants for a 79.9% stake in both companies. Ackman proposes that the Treasury exercise these immediately, formalizing taxpayer ownership and creating a mark-to-market windfall he estimates at over $300 billion.\nNYSE Relisting: Moving the stocks from the over-the-counter (OTC) market back to the New York Stock Exchange would provide the liquidity necessary for institutional investors to build positions.\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nThe 2026 Catalyst Ackman believes 2026 is the pivotal year for this “asymmetric” trade.\nBy relisting the entities, the Trump administration gains a three-year runway to finalize capital requirements and management structures.\nAckman projects that if Fannie and Freddie trade at 16x and 13x their estimated 2026 earnings, respectively, the shares could see an upside of 300% to 400%.\n\n\"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry shared a similar thesis in early December in which he suggested the government is preparing to re-privatize the giants via a massive IPO, potentially valuing them at $500 billion by 2026.\nSee Also: Jeff Bezos-Backed Arrived Homes Hits A Big Sale On Charlotte Property – Investors Earning A 34.7% Return\nBurry also described the Trump administration as eager to \"get Big Homebuilders going\" and stimulate the housing market.\n\nStory Continues\nAckman sees this as more than just a trade; it is a way to remove roughly $8 trillion in liabilities from the government’s balance sheet while ensuring the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage remains the bedrock of American homeownership.\nBy granting Fannie and Freddie their freedom from federal conservatorship, Ackman argues the government can finally turn a crisis-era burden into one of the greatest taxpayer success stories in financial history.\n\nRead Next: Missed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs?

      "Content": "2026 will be the year of the robotaxi\n\nHamza Shaban · Senior Reporter\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nUBER\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nThis is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nWhere the great transformation from gas-powered cars to EVs has hit some serious roadblocks , the push into robotaxis continues to gain momentum.\n\nTesla, again on the downswing for its vehicle deliveries , is on the upswing, aiming to overhaul ride-hailing like it did the auto industry.\nUber is wheeling and dealing , touting more than a dozen partnerships, with plans to operate robotaxi services in 10 markets by the end of 2026.\nAlphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Waymo is seeking new funding at a valuation of at least $100 billion . And other players like Amazon's Zoox have launched early rider programs before a making a bigger splash in the nascent market.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nSimilar to AI, the robotaxi market has a certain Wild West appeal. Startups and legacy names are scrambling to claim turf even as the revenue model, regulatory environment, and consumer appetite remains uncertain.\nCompanies are convinced people yearn for a self-driving future with less traffic, fewer crashes from human error, and the ability to do something else while behind the wheel.\nOn top of that, robotaxis attempt to solve an economic pothole tied to car ownership. People only use their vehicles for a fraction of the time they own them. It's hard enough knowing that our increasingly unaffordable $50,000 machines shed value from the second we buy them.\n\nPlus, they just sit there. Why not replace the concept of relying on a mostly unused but crucial depreciating asset for a no-strings-attached, on-demand substitute?\nAt some point, perhaps this year, we'll find out whether people actually want this future as much as the companies think.\nTempering consumer enthusiasm is the flip side of that Wild West appeal. Fender benders, crashes, recalls, weird incidents, and other embarrassing bumps on the road to a full self-driving destination.\nOn the weekend before Christmas, a widespread power outage in San Francisco took traffic lights across the city offline. Human drivers had to navigate the mess using their judgment, but autonomous vehicles, specifically Waymo's vehicles, halted in the middle of roadways . Videos circulating on social media showed the vehicles blocking traffic at intersections with their hazard lights blinking.\nAfter the San Francisco mayor's office contacted the company about the AI-fueled gridlock, Waymo suspended the ride-hailing service in the area before resuming operations the following day. While there were no accidents or injuries reported from the outages, a different kind of damage had been done.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla CEO Elon Musk posted on his platform X , saying, \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage,\" comparing the operations of his own Robotaxi service with the Waymo's snafu.\nBut Musk is a stone thrower living in a glass house. California is threatening to ban sales of Tesla vehicles after a judge found the company had engaged in deceptive marketing around its full self-driving (FSD) and autopilot systems, falsely implying they were fully automated.\n\nAnd while Musk appeared to be gloating after Waymo's mishap, skeptical analysts, like CFRA's Garrett Nelson, say his ambition for an autonomous fleet is weighed down by a record of overpromising and missed timelines.\nBut investors are buying into robotaxi dreams as if anything can happen.\nDan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, included in his top 10 predictions for 2026 a scenario supporting a Tesla bull case.\n\"Tesla will successfully launch Robotaxis in over 30 cities in 2026 and start to scale volume production of Cybercabs starting the true autonomous era for Musk & Co.\" he said in a note before the Christmas holiday. Tesla's stock, he added, could rise to $800, representing a roughly 60% climb from late December levels.\nNext year will be when the AI rubber meets the road.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

      "Content": "Is Reddit the new homepage for the Open Web?\n\nVahid Karaahmetovic\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 1:35 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: RDDT\n\nGOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Reddit is increasingly positioned as a key beneficiary of the shift from traditional search toward AI-generated answers, according to a recent analysis by brokerage Needham.\nAs search queries are replaced by AI answers, economic value is moving away from links and toward the sources cited by large language models (LLMs).\n\nIn that context, Needham analyst Laura Martin says Reddit is emerging as “the new homepage for the Open Internet,” given its outsized presence in AI citations and growing role in consumer discovery.\nThe core change that Martin highlights is the move from link-based search results to AI answers that summarize information directly.\nAs AI answers – responses generated directly by LLMs such as ChatGPT and Google’s AI Overviews – replace links, overall referral traffic declines, but the value shifts to the sources cited within those responses.\nThe analyst points to multiple studies suggesting Reddit accounts for a disproportionate share of those citations, consistently representing between 20% and 40% of sources referenced by AI-generated answers.\n“As AI-Answers replace links, economic benefits shift to the citations that AI-Answers give, and 20%-40% of citations are to Reddit,” Martin said.\n\nThis citation dominance is supported by several third-party studies cited in the note. A July 2025 Pew study found a meaningful gap in click behavior between searches with and without AI summaries, reinforcing the idea that reduced clicks increase the importance of citation ownership.\nA large-scale Semrush study published in the fourth quarter of 2025 analyzed 230,000 prompts across major AI platforms and found that Reddit appeared in roughly 40% of AI-generated responses.\nBy comparison, Wikipedia and YouTube trailed with citation rates of 26.3% and 23.5%, respectively.\nIronically, Semrush said that AI models favor Reddit because it offers “real, human responses, from users with experience in related fields.”\nMartin also points out similar findings from Axios and Similarweb. Axios data showed Reddit was a top-cited platform across all major language models, while Similarweb observed rising “zero-click” behavior as Google’s AI overviews expanded, alongside heavy citation of Reddit.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Needham sees two key economic benefits for Reddit from this shift.\nThe first is data licensing, with the firm estimating more than $120 million per year in license fees from large language model providers, a figure it believes could double once ongoing litigation with other AI firms is resolved.\nThe second is advertising upside, as increased visibility through AI citations drives impressions and engagement.\n\nStory Continues\n“Bottom line, RDDT is disproportionately cited inside AI-Answers (up to 40% of citations) and citations are the new value driver for consumer discovery and navigation of the Open Internet,” Martin concluded.\nRelated articles\nIs Reddit the new homepage for the Open Web?\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Top Stocks to Buy With $50,000 for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 11:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is a key supplier in the AI buildout.\nAmazon's financial success largely depends on the performance of its cloud computing wing.\nAlphabet is emerging as a generative AI leader.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nIf you've got $50,000 that you're looking to invest during 2026, I've got a few stocks that you should consider. Even if you don't have that much to deploy, smaller investments in these three stocks would allow retail investors to benefit from where the market looks to be heading. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) all have strong chances to outperform in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of the high-end chips being deployed in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout. Without its foundry capabilities, we wouldn't have the AI tech that we know today.\nThe investment thesis for Taiwan Semiconductor is fairly simple: Over time, the world will use more chips and more advanced ones. The truth of that premise is fairly obvious if you look at the trends in the tech sector's spending forecasts.\n\nAll of the AI hyperscalers set new records on capital expenditures in 2025, and all of them have said they expect to break those capex records in 2026. This money is being used to purchase land, build data centers, and fill them with the cutting-edge computing hardware required to handle generative AI workloads. Because it is the world's largest third-party foundry operator, Taiwan Semiconductor is manufacturing a major share of the chips going into those data centers, and that hardware isn't cheap.\nEvery time a new data center is constructed, TSMC gets a slice of the spending. With the data center buildout expected to accelerate in 2026 and beyond, Taiwan Semiconductor makes for a strong investment.\nAmazon Amazon is one of those companies constructing data centers for its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the most popular cloud computing option. It's also a major client of Taiwan Semiconductor through some of the chips that it purchases.\nAWS provides 66% of Amazon's total operating profits, so as AWS goes, so goes Amazon.\n\nFortunately for Amazon shareholders, AWS grew revenue at a 20% clip during Q3 -- its fastest rate in several years. With AWS growing rapidly and established as a critical partner for many AI-focused businesses, I think Amazon will be a great stock to invest in during 2026.\nAlphabet Alphabet shares had an incredible 2025, rising by around 65%. That performance isn't likely to be repeated in 2026, as part of it came as the result of the stock starting the year undervalued due to a cluster of concerns.\n\nStory Continues\nNow, it's trading at 30 times forward earnings, a valuation in line with its peers. This means the bulk of Alphabet's stock performance from here will be driven by its business growth, which is trending upward. In Q3, Alphabet reported a strong performance across the board. Revenue rose 16% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 35%.\n\nEven Google Search, the most mature part of Alphabet's business, experienced revenue growth of 15%. This indicates how strong the advertising market is, and as long as that market stays healthy, I have no reason to doubt that Alphabet will be a profitable stock pick in 2026.\nFurthermore, Alphabet has emerged as a leader in the AI realm, thanks to its popular large language model, Gemini. If Alphabet can continue to push boundaries and innovate, it will have a unique cost advantage. Alphabet can afford to keep prices on its models low to beat the competition, which may allow it to become the dominant AI model over the long term. We won't have a clear answer about how that will play out anytime soon, but it's a trend to keep an eye on.\n\nThough it won't repeat 2025's performance in 2026, Alphabet still looks like one of the top stocks to buy right now.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

Ramsey said most of these people became wealthy by working hard, saving, investing, and improving their skills over time, and that it would be \"absurd\" to claim their money came from luck.\n\n\"It's the idea that a farmer who plants seed and gets a crop after watering it and doing all the weeding and making sure that the land is taken care of, versus the farmer who just stands back and looks at the dirt, is lucky when his harvest comes in,\" Ramsey said. \"It was just luck. It was just luck.\"\nRamsey said that sports stars like basketball player Michael Jordan and golfer Tiger Woods didn't reach the top because of luck.

On Wednesday, John Freeman , Co-Founder and Senior Analyst at Ravenswood Partners, highlighted the potential impact of Microsoft’s Azure on Google’s AI business, particularly in the context of the upcoming ChatGPT 6 and the Gemini 3. Johnson pointed out that Google’s traditional business model, which relies on providing links instead of giving direct answers, has been impacted by ChatGPT, and this shift could potentially cut into Google’s revenues.\n“Anything on the margin that clips it, I think would really…hurt the stock,” he stated.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nMissed Tesla?

He added that Microsoft’s Azure is not only the leading AI cloud provider but also has a strong influence on the developer community, which further strengthens its position in the AI market.\n\n“And you don’t have the downside risk of generative AI disruption. I mean, you’ve got Microsoft 365 and Windows. Those are not likely to be disrupted by AI anytime soon,” he added.\nCorey Johnson , chief market strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research , echoed Freeman’s opinion on Google and stated that what Google is doing with AI erodes the core offerings of its business of generating revenue through clicks.\n“Their business is at inherent risk because of the cannibalization of AI,” he stated.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAnalysts Divided Over Google’s Prospects The analysts’ observations align with recent developments in the AI space. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says Wall Street is underestimating Microsoft, arguing the company is getting \"no respect\" despite being positioned for significant AI-driven growth in 2026, with its cloud business seen as a key winner in strategic AI deployments.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is ramping up its cloud and AI expansion with billions in global infrastructure investments, including its largest-ever commitment in Canada.

He started out playing for the Orlando Magic and spent the majority of his career with the Los Angeles Lakers, leading to three consecutive national championship rings. In total, he won four, per StatMuse.\nHe retired in 2011 with $286.3 million in career earnings, with $30 million earned annually at his peak, according to Entrepreneur.\n\nBusiness Moves After The League O’Neal’s earnings have only soared after his exit from the league through a slew of strategic decisions that have paid off, including serving as the second-largest shareholder of Authentic Brand Group; having his own investment portfolio, which includes Google; accumulating endorsement deals such as with The General and The Hershey Co.; and a business empire with an affordable shoe line that has sold more than 470 million pairs of shoes.\n\nBig Chicken Shaq also has an impressive restaurant portfolio that once included 155 Five Guys restaurants and 17 Auntie Anne’s Pretzels locations, and currently nine Papa John’s in Atlanta and one Krispy Kreme, Entrepreneur mentioned.\nIn 2018, Big Chicken was added to the mix. It is a fast-casual chicken chain that has become one of the fastest-growing franchises in the U.S., thanks to more than 350 locations in development, as\nAFROTECH\npreviously reported. The chain can be found in Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, Maryland, and, most recently, in Canada.\n\nBig Chicken is also on the brink of finalizing a $10 million capital raise led by Branded Hospitality Ventures that will support international expansion, according to QSR Magazine.\n“As a 6-year-old company, issues will come up,” said Josh Halpern, CEO of Big Chicken, per the outlet. “But as long as we have the right village of people all communicating together and working together to smooth out the bumps so that we can grow fast, we can be in a great position to win, and that’s really why we’re raising this capital.”\n\nMaking More Than During Time In The League The venture is faring well and is a contributing factor to O’Neal now earning more than $95 million annually.

There were so many moments this year when it seemed the AI bull market was cooked, only to rise again like the undead and move forward with its insatiable thirst for more capital.\n\nWith the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both closing in on another 20% annual gain, you might think every rock in the AI landscape has been turned over, and there are no diamonds left to mine.\nBut 2025 also showed us that AI is more than just hyperscalers and semiconductors; there's a whole ecosystem of companies needed to keep data centers humming along.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nToday we'll look at four stocks that are still flying under the radar in the AI industry.\nEach company chosen here has a market cap under $5 billion and at least 30% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth over the last three years, with growing profit margins. These stocks were all big winners in 2025, so they might not stay under the radar for long if the AI rally continues.\n\nInnodata Inc. Innodata (NASDAQ: INOD ) made headlines earlier this year when it posted a DiMaggio-esque streak of 19 gains in 20 trading sessions. But like META before it, the impressive streak was followed by a swift and sharp decline. The stock is still beating the S&P 500 year-to-date (YTD), but it's now down over 30% in the last three months. However, both the fundamental and technical data point to a prosperous 2026. The company posted record revenue of over $62 million in Q3 2025, its fifth consecutive top- and bottom-line earnings beat. The $62 million represented a 20% YOY growth from Q3 2024, and management confirmed the full-year 2025 expectation of 45% YOY growth from 2024. Margins have also grown to a comfortable 26%, which should unlock even more EPS growth moving forward.\nINOD shares slumped following their impressive winning streak, but the stock still retained a more than 30% YTD gain as 2025 draws to an end. And despite the recent slump, the technical picture is beginning to show improvement. The stock has once again found support along the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), an area where buyers have repeatedly flooded in this year. With the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showing signs of turning bullish and Benzinga Edge Scores of 96.36 for Growth and 98.53 for Quality, INOD shares could be an even bigger winner in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nTrending: Have $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nEvolv Technologies Inc. Evolv Technologies (NASDAQ: EVLV ) is a tiny $1.2 billion market-cap holding company developing AI security screening services for large-crowd live events. The company's software uses AI to create a touchless security screening process that identifies weapons from everyday items like phones or water bottles. The company isn't yet profitable, but it still recorded more than $100 million in sales last year, and continues to eke toward profitability with each successive earnings beat. The company pulled in a record $42.85 million in revenue in Q3 2025, marking 57% YOY growth, and management raised full-year 2025 revenue guidance to the upper end of $145 million. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is also a massive part of the business model, and management expects ARR to grow more than 20% YOY in 2026.\nThe EVLV chart also looks promising, with the stock running into support at the 200-day SMA as a bullish MACD crossover occurs. The 50-day SMA is the next level to watch here; if bullish price momentum can sustain a break above it, the first quarter of 2026 should be tremendously positive for EVLV investors.\n\nAeva Technologies Inc. Aeva Technologies (NASDAQ: AEVA ) is a tiny $780 million small-cap company designing systems for one of the most crucial innovations in autonomous vehicle technology. The company's primary product is a 4D LiDAR suite with hardware and software applications. LiDAR is the motion-sensing technology powering Waymo's autonomous vehicles, offering superior performance to the traditional cameras used in Tesla's Robotaxis. Aeva experienced tremendous revenue growth in 2024 and 2025, with quarterly sales rising from $800,000 in Q4 2023 to $5.5 million in Q2 2025. Despite revenue dipping to $3.5 million in Q3 2025, the company still posted its eighth consecutive EPS and revenue beat, and recently inked a deal to become the exclusive LiDAR provider to a major European OEM.\nDespite revenue growth and industry tailwinds, AEVA shares have struggled in the second half of 2025, though this is partially due to an unsustainable parabolic rally that saw shares leap from $3 to $37 in just four months. The stock is back under $13 per share, but it now trades at a more reasonable level given that the company still hasn't turned a profit. On the daily chart, the share price is hovering around support at the 200-day SMA, but a bullish MACD crossover is giving investors hope for another rally in 2026.\n\nSee Also: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nSoundhound AI Inc. Soundhound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN ) may not be flying under the radar as much as it was in 2025, but the stock is approaching a key level that could present a great buying opportunity for new investors. Soundhound previously provided Voice AI solutions primarily to the automotive industry, but the company has branched out into other sectors over the last few years, including restaurants, healthcare, and banking. Revenue growth was strong in 2023 and 2024, but absolutely soared in 2025, growing more than 120% YOY. The company's losses also continued to narrow thanks to more substantial margins, and profitability in 2026 is now within reach.\nDespite the excitement surrounding the company, Q4 has been rough for SOUN shareholders. The stock declined rapidly after the RSI triggered an Overbought signal in October and is now down more than 35% over the last three months. However, technical signals are pointing to the bottom potentially being in. The momentum of the stock's descent has slowed now that the RSI sits right at the Oversold threshold, and the MACD is actually showing some buying momentum beginning to return. Small, growth-oriented stocks like SOUN often go through violent whipsawing streaks, and the stock could be poised for a move to the upside.\n\nRead Next: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "Why Baidu Is Soaring Today\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 10:16 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BIDU\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Baidu filed to bring its chipmaking unit public on the Hong Kong Exchange.\nThe filing appeared to alert investors of hidden value in the Chinese tech giant.\nHowever, the strong gains may be more than warranted, based on the unit's most recent valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Baidu ›\nShares of Chinese tech giant Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) were soaring on Friday, up 13.1% as of 12:00 p.m. EDT, with \"China's Google\" reaching its highest stock price since mid-2023.\n\nThe catalyst for today's move was Baidu's confidential filing for an initial public offering of its in-house semiconductor chip design firm, Kunlunxin.\nThe move is thought to unlock value for the tech conglomerate , which may be undervalued based on a sum-of-the-parts calculation.\nIs Baidu's chipmaking arm undervalued? Baidu submitted a filing on New Year's Day to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, later confirming that it intends to list Kunlunxin's shares on the Main Board of the exchange. Of note, Baidu is estimated to own about 59% of its chipmaking subsidiary, and intends to keep the company as an owned subsidiary even after listing Kunlunxin's shares.\n\nReuters reported that Baidu's most recent financing round for Kunlunxin was at a valuation of around 21 billion yuan, which equates to roughly $3 billion. So, if Baidu investors had neglected Baidu's chipmaking subsidiary as just a part of its internal business, the filing might have made investors realize more value was hiding underneath Baidu's corporate umbrella, which spans the company's core search, self-driving, cloud and other AI-related business lines.\nBut it's strange Baidu was up this much on the news It's a bit strange that Baidu's stock price rose so significantly today based on that news. After all, Baidu's market cap increased by about $6 billion today. So, assuming that investors hadn't factored in the valuation of Kunlunxin as a stand-alone subsidiary, one would expect Baidu to rise by only half that amount.\n\nStill, the semiconductor sector was rallying hard today, even outside of the Reuters story about Kunlunxin. Enthusiasm over AI, next week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES), and other bullish analyst notes could all be factors.\nBaidu actually saw revenue and profit declines in its recent earnings report, but has recently sought to disclose more about its smaller but fast-growing AI businesses. It appears the IPO of Kunlunxin is part of that effort.\nYet while AI growth is good to see, weakness in the core digital advertising space is a bit worrisome. Baidu's new AI ventures will take lots of investment, so a declining core business is search advertising puts these new units on the clock to deliver profits at scale.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now? Before you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Baidu wasn’t one of them.

Some of the offending images were later taken down.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nSinkholes and Quake-Hit Roads Expose Japan’s Infrastructure Emergency\nThe French government accused Grok on Friday of generating “clearly illegal” sexual content on X without people’s consent, flagging the matter as potentially violating the European Union’s Digital Services Act. The regulation requires large platforms to mitigate the risk of illegal content spreading, the country said in a statement.\nRepresentatives for xAI ( XAAI.PVT ), the company that develops Grok and runs X, didn’t respond to requests for comment. The chatbot Grok generated a post on X in response to users’ questions on Friday that it had identified “lapses in safeguards” that were being “urgently” fixed.

Grok generates text and images that appear as posts on the social network.\nThe rise of AI tools that can generate realistic pictures of undressed minors highlights the challenges of content moderation and safety systems built into image-generating large language models. Tools that claim to have guardrails can be manipulated, allowing for the proliferation of material that has alarmed child safety advocates. The Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that identifies child sexual abuse material online, reported a 400% increase in such AI-generated imagery in the first six months of 2025.\n“AI products must be tested rigorously before they go to market to ensure they do not have the capability to generate this material,” the foundation’s Chief Executive Officer Kerry Smith said in a statement Friday.\n\nXAI has positioned Grok as more permissive than other mainstream AI models, and last summer introduced a feature called “Spicy Mode” that permits partial adult nudity and sexually suggestive content. The service prohibits pornography involving real people’s likenesses and sexual content involving minors, which is illegal to create or distribute.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, users have prompted Grok to digitally remove clothing from photos — mostly of women — so the subjects appeared to be wearing only underwear or bikinis. This prompted India’s IT ministry to demand a comprehensive review of Grok’s safety features, according to a copy of the complaint posted Friday by Indian Member of Parliament Priyanka Chaturvedi.\n\nIn its statement, the French government said it had reported the sexual content created by Grok to the country’s public prosecutor to get them immediately removed.\nAs AI image generation has become more popular, the leading companies behind the tools have released policies about the depictions of minors. OpenAI prohibits any material that sexualizes children under 18 and bans any users who attempt to generate or upload such material. Google has similar policies that forbid “any modified imagery of an identifiable minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.” Black Forest Labs, an AI startup that has previously worked with X, is among the many generative AI companies that say they filter child abuse and exploitation imagery from the datasets used to train AI models.\n\nIn 2023, researchers found that a massive public dataset used to build popular AI image-generators contained at least 1,008 instances of child sexual abuse material.\nMany companies have faced criticism for failing to protect minors from sexual content.

      "Content": "Here's how much the world's richest people made in 2025\n\nQuartz\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:03 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIt was a record-breaking year for the world's richest people.\nIn 2025, the world’s 500 wealthiest individuals saw their fortunes balloon by an unprecedented $2.2 trillion, driving their combined net worth to nearly $12 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nThis surge was fueled by robust gains across stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities, buoyed by President Donald Trump unleashing a free-market-blitz, cutting corporate taxes and loosening regulations.\n\nTo no surprise, Big Tech dominated the index , as a stock market frenzy for artificial intelligence saw market caps surge.\nAbout a quarter of the index's gains came from just eight people, with all but one in tech. This includes Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Alphabet co-founder Larry Page, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\nAlthough, that's down from last year, when the same eight billionaires accounted for 43% of the total gains.\nMusk continued to top the list. Even as Tesla stock oscillated amid supply chain concerns, Musk's waning popularity, and competition from Chinese electric vehicle makers, his fortunes grew to nearly $623 billion, up by more than $190 billion.\nBut Ellison briefly eclipsed Musk as the world's richest man in September, due to a sudden surge in Oracle's share price, rallying around 25% for the entire month, as the cloud infrastructure company unveiled a $300 billion contract with OpenAI and ramped up AI spending. Yet, since then, broader tech market corrections and concerns about Oracle's rising debt have tempered those gains, with its stock down about 40% since.\n\nTrump and his family saw their net worth reach $6.8 billion, up $282 million in a year, according to the index. Trump’s business ventures span real estate, social media, and financial services, with many explicitly capitalizing on his political following. Just three days before his inauguration, Trump launched the meme coin $TRUMP, and soon offered its top holders a private dinner with him. The president has been widely criticized for the coin, which had added more than $200 million to the family's wealth, according to the index. Columbia Law’s Richard Briffault called it “doubly corrupt,” as Trump simultaneously oversees the cryptocurrency industry’s deregulation.\nWhile U.S. equities posted strong returns, international markets outshone them. The S&P 500 Index posted an annual increase of 17%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng saw gain of 22% and 27%, respectively.\nBut it was a blockbuster year for precious metals, posting one of their best years in decades, as investors poured into safe haven assets like gold and silver. Copper and rare earths, key materials for producing the batteries and electrical wires needed to power green energy, were also in high demand. Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart and Chile’s Luksic family saw their fortunes balloon by billions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Are there any companies outside the Mag 7 that investors should consider in 2026?\nRoundhill Investments Chief Executive Officer Dave Mazza shares his outlook for the AI trade in 2026 on the first trading day of the new year.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nIf uh one is getting bored a little bit with the Mag 7, maybe they're a little more cautious on it given the valuations they tread out, trade out. Where do they go? Are there under the radar tech names people can play that still get them exposure to AI?\n00:15 Speaker B\nWell, it's interesting. I mean the AI trade itself is sort of evolved, right? So the initial push was into the pure uh picks and shovels. Nvidia of course being the massive winner. uh continues to be a winner there of course. Um but now we're seeing it evolve, right? We just mentioned a moment ago a company like Sandisk. What's now investors are saying is what memory do we need in order to actually run uh these large language models sort of in perpetuity. Um and that's one of the reasons why stocks like uh Micron, Sandisk and others have done so well. So I actually think the trade is now evolving, not necessarily into the where the most obvious winners are. Uh what the big question mark is sort of what's going to happen in the software space. Uh names like Service Now, Salesforce have sort of been disappointing in their ability to produce return on investment in their AI build out, um which is one of the reasons why, you know, a company like uh Alphabet was really the big winner last year because they're the triple play when it comes to AI. You know, they have large language models, they're a hyperscaler themselves, um and they can deliver that sort of in uh enterprise and uh consumer applications. Um so I think the trade is still is still on. Uh it's going to be a little bit more volatile because investors are going to start kind of really being more discerning about that spending just as we saw uh with disappointments around Oracle's build out because it's going to be debt funded as opposed to funded from free cash flow.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Just Went All in on AI, Buying Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet. Could AI Stocks Still Deliver Big Returns in 2026?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Druckenmiller opened positions in these three AI leaders in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe billionaire has invested in AI stocks throughout this AI boom.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWhen investing, it's often a great idea to consider the moves of billionaire fund managers. They've demonstrated their knowledge of the stock market over the years, so by following their lead on certain occasions, you might score an investing win too. This doesn't mean you should always copy their moves, though. They might have a tolerance for risk that differs from yours or a shorter or longer investment horizon, for example.\n\nAnd it's important to remember that even these experts often disagree -- while one billionaire may pile into a particular stock, another billionaire may sell or avoid it. So it's key to pay attention to their moves, but then consider your own strategy and budget before taking action.\nToday, I'm taking a look at the recent moves of Stanley Druckenmiller, who oversees $4 billion in 13F securities as head of the Duquesne Family Office. Managers of more than $100 million must declare the buying or selling of these securities to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis -- and this is great for us because it allows us a glimpse into the investment moves of these experts.\nLet's check out Druckenmiller's latest moves and consider whether AI stocks still may deliver big returns in 2026.\n30 years of investment success So, first, it's important to consider Druckenmiller's background. The billionaire operated Duquesne Capital Management for 30 years, and during that time, he didn't have any money-losing years -- and he delivered an annual average return of 30%. Druckenmiller closed the fund about 15 years ago, but he continues to manage money at the helm of his family office .\n\nDruckenmiller has been an investor in AI stocks in recent years, but he shocked the market when he exited top-performing players Nvidia in late 2024 and Palantir Technologies in early 2025. And only one AI stock -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- is among the top five positions in his portfolio. The stock has a 5.2% weight in the portfolio for the No. 4 spot.\nStill, in the third quarter of last year, Druckenmiller made three moves that could be seen as a renewed shift into top AI players. Here they are in detail:\nDruckenmiller opened a position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , buying 437,070 shares. The stock now makes up 2.3% of his portfolio.\nHe opened a position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , buying 76,100 shares. The stock makes up 1.3% of Druckenmiller's holdings.\nThe billionaire opened a position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . He bought 102,200 shares, and the stock makes up 0.6% of his portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nAI in 2026 These stocks may not be Druckenmiller's biggest positions, but it's clear that he's confident about the future of AI. Now the question is: Could AI stocks still deliver big returns in 2026?\nIt's true that AI players have soared in recent years, and the valuations of many also have climbed. But certain players, such as Druckenmiller's purchases, remain reasonably priced considering what I'm about to mention right now.\nAMZN PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nWe're still in the early stages of the AI growth story. While training of AI models has been a big thing in recent times, we have yet to actually apply these models to real-life situations in a major way. This will involve inferencing, or the powering of the models through their \"thinking\" processes so that they can serve their purposes. We should see growth here throughout industries -- and down the road, robotics, telecom, and many other areas should keep the AI growth engine running.\n\nJensen Huang's prediction And even in the next few years, we may see a huge wave of growth. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang predicts AI infrastructure spending may reach as much as $4 trillion.\nTrends tech companies have seen so far support these growth forecasts, with demand for AI products and services soaring in recent quarters.\n\nOf course, stocks may not continue to climb without any interruption -- and it's impossible to predict when temporary pauses may occur. But, considering these points I've mentioned, AI stocks could continue to deliver big returns in 2026, and even if they don't, they're well-positioned to do so over the long term. That's why, for growth investors, it's a great idea to follow billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's moves and pick up a few reasonably priced AI stocks as we head into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "How to Make a 2.0% Income Yield in GOOGL Stock Over the Next Month\n\nMark R. Hake, CFA\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:27 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAlphabet, Inc. ( GOOGL ) is set to announce earnings early next month. Whether GOOGL stock rises or stays flat, investors can make a 2.0% income yield by shorting one-month out-of-the-money put options.\nGOOGL is at $313.02 in morning trading on Friday, Jan. 2, 2026. It's still below $323.44, where it peaked on Nov. 25, but could still be worth considerably more.\n\nMore News from Barchart NVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\nBear Put Spread Screener Results for January 2nd\nWall Street’s Radial Framework Potentially Exposes a Mispriced Opportunity in Ambarella (AMBA) Stock Options\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\nI discussed this in several recent Barchart articles, including on Dec. 14, when I discussed how GOOGL stock could be worth $402.54 per share. That is based on its strong free cash flow (FCF) and its FCF margins.\nIn other words, it has a potential upside of at least $87.00, or approximately + 27.5% .\n\nA lot of this will depend on how strong its ongoing FCF margins will be. Alphabet is set to announce its upcoming Q4 2025 earnings around Feb. 4, according to Seeking Alpha.\nSo, just in case the stock remains flat until then, it might make sense to sell out-of-the-money (OTM) put options to generate extra income.\nShorting Near-Term OTM GOOGL Puts I discussed shorting Jan. 16, 2026, expiration put options at the $295.00 strike price in my Dec. 14 Barchart article, “ How to Make a 1.77% 1-Month Yield in GOOGL Stock - It Still Looks Undervalued .”\nThe premium received by short-sellers of these puts at the time was $5.23 per put contract. Today, that put option premium has dropped to $1.00 . In other words, this has been a successful short play.\n\nThat means an investor could enter an order to “Buy to Close” these puts. That would lock in $4.23 in income over the past 2 weeks. That works out to a one-month yield of\n$4.23/$295.00 x 2 = 1.434% x 2 = 2.87%\nMoreover, this trade can be repeated for the next month. Look at the Feb. 6, 2026, expiration option period. It shows that the $300.00 strike price put option has a midpoint premium of $6.93 per put contract.\nThis works out to a 2.31% one-month yield (i.e., $6.93/$300.00).\nIn other words, an investor who secures $30,000 with their brokerage firm can enter an order to “Sell to Open” 1 put contract at $300.00 for expiration on Feb. 6.\nThat allows the investor to immediately make $693.00 in their account (i.e., $693/$30,000 = 2.31%).\n\nStory Continues\nNote that the $300.00 strike price is still 6.6% below today's trading price, i.e., it's out-of-the-money (OTM). That implies that there is some downside protection.\nFor example, the $30,000 collateral will not be assigned to buy 100 shares unless GOOGL falls to $300.00 on or before Feb. 6.\nMoreover, there is just a 29% chance this will occur, based on its -0.2895 delta ratio. That is based on its historical volatility.\n\nThe shows that this play is a good way to make extra income for existing shareholders. Moreover, for new investors, it's a way to set a lower potential buy-in point.\nThe bottom line is that GOOGL stock is cheap here. Shorting out-of-the-money (OTM) puts is one way to play the stock.\nBuying In-the-Money (ITM) Calls In my last article, I also discussed buying in-the-money (ITM) calls as a way to benefit from any upside in GOOGL stock. An investor can use the short-put income to defray much of the cost of buying ITM calls that are further out in expiration.\nFor example, the $295.00 call expiring July 17, 2026, cost $ 44.93 last month. Today, it's at $45.95.\n\nHowever, an investor would have already collected a net $4.23 and $6.93, or $11.93 in the last two short-put trades. That has lowered the all-in call option cost to just $33.00:\n$44.93 call cost - $11.93 put income = $33.00\nIn other words, the net cost to buy the $295.00 GOOGL calls expiring July 17, 2026, is just $328.00, or less than 5% over today's price:\n$295.00 strike + $33.00 = $328.00\n$328 - $313 = $15,\n$15/$313 = 1.0479 - 1 = +4.79%\nMoreover, if an investor can continue to make a 2.0% yield each month for the next 6 months, or $6.00 per month, the total income would be $36.00. That more than covers the remaining $15.00 and lowers the all-in cost to just $292.00\nIn other words, there would be a net profit of $21.00 even if GOOGL stays flat. That works out to an expected ROI of 7.1% (i.e., 21/$295) over 7 months, or 12.5% annualized.\n\nHowever, if GOOGL rises to $402, the expected return is $110 (i.e., $402-292 net call option cost), or $11,000 on an average monthly investment of $29,500 to sell short the puts (i.e., 37.3%.) That is better than the 28% expected upside from owning GOOGL shares.\nThe point is that this is an excellent way to gain upside in Alphabet stock using short OTM puts and long ITM calls.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

      "Content": "Is This Fund the Ultimate Buy and Hold Investment for the Age of AI?\n\nWilliam Dahl, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Analysts are hotly debating whether Nvidia's position in the age of AI is unassailable.\nYet, it's impossible to know which winners will emerge in a few years' time.\nOne diversified fund with low fees and stellar performance offers a potential solution.\n10 stocks we like better than VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF ›\n\nSome analysts say that semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , whose chips have formed the backbone of the AI revolution so far, should be worried about Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) $900 billion project around tensor processing unit chips.\nOthers say that the OpenAI partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is suddenly threatening Nvidia's 90% market share for graphics processing units. Still others view Nvidia's position as unassailable, with Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya stating the company operates in a \"different galaxy\" than its competitors.\nYet many of us are old enough to remember when Nvidia stock lost a sixth of its value in January 2025, as China's AI chatbot DeepSeek rattled markets, with Wall Street terrified that an AI app made at a fraction of the cost of U.S. rivals could upend the industry.\nThis will be another year of record-breaking AI infrastructure spending, with the \"hyperscalers\" (companies building AI data centers at massive scale) forecast to spend $452.7 billion, according to Morningstar. Their combined capital expenditures will be four times greater than what the publicly traded U.S. energy sector spends to drill oil, refine and transport gasoline, and run large chemical plants.\n\nAnd here's one stunning fact: In the age of AI, Amazon 's capital expenditures are greater than that of America's entire energy sector combined.\nWith multi-trillion-dollar companies sparing no expense to win the AI boom, it's impossible to know which will rise or stumble in the looming wave of disruption. And apart from being unknowable, the question of who wins the battle for market share may be the wrong question to ask. At the end of the day, the AI revolution and the $15.7 trillion in wealth it could create may be big enough for everyone.\nA catch-all fund to play the $15.7 trillion wealth wave For investors seeking exposure to some of the most entrenched leaders of the AI revolution, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) is a straightforward play.\nThe exchange-traded fund, with its $37.6 billion in total net assets, is designed to track the returns, as closely as possible before fees and expenses, of the 25 largest and most liquid semiconductor firms. And since ChatGPT ushered in the age of AI in late 2022, its returns have been impressive.\n\nStory Continues\nOver the last three years, the fund has achieved an average annual return of 46.83%. This return leaves the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite , with its three-year average annual gain of 31.12%, in the dust.\nAlas, these gains are in the past, and aren't reliable indicators of how the fund could perform going forward. But there are three reasons I like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF as a catch-all play to tap into the wave of AI-driven wealth creation without betting everything on one or two volatile stocks.\n\nFirst, the fund is diversified, with its largest holding, Nvidia, making up 21% of its portfolio. Its next largest holding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , makes up just over 10% of the portfolio, while none of its other top 10 holdings crack double digits.\nBecause its methodology allows portfolio selection for both domestic and U.S.-listed foreign companies, the fund is geographically diversified as well. However, it is oriented toward large-cap companies, as it seeks to mirror the returns of the largest and most established semiconductor firms. This doesn't bother me, as I'm more interested in deep-pocketed firms that can spare no expense in protecting their industry leadership and even gain footholds in new markets.\nSecond, the fund offers at least a partial solution to investors who fear overvaluation in AI companies. The average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of its holdings, weighted as a percentage of its portfolio, amounts to 41.3. That means its shares trade at a premium relative to the broader market, but when you consider how fast its top holdings are growing earnings (at 65% year-over-year in Nvidia's case) it's far from the \"nosebleed valuation\" P/E ratios of around 200 seen at the eve of the dot.com bubble collapse.\n\nThirdly, the fund carries a modest expense ratio of just 0.35%, compared to the industry average of 0.56%. The below-average fee means that for every $10,000 invested, just $35 goes toward management fees.\nGiven the fund's stellar performance, both over the last three years and since its 2011 inception, in which shares have returned 26.8% on average each year, this management fee seems reasonable, to say the least. For investors who prioritize capital appreciation, diversification, and a simple and effective way to play the ongoing AI boom, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is worthy of consideration.\nShould you buy stock in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF right now?

      "Content": "Benchmark Boosts Broadcom’s (AVGO) Price Target Amid AI Chip Growth\n\nSheryar Siddiq\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 6:10 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ) ranks among the best AI stocks to buy according to analysts . Citing robust development in the AI semiconductor industry, Benchmark increased its price target for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) from $385 to $485 on December 12, retaining a Buy rating on the company’s shares. According to Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), its AI semiconductor division achieved $6.5 billion in Q4, improving 76% year-over-year and 25% sequentially.\nThe company reported $21 billion in orders from Anthropic over the last two quarters, while its six-quarter AI order backlog climbed to $73 billion. Broadcom’s list of clients now includes giants like Meta, ByteDance, and Google, as well as an additional contract with OpenAI to supply $1 billion in chips by late 2026.\n\nAccording to Reuters, while Broadcom’s backlog is scheduled to ship over the next 18 months, CFO Kirsten Spears warned that margins could fall. She stated that the Q1 consolidated gross margin is likely to fall roughly 100 basis points sequentially, owing to a higher percentage of AI revenue.\nAnalysts quoted by Reuters emphasize two main risks for the company, including its excessive concentration on just five AI customers, and weaker margins on AI systems, which are likely to account for a greater share of the total revenue in coming quarters, notably in the second half of fiscal year 2026.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies various semiconductor devices and infrastructure software solutions worldwide. The company operates in two segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Will Chegg's AI Upgrades Fix the Collapse in Its Legacy Traffic?\n\nSraddha Singha\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 6:09 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CHGG\n\nGOOG\n\nChegg, Inc. ’s CHGG core academic business has been significantly impacted by the rapid adoption of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a sharp decline in Google-driven traffic. This resulted in a more than 40% year-over-year decline in revenues in the third quarter of 2025. With AI-powered search disrupting the process of students accessing academic help, CHGG’s legacy traffic has reduced by nearly 50% as of the third quarter of 2025.\n\nGiven the shift in the market trends, Chegg has been heavily investing in AI to improve efficiency, automate content delivery and enhance user experience across Chegg Study, Math and Writing. These upgrades will allow the company to serve most student queries using its existing database of more than 130 million questions, significantly lowering costs and capital intensity. As a result, CHGG has been able to slash operating expenses and reposition the legacy unit as a cash-generating business rather than a growth engine.\n\nHowever, with a high-quality AI-enhanced product, Chegg admits it cannot compete head-on with free, embedded AI answers offered directly through search engines and large language models. Notably, Chegg’s AI strategy is increasingly about prolonging the tail of the legacy business while funding its pivot to Chegg Skilling. AI has enabled leaner operations, lowered capital expenditure and ensured better margin prospects, helping the academic segment generate cash for several years.\n\nSumming up, Chegg’s AI upgrades are unlikely to “fix” the collapse in legacy traffic; rather, they serve as a defensive tool by stabilizing cash flows and buying time. The trends will continue while the company shifts its long-term growth ambitions toward B2B skilling, language learning and workforce AI education.\n\nChegg’s Competitive Position in the EdTech Market Chegg operates in a highly competitive landscape, with renowned names like Duolingo, Inc. DUOL and Udemy, Inc. UDMY operating beside it in the ed tech market.\n\nDuolingo dominates the language-learning niche with its gamified app and AI-driven engagement. With a strong mobile presence and daily user engagement, Duolingo has built a brand synonymous with accessible, bite-sized learning. On the other hand, Udemy continues to scale its vast marketplace model, leveraging thousands of independent instructors to address fast-changing professional and technical learning needs.\n\nChegg’s challenge is proving that its B2B skilling pivot can deliver durable growth, while Udemy continues expanding its corporate footprint and Duolingo deepens monetization through subscriptions and new product lines. Ultimately, Chegg, Udemy and Duolingo illustrate three divergent approaches to competing in an ed-tech market reshaped by AI, corporate upskilling demand and the need for measurable learning outcomes.\n\nStory Continues\nChegg Stock’s Price Performance & Valuation Trend Shares of this California-based education technology company have inched up 2.4% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Internet - Software industry, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 Index.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCHGG stock is currently trading at a discount compared with the industry peers, with a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.27, as evidenced by the chart below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Estimate Trend of CHGG The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss has widened in the past 60 days to 14 cents, while earnings estimates for 2026 have moved up to 18 cents during the same time frame.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile the estimated figure for 2025 indicates a decline of 118.7% year over year, estimates for 2026 indicate 228.6% growth.\n\nChegg stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "CES 2026: What to expect from the tech industry’s biggest show of the year\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 6:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nQCOM\n\nMETA\n\nWelcome to 2026. Now rinse out that champagne glass and pop some Advil because the tech industry’s biggest show of the year, CES, kicks off on Jan. 6 under the bright lights of Las Vegas.\nCompanies big and small will take over the famed Strip and Las Vegas Convention Center, debuting their latest and greatest offerings, and a good helping of fly-by-night products that’ll never see the light of day.\n\nWhile the show officially begins on Jan. 6, the festivities start a few days earlier with events like CES Unveiled and press conferences featuring Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang and AMD ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su. And that means you can expect artificial intelligence to be front and center at the trade show.\nThat will include everything from AI-focused PCs to new chips. But robots are looking like they’ll steal the spotlight in 2026.\n“​Every year CES has a theme. And sometimes you don't know what it is until you get to the show, and everybody's talking about it” explained Kinsey Fabrizio, president of the Consumer Technology Association trade organization, which runs CES.\n“But we can tell you right now, robotics is going to be talked about … big time at CES.”\n\nYahoo Finance will be live and in person in Vegas bringing you all of the latest news and announcements. Here’s what we’re anticipating at CES 2026.\nWhat to expect at CES CES has become a kind of battleground for chipmakers and designers to show off their wares to the world right alongside their biggest rivals.\nLast year, Nvidia was the talk of Las Vegas when Huang held a keynote in front of a massive audience at the Michelob Ultra Arena, debuting the company's newest lineup of gaming chips, a desktop-sized AI rig, and a variety of AI software services and platforms.\nThis year, you can expect even more from the company that closed out 2025 with a $4.5 trillion market cap. Huang, who is scheduled to take the stage at 1:00 p.m. PT on Jan. 5 will likely unveil new gaming offerings, as well as a host of AI apps and capabilities.\nAMD’s Su will then host her own keynote a few hours later at 6:30 p.m. PT, giving that company’s rebuttal to Nvidia’s announcements and providing updates on its own gaming and AI products.\n\nJim Johnson, Senior vice president and GM of Intel's ( INTC ) Client Computing Group, which covers sales of the company’s chips for consumer and enterprise PCs, will also hold a keynote at CES 2026 where he’s expected to provide updates on Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, chips.\nThe processors, which Intel initially revealed in October, are the first to use the company’s highly anticipated 18A chip technology, and are a key part of its broader turnaround effort.\n\nStory Continues\nQualcomm ( QCOM ) will also be on hand at CES, with CEO Cristiano Amon set to participate in a fireside chat with Fortune’s Andrew Nusca. Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon X-series processors for Windows PCs during CES 2025 and will likely build on that momentum at this year’s event.\nEach of the chipmakers will likely provide insights into their plans to power physical AI systems, a technical term for robots, during the show.\nExpect to see humanoid robots on display, as well as a number of robotic arms, AI-powered drones, and self-driving cars scattered across Las Vegas this year, as the industry looks to rapidly advance the technology.\nSpeaking of cars, CES has become a major showcase for the auto industry’s tech ambitions, and this year will be no different. The show will likely include flying car concepts, a mainstay in recent years, as well as a variety of ways car companies are looking to capitalize on the AI trend by incorporating the technology into their vehicles’ dashboards.\n\nAI-powered wearables and fitness trackers could also make their debut at CES 2026. Those can come in the form of smart rings, glasses, or pins. The smart glasses space in particular has gained plenty of attention with the launch of Meta’s ( META ) Ray-Ban Display glasses in September, and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Samsung planning their own smart glasses.\nApple ( AAPL ) is also reportedly looking to get into the smart glasses game, though the company eschews making an appearance at CES in favor of hosting its own highly polished events at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., throughout the year.\nNaturally, there are sure to be some outlandish products at CES 2026. Over the years, we’ve seen everything from smart toilets to forks designed to help you eat healthier foods.\nIt’s sure to be an interesting show, and Yahoo Finance will bring you all of the biggest announcements as they happen.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "We Asked ChatGPT What the Top-Performing Stocks of 2026 Will Be: Do Investing Experts Agree?\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:49 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nThe stock markets have a hard act to follow in 2026 after setting record highs in 2025. As of the market close on Dec. 30, 2025, the S&P 500 was up by about 17.5% for the year, while the Nasdaq had gained 21.5% and the Dow was up 14.1%.\nWhile it’s hard to predict what’s in store for 2026, some stocks seem poised to keep pushing higher. Which ones will be the top performers in 2026? GOBankingRates asked ChatGPT — and the stocks it picked include some of the hottest names on Wall Street.\n\nHere are the top four stocks picked by ChatGPT, along with its key points about the picks and what other experts have to say .\nNvidia (NVDA) The first stock pick on ChatGPT’s list was Nvidia. Here were its strengths, risks and what to keep an eye on, per ChatGPT.\nStrengths: It’s considered a “top growth stock” thanks to its leadership in graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. “As long as data center build-out and AI compute demand continue, NVDA could benefit,” ChatGPT said.\nRisks: It has a very high valuation, and there’s also supply chain/export/competitive risk. “If AI hype slows, the multiple could contract,” ChatGPT explained.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Earnings growth, new GPU launches, data center contract pipeline and margin trends.\n\nNot everyone believes Nvidia’s momentum is sustainable. Among the skeptics is Chad Cummings, an attorney and CPA at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax with American Airlines, PwC and JPMorgan Chase.\n“The Nvidia train is running out of steam,” he told GOBankingRates. “We are advising clients to exit their positions before year-end. Its growth depends on hyperscalers continuing unsustainable data center expansion. One slowdown or energy bottleneck unravels the narrative.”\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Next up on ChatGPT’s list was Microsoft, and it cited these strengths, weaknesses and key factors to keep an eye on.\nStrengths: It’s considered a leading AI infrastructure/cloud play moving into 2026 with a “strong recurring revenue base” and “large market share in cloud, enterprise and AI tools,” per ChatGPT.\nRisks: Its stock growth could decelerate due to “valuation crowding,” meaning shares might soon be seen as overvalued.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Growth in Microsoft’s cloud computing service business, as well as continued AI product launches.\nDespite Microsoft’s robust growth and strong AI position, Cummings called the company “particularly worrisome” because of potential legal and performance problems.\n\nStory Continues\n“Embedding AI in core enterprise tools without clear indemnity invites securities fraud, employment discrimination and professional malpractice claims,” he said. “Several memes have been making the rounds on finance blogs … showing that Microsoft’s integration of AI into Excel produces comedically false mathematical results.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) The parent company of Google also made ChatGPT’s list. Here are some key things to note.\nStrengths: Growth in its ad/search business, along with potentially lucrative AI investments , are key strengths.\nRisks: Ad revenue could slow, while the company’s ambitious, innovation-focused Moonshot Factory business “might not pay off” in 2026.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Ad revenue trends, cloud growth and new product/AI service announcements.\n\nMany analysts remain bullish on Alphabet’s prospects. In November, Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson changed his rating from a “Hold” to a “Buy” on the stock, per TheStreet .\nHis reasoning for the upgrade was that Google has proved that its dominance isn’t going anywhere, as reported by TheStreet.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Last on the list for ChatGPT was Advanced Micro Devices. Here are some of its key strengths and risks, as well as what investors should eye in 2026.\nStrengths: It’s seen AI/data center revenue growth and recent large contract wins.\nRisks: It faces competition from companies such as Nvidia and Intel, along with “margin pressure” and “execution risk,” per ChatGPT.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Data-center GPU revenue growth and contract announcements.\n\nIn a recent analysis, The Motley Fool predicted that Advanced Micro Devices will become a trillion-dollar company by 2030. To get there, its market cap (currently about $350 billion) will have to rise by around 185% over the next four years.\nTo back up its claim, The Motley Fool pointed to a deal the company recently signed with OpenAI to deploy six gigawatts of AMD data center chips by 2030. It also praised AMD’s CPU/GPU business for PCs, which has “steadily gained market share over the past decade.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans Hit by a Costly Holiday Scam, Norton Survey Shows -- How To Avoid This\nHere's What Retirees Wasted the Most Money On in 2025 -- and How To Avoid It in 2026\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : We Asked ChatGPT What the Top-Performing Stocks of 2026 Will Be: Do Investing Experts Agree?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Google ex-CEO Eric Schmidt jumps into the AI data center business with a failed, 150-year-old Texas railroad turned oil giant\n\nJordan Blum\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTPL\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt is getting into the AI and data center race with his new startup, and he’s betting on rural West Texas and a failed railroad turned oil giant to help him build enough power to light up 7 million homes.\nSchmidt’s new Bolt Data & Energy is taking the one-stop shop approach for hyperscalers’ land, power, and water needs for their data center campuses. Bolt has teamed up with Texas Pacific Land, a little-known oil and gas player with a long history and a $20 billion market cap that happens to offer 882,000 acres of West Texas land—more acreage than Rhode Island—with easy access to natural gas and renewable energy resources. Oh, and the company just so happens to have its own water services business for oil and gas that can translate to help for thirsty data centers as well.\n\n“Energy is the main constraint in scaling AI. If we want to keep America competitive, we have to solve this problem. Bolt was created to address this challenge,” Schmidt said in an emailed interview with Fortune . “We realized that combining my technical expertise with TPL’s unrivaled land, abundant water, and access to low-cost energy could create the infrastructure needed to meet the virtually infinite demand for compute.”\nHaving literally co-authored the book on AI— The Age of AI: And Our Human Future, in 2021, a year before the launch of ChatGPT—Schmidt sees the age of AI and advanced robotics as the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” He believes data center campus developers such as Bolt are necessary to compete with China in the global AI race.\n\n“Our platform begins with West Texas’ abundant natural gas but is designed to transition to renewable and clean energy, with nuclear power also included in future plans,” Schmidt said. “By integrating land, power generation, and data centers, we can create a scalable, resilient infrastructure capable of meeting the growing global demand for compute. Our goal is to ensure AI develops responsibly, supports American competitiveness, and delivers technology that benefits humanity while minimizing climate impact.”\nSchmidt, 70, served as Google’s CEO for a decade, from 2001 to 2011, and then continued as executive chairman of Google and then Alphabet through 2017 and as technical advisor until 2020. He’s stayed plenty busy since, though. He’s also now the CEO of aerospace manufacturer Relatively Space, and cofounder of the non-profit that organizes the AI+ Expo for National Competitiveness.\n\nSchmidt is the chairman of Bolt, and he cofounded it with Investors Todd Meister and Allan Tessler, who is a major investor in Texas Pacific Land. To date, Bolt has raised $150 million in initial capital, with TPL contributing a $50 million investment, including right of first refusal to supply critical water resources to the new data center projects.\n\nStory Continues\n“We felt like we wanted to capture more of the value chain than just a land lease or a water contract, so that’s why we actually invested in Bolt,” Texas Pacific Land CEO Ty Glover told Fortune . “When you’re looking at who you might want to partner with in a space that you’re not an expert in, then who better than a titan of that industry like Eric Schmidt.”\nWest Texas as an AI epicenter To understand how Texas Pacific Land came by such a massive acreage holding, it helps to look back at its history of more than 150 years.\nThe legacy dates to 1871, when a federal charter was granted to build a national railroad from Texas to California. At the time, railroad companies received federal land grants in exchange for laying tracks.\n\nThe railroad failed for a variety of financial reasons, but it resulted in the formation of the Texas Pacific Land Trust to manage the railroad’s acreage. That acreage became quite valuable when the Texas oil boom took hold in the Permian Basin more than a century ago.\nTexas Pacific has been publicly traded for almost 100 years, but it existed as a sleepy trust collecting oil and gas royalties until 2021, when an investor feud resulted in the trust converting into a much more proactive corporation.\n“Coming from a failed railroad to a gorilla in the oil and gas space and now entering the AI space is exciting. It’s a new frontier for us and for West Texas,” Glover said.\nAs legacy data center regions like Virginia get saturated with facilities, the frontier regions such as West Texas are going be more attractive, Glover said, with easier regulatory environments and more sparse populations.\n\n“Our hope is we’re moving dirt on projects within the next couple of years,” he said. “What’s attractive about TPL is we can really scale this. You can build multiple, multi-gig data center campuses with one owner. Just like in other industries, scale really matters here.”\nSchmidt said Bolt plans to start with one anchor customer and grow from there. He name-dropped many potential anchors: Google, Microsoft , Meta , Amazon , Oracle , OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Palantir, and even the White House’s new Genesis Mission for AI.\nBolt is taking a bespoke approach similar to that of Texas-based AI power startup Fermi, backed by former U.S. energy secretary and Texas governor Rick Perry. Fermi launched an IPO in October before it had even started collecting revenue and quickly surged to a $16 billion market cap, though its value has since plunged to $5 billion at the end of 2025. However, Bolt is staying private and not banking on public investor interest in the AI boom.\n\nThe plan is to start with natural gas-fired power and grow to 1 gigawatt capacity, Schmidt said, then build more campuses as the power generation sources expand to include wind, solar, and battery power and, eventually, nuclear power over time. The goal is to grow to 10 gigawatts of power—enough to electrify about 7 million homes—on Texas Pacific Land acreage.\n“We’re taking a different approach from traditional data center models that lease space and buy power from the grid. By vertically integrating energy ownership with advanced data infrastructure, we can design a platform that is both efficient and resilient,” Schmidt said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in 2026 and Hold for the Rest of the Decade\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 2:40 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nIBM\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's diverse business and comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) stack make the company a safe investment.\nTesla is swinging for the fences with Tesla Optimus, but it best not miss.\nInternational Business Machines is a proven dividend stock, a rarity in the AI space.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe stock market is poised to enter the second half of the 2020s as the new year arrives.\nIt's an exciting time for investors and society as a whole. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past few years has given rise to several new and emerging industries. Self-driving vehicles, humanoid robotics, and quantum computing are just a few of the ways investors could strike it big over the next four to five years.\nHere are three AI stocks investors should consider buying and holding for the rest of this decade. Each stock is unique in what it offers, giving investors some refreshing variety in how to invest in AI's promising future of technological innovation.\n1. This AI stock has a high floor The unpredictable nature of a new and exciting field like AI makes it wise to invest in stocks with a high floor, meaning low chances of a catastrophic outcome. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the internet giant and parent company of Google, is a notable example. It has developed its own AI models and trained them on first-party data, and it owns a top cloud computing platform. That makes it arguably the most complete AI company.\n\nIronically, Alphabet's fate doesn't necessarily rely on AI. Yes, it's a fantastic growth opportunity, but Alphabet's core digital advertising business, through Google and YouTube, generated $74.1 billion in revenue during the third quarter alone. Alphabet's robust profit margins generate billions of dollars in cash flow, which it uses to fund its AI investments without adding prohibitive amounts of debt to its balance sheet.\nIn addition to all that, Alphabet continues to pursue growth in new industries. It is steadily expanding Waymo, its autonomous ride-hailing business, and has ongoing efforts in quantum computing technology. Alphabet's strong core business and stellar companywide performance make it a dependable choice for buy-and-hold investors over the next three to five years.\n\n2. High risk, high reward with this robotics play If you're willing to take a bigger risk for the sake of more upside, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) could be a stock worth considering. Most know Tesla for its electric vehicles and energy storage systems, but CEO Elon Musk has steered the company hard into AI and robotics. More specifically, Musk has argued that its humanoid robot, Tesla Optimus, will eventually represent most of Tesla's value.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Musk has made lofty promises and frequently missed target dates, there's no arguing against Tesla's stock performance, which has vastly outperformed the broader market over the years. That doesn't guarantee future success, but the humanoid robotics market is a massive opportunity. Experts believe it could grow into a $5 trillion total addressable market by 2050.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla's core vehicle business has struggled in recent quarters. That could change for the better, and Tesla's own autonomous ride-hailing service, Robotaxi, launched earlier this year.\nStill, it highlights the stock's potentially low floor if Tesla doesn't deliver on Musk's promises. Investing in Tesla is ultimately a bet on Musk's continued leadership and execution, something investors should consider before purchasing shares.\n3. A rare AI dividend stock AI and technology often scream growth stocks. International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) , also known as IBM, may appeal to investors seeking dividend income. IBM is a longtime player in the tech sector, and to its credit, has managed to evolve with the times, remaining a relevant competitor. It has positioned itself as a leader in hybrid cloud computing, with deep corporate relationships.\n\nIBM is helping its customer base adopt and integrate AI technology, often through consulting services, and is a leading developer of quantum computing systems and development software. The company pays a dividend that currently yields 2.2%, and IBM has raised the dividend for 29 consecutive years, a reflection of its ability to grow over decades.\nIBM continues to expand its AI ecosystem through bolt-on mergers and acquisitions, fertile ground to continue monetizing its customer relationships as a full-tech solutions provider. Analysts anticipate IBM's earnings growing at a high-single-digit annualized rate over the next three to five years. That won't make investors rich overnight, but it will continue to fund dividend increases, with some added price upside along the way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs.\nOther assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds.\nTo be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters.\nTom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026.\n“Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?”\nCrypto market movers Bitcoin is up 1.7% over the past 24 hours, trading at $89,135.\nEthereum is up 2% over the past 24 hours and trading at $3,040.\nWhat we’re reading Six blockbuster crypto IPOs to watch in 2026 — DL News\nBitcoin miners to tap Zaporizhzhia nuclear power — if there’s a peace deal in Ukraine — DL News\nCrypto.com to Hire In-House Market Maker for Prediction Markets — Unchained\nAlt season ‘26: What it will take — Milk Road\nFive crypto airdrops to watch for in 2026 — DL News\nLance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

      "Content": "The Real Money in AI Might Be in Power Cooling and Connectivity\n\nJohn Bromels, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 9:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nVRT\n\nANET\n\nKey Points AI hyperscalers like Microsoft and Alphabet have notched double-digit revenue growth over the last three years.\nTop power cooling company Vertiv and connectivity provider Arista Networks have grown revenue and net income even faster.\nBut the market has caught on: These AI infrastructure plays trade at high valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nLast week, news circulated that Sam Altman's OpenAI had assigned itself a valuation of $830 billion.\nHowever, that nosebleed valuation was challenged by analysts who pointed to competition from rivals like Anthropic and Alphabet 's Google and asked whether the current breakneck pace of artificial intelligence (AI) spending is sustainable.\nGiven the challenges of trying to pick a winner in this space, investors might be better off looking at pick-and-shovel plays in the AI space. Surprisingly, many of them seem to be faring even better than the marquee AI companies right now. Is the real money in AI in the power cooling and connectivity space?\nWhere the revenue is growing If you look at revenue growth for some of the biggest AI-focused companies -- those developing AI-powered software and solutions -- you'll see some impressive numbers.\nAlphabet, maker of Gemini and a heavy investor in AI features, has increased its trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue by 37.3% over the last three years. And Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , which has been integrating AI applications like Copilot into its products, has grown TTM revenue by 44% during that same period.\n\nThose are stellar growth numbers, particularly from such massive companies. Yet they pale in comparison to the revenue growth being experienced by some of the AI industry's pick-and-shovel plays.\nVertiv Holdings (NYSE: VRT) , a maker of industrial cooling and electrical systems, including those used by data centers, has seen its TTM revenue grow by 70.4% over the last three years. TTM revenue at Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) , which manufactures electrical switches and networking infrastructure that are also critical for data centers, has grown by 92.8% over that period.\nThe AI infrastructure plays seem to be smoking the more traditional AI companies when it comes to revenue growth.\nProfits are growing even faster It would be one thing if the companies were growing their revenue but not their profits, indicating that most of the revenue growth was being eaten up in increased expenses. However, the opposite appears to be happening. All of these companies have grown their net income much faster than their revenue over the last three years.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's net income has grown by 55.5% since December 2022, while Alphabet's has more than doubled, with three-year growth of 107.2%. But once again, that pales in comparison to Arista Networks' 148.2% net income growth and Vertiv's jaw-dropping 1,250% growth in net income over the same time period.\n\nTo be fair, both Vertiv and Arista have much smaller net incomes -- of $1 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively -- than the $100 billion-plus net incomes of the tech giants, but the point is that not only are Vertiv and Arista growing revenue faster than Alphabet and Microsoft, they're also growing their profits more quickly.\nPremium valuations If power cooling and connectivity are where the money is, the market seems to have already caught on. Arista and Vertiv may be growing faster than their AI-wielding counterparts, but that faster growth is also baked into their share prices.\nLooking at the forward price-to-earnings ratio -- which accounts for near-term growth -- we find that Microsoft and Alphabet are practically identically valued at 30 times forward earnings and 29.7 times forward earnings, respectively. Compare them to Vertiv, which is trading at 40.6 times forward earnings, and Arista, which is trading at 45.8 times forward earnings. The difference is even more stark if we look at trailing earnings, with Vertiv's 63.2 and Arista's 50.2 sharply higher than Microsoft's 34.7 and Alphabet's 30.9.\n\nOf course, the fact that the market is assigning a higher valuation to makers of network switches, power connectors, and integrated cooling equipment than it is to the makers of AI tools like Gemini and Copilot says a lot about where investors see the best odds for growth.\nWhile you should expect to pay a premium for these kinds of companies as the AI buildout continues, smart investors will put together a watchlist of pick-and-shovel AI companies and keep an eye out for potential short-term dips in share price that might offer more attractive buying opportunities.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "3 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 7:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTOST\n\nBROS\n\nKey Points Alphabet has a big AI growth opportunity.\nToast is seeing strong revenue growth and starting to expand into adjacent markets.\nDutch Bros is seeing strong same-store sales growth and has a long runway of store expansion ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nGrowth stocks have helped lead the market higher for much of the past decade, and right now, there's no reason to think this trend won't continue. The market loves to reward the stocks of companies with strong revenue and earnings-growth opportunities ahead.\nHere are three great growth stocks to buy now and hold for the long term.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has long been a digital-advertising juggernaut through its Google search engine and YouTube streaming platform. That remains the case today, but artificial intelligence (AI) is the company's biggest growth opportunity ahead.\nAlphabet has become an AI leader by controlling the whole AI stack by having its own custom AI chips and developing its own world-class large language model (LLM) in Gemini. This gives it a cost advantage and lets it enjoy more AI revenue streams.\n\nThe company has seen robust growth at its cloud computing unit Google Cloud, which saw its revenue and operating income soar 34% and 85%, respectively. AI is also helping drive search queries and revenue growth, as Alphabet has embedded AI throughout its products with such features as AI Mode and AI Overviews, as well as new ways to search, like Lens and Circle to Search.\nGiven its AI and digital ad leadership, as well as emerging bets in the fields of robotaxis (Waymo) and quantum computing, Alphabet is a top growth stock to own.\n2. Toast The restaurant industry can be tough, but Toast (NYSE: TOST) has become an important partner in helping small- and mid-sized restaurants succeed. The company's platform can help customers run their entire operations, including not just payment processing, but everything from marketing and menu design to staffing and payroll. The more modules customers adopt, the more money Toast makes and the stickier its platform becomes.\n\nMeanwhile, the company benefits from its customers' success through its payment processing, where it gets around 50 basis points. This is notably a much lower take rate than what's charged by companies like Block , formerly Square, and Clover.\nToast has been seeing strong growth, with its annual recurring revenue (ARR) -- which consists of its subscription revenue and payment processing gross profits annualized for the full year -- climbing 30% last quarter. Meanwhile, it added 7,500 new net locations in Q3, up 23%.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company is also starting to gain traction outside its core U.S. small- and mid-market restaurant customers, winning deals with larger chains, food and beverage retailers, and beginning to expand into international markets. Toast is a fast-growing compounder with a long runway of growth, making it a solid stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\n3. Dutch Bros Among restaurant operators, Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) is one of the best growth stories in the space. The coffee-shop operator has been seeing strong same-store sales growth, highlighted by a 5.7% increase last quarter, with 4.7% growth in transactions. Company-owned locations have been performing even better, with comparable-store sales up 7.4%.\n\nDutch Bros' strong same-store sales growth is being driven by the introduction of mobile order-ahead ordering, menu innovation, and increased marketing to expand brand awareness. Meanwhile, the company has a big opportunity with the planned introduction of hot food items in about 75% of its stores. The coffee-shop operators saw a 4% lift in same-store sales from select locations that tested the food offerings, and the impact could be even greater once it's fully rolled out and it markets these items more.\nAt the same time, the company has a long runway of expansion. With less than 1,100 locations at the end of Q3, Dutch Bros' goal is to reach 2,029 by 2029. It currently plans to open 175 locations in 2026, which would be an approximately 15% increase. Overall, the company thinks it can support around 7,000 locations in the U.S. over the long term.\n\nThanks to its same-store sales growth and expansion opportunities, Dutch Bros is a growth stock to own for the long haul.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Worried About an AI Bubble? Buy This Tech Stock in 2026.\n\nBen Gran, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 6:38 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points An estimated 75% of stock market returns since November 2022 have come from AI stocks.\nIn the past six months, Apple has outperformed most AI stocks.\nApple is expecting 10%-12% revenue growth in its current quarter, with strong iPhone sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been driving some of the biggest gains in the stock market in recent years. A report from JP Morgan Asset Management found that ever since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns. Major tech companies like Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in high-powered chips and vast data centers to build the infrastructure of AI, which they hope will lead the next transformative wave of innovation and economic growth.\n\nBut in the past few months, some investors have turned skeptical about the AI stock story. In August 2025, an MIT study was published showing that 95% of generative AI projects at businesses failed to deliver a measurable return on investment. This MIT study was a potential warning sign to investors. If businesses can't figure out how to use AI to make money, save money, or be more productive and efficient, all of this AI capital expenditure (capex) spending by these major tech companies might not pay off, and would be halted.\nSome investors are concerned that AI companies are spending too much on capital expenditures for AI, that AI is not demonstrating enough clear real-world use cases and profitable product opportunities, and that the expected returns on all of this AI capex might not arrive. The AI boom might turn into an AI bubble .\n\nThe good news is that no matter what happens next with AI companies, you can still invest in a major tech stock that might not be affected by a possible AI bubble. Here's a closer look at why this company could be a good stock to buy in 2026.\nApple is outside of any AI bubble Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the world's largest and most influential tech companies, but it's not an \"AI company\" or an \"AI stock\" in the same way as Oracle , Nvidia , Microsoft, or Alphabet is. That's because Apple's not spending nearly as much on AI as these other companies, and Apple's business model doesn't depend on the future promise of AI. In fact, earlier in 2025, Apple was widely criticized for not moving fast enough on AI and being \"behind\" on AI strategy.\n\nBut Apple's patient approach to AI might turn out to be a good thing for Apple shareholders. Apple has managed to avoid getting dragged into a costly AI arms race. Instead of plowing billions of dollars into data centers, Apple has focused on its core business of selling phones and laptops. If you're worried that valuations of AI stocks have gone too high, but you don't want to give up on \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, Apple could be a good choice.\n\nStory Continues\nApple is poised to thrive in 2026 During the past six months, Apple stock is up roughly 33% while the S&P 500 is up 11%. Apple also outperformed major AI stocks like Nvidia and Oracle, and other AI-related tech stocks like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. The launch of the iPhone 17 in September 2025 was a huge success, generating blockbuster demand. Apple is expected to ship 247.4 million iPhones in 2025, a 6.1% year-over-year increase, according to IDC.\nOn its most recent earnings call, in October, Apple announced record-breaking numbers. The company earned $416 billion of revenue in its fiscal year 2025 (an all-time record), and its fourth-quarter revenue of $102.5 billion was an 8% year-over-year increase. iPhone revenue was up 6% year over year and hit a new September-ended quarter record. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.85, another September-ended quarter record, and up 13% year-over-year, excluding a one-time charge from 2024.\n\nApple's services revenue was up 15% year over year in the quarter, which is an all-time record. Services have become a major profit engine for Apple because the margins on digital services are so high compared to physical products. Apple's gross margin for services was about 75% in its latest earnings report, compared to 36% for Apple products.\nAnd the services segment is becoming a bigger slice of Apple's overall revenue. In its Q3 earnings for fiscal year 2025, Apple made more sales from services ($28.75 billion) than it made from all of its non-iPhone products combined (Macs, iPads and Wearables made $24.69 billion of sales).\nAnd there are good reasons for investor optimism about Apple to continue into 2026. The company expects to see 10%-12% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2026, with double-digit iPhone revenue growth. That quarter is wrapping up now and includes the holiday selling period. Analysts have raised their estimate for Apple's earnings per share to $2.67 for the current quarter, up from $1.77 for Q4 of Apple's fiscal 2025.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, Apple stock is not cheap compared to where its P/E ratio has been in the past few years. But if investors continue to shy away from high-priced AI stocks, and if more signs of real-world return on investment from AI don't materialize fast enough, Apple could look like a better deal than tech stocks that have more AI exposure.\nUnless some new must-have device gets invented that can replace the iPhone, Apple seems well-positioned to stay highly profitable for a long time to come. No matter what happens next with the possible AI bubble, Apple should be a good stock to buy in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?

      "Content": "5 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 1:35 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: LMND\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet all have strong AI moats in different ways that give them an edge over the competition.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the backbone of AI creation and is trading at an excellent price.\nLemonade is expecting to reach adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has driven the market to the tune of an 81% gain over the past three years. The eight most highly valued companies in the world are all AI companies, and it looks like many of them are just getting started.\nWill 2026 be another winning year for AI, or is the bubble about to burst?\nSince there's no way to know, you can feel comfortable buying great AI stocks to gain exposure to the massive potential, but make sure your portfolio is well-diversified with other stocks, too. If you're looking for a top AI stock, here are five great recommendations.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a foundry, which means the company produces the semiconductors that its clients design. It's not developing the AI of the future but plays a key role in making it happen. On top of that, TSMC produces chips for all kinds of companies and technology, and that diversification gives it multiple growth drivers.\n\nEven though TSMC is a well-established industry giant, it's still reporting high growth. In the 2025 third quarter, sales were up 41% year over year, driven by smartphones and autonomous vehicles. The company is also highly profitable, with a gross margin of 59.5% in the third quarter, up from 57.8% last year, and an operating margin of 50.6%, up from 47.5% last year.\nTrading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31, TSMC stock looks very attractive today, and AI tailwinds should push it even higher in 2026.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is mostly known for its Google internet search engine, which has around 90% of global market share. That's an incredible moat, and it's a self-reinforcing moat. More searches give it more data, which the company uses to provide improved products and a better search experience.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is monetizing its user base with a robust advertising business. It uses AI in multiple ways to both increase user engagement with its ecosystem -- making it more attractive to advertisers -- and refine algorithms to get ads in front of the right people. It also offers its Gemini large-language models (LLM) for personal and business use.\nHowever, Alphabet is a lot more than Google these days, with many segments, including YouTube and Android, that diversify its business and make it an excellent stock to own for the long term. It also trades at 31 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is a great entry point.\n\nStory Continues\n3. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the largest cloud services provider in the world, with almost a third of the global market. That gives it an edge in the space, and it's working hard to keep its dominant position.\nCEO Andy Jassy is always talking about the shift from on-premises spend to the cloud and sees a huge change happening over the next 10 to 20 years. That's a long growth runway for Amazon.\n\nThe company plans to spend more than $125 billion on AI development in 2026, more than any other rival hyperscaler. Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth accelerated in the third quarter to more than 20% year over year, and at its size, that's an impressive feat.\nAI is a huge growth driver for Amazon today but the company has a varied business that makes it a strong bet for long-term growth. Amazon stock trades at an attractive P/E ratio of 33, giving it extra room to expand in 2026.\n4. Nvidia Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) growth may be slowing, and as more companies enter the AI development race, it's facing stiffer competition. But there's no question that it has built up a formidable AI platform, with a large array of vertically integrated products its clients are invested in, giving it a leg up on newer options. The company is not letting up on innovation and keeps launching new products with even better technology to protect its moat and industry dominance.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is expensive, trading at 47 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is why the stock will fall if growth begins to decelerate. However, the company is a profit machine, and analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to more than triple through 2028. Nvidia tends to beat on the bottom line, and if it can continue to demonstrate high growth and soaring profits, it should keep beating the market in 2026.\n5. Lemonade Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) is a different type of AI company. It's an insurance company first but has used AI and machine learning from the ground up to create a better system for pricing and handling insurance claims. It has attracted young customers from inception who appreciate its digital technology, and as it becomes more well-known, it's onboarding millions of new customers for all kinds of policies.\n\nThe company has reported strong sales growth from the beginning, and growth has been accelerating. In-force premium, its top-line metric, was up 30% year over year in the third quarter. As its algorithms improve and it scales, Lemonade is also heading toward profitability, and management is expecting to hit adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven this year. If it does, expect the stock to soar much higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Trust Wallet Goes Dark on Chrome – $7M Hack Victims Left Waiting for Claims Tool Trust Wallet’s Chrome extension hack left users in limbo, as a Chrome Web Store bug forced the extension offline and delayed the promised claims tool while Trust Wallet works with Google to fix it.\n\nHassan Shittu\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 12:17 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTrust Wallet users affected by a recent browser extension hack are facing fresh delays after the wallet provider confirmed that its Chrome extension has been temporarily removed from the Chrome Web Store.\nThis resulted in slowing the rollout of a key claims verification tool tied to the incident.\nTrust Wallet chief executive Eowyn Chen said the extension became unavailable after the company encountered a Chrome Web Store bug while attempting to release a new version.\n\nThe delayed update was meant to introduce a verification feature designed to help victims of the Christmas Day hack confirm wallet ownership and submit reimbursement claims securely.\nChen said Google has acknowledged the issue and is escalating it internally, while warning users to stay alert for fake or impersonated versions of the extension circulating online.\nAttackers Exploited Fake Trust Wallet Update to Steal Funds The outage comes as Trust Wallet continues to manage the fallout from a security breach that began unfolding in late December.\nOn December 25, the company confirmed that a malicious version of its Chrome browser extension , version 2.68, had been distributed through the Chrome Web Store outside its normal release process.\n\nThe compromised extension allowed attackers to access sensitive wallet data and execute unauthorized transactions, leading to millions of dollars in losses.\nTrust Wallet’s internal investigation shows that only users who installed version 2.68 and logged into their wallets between December 24 and December 26 were affected.\nMobile app users, users on other extension versions, and those who installed or logged in after December 26 were not impacted.\nThe company said it identified 2,520 wallet addresses that were drained during the incident, with roughly $8.5 million in assets linked to 17 attacker-controlled wallets.\nThe wallet, though, noted that some of those attacker addresses also targeted wallets unrelated to Trust Wallet.\nSecurity researchers later confirmed that the malicious build appeared legitimate and passed Chrome’s review process but contained hidden code capable of extracting recovery phrases.\n\nSeveral users said simply importing a seed phrase into the extension triggered immediate fund outflows across multiple blockchains.\nTrust Wallet Cleans Up Extension Hack; Flags Rise in Fake Compensation Scams Trust Wallet traced the breach back to a wider supply chain attack known as Sha1-Hulud, which surfaced in November and affected multiple companies through compromised developer tooling.\nThe company said exposed GitHub secrets and a leaked Chrome Web Store API key allowed the attacker to upload the malicious extension directly, bypassing internal approval checks.\n\nStory Continues\nIn response, Trust Wallet rolled back to a clean release, published version 2.69, and disabled compromised publishing credentials. It also declared a voluntary reimbursement scheme, which they promised to all those people who were found to be victims.\nOn December 29, it opened a formal claims process, where users are asked to provide wallet addresses, transaction hashes, and identifying information via an official support portal.\n\nIn its response to over 5,000 claims, the company indicated that it has been inundated with claims, given that the number of verified affected wallets is much lower, and it is a cause of concern that there could be duplicate or fake claims.\nIt is the cause of that discrepancy that led to the creation of another verification mechanism that was supposed to be provided with the next update of the browser extension, but was delayed by the Chrome Web Store problem.\nSource: Chainalysis\nThe event continues to add to an increasing number of wallet-related escapades in the crypto industry. Industry data shows that the proportion of personal wallet compromises has continued to increase as the share of stolen funds.\nRead original story Trust Wallet Goes Dark on Chrome – $7M Hack Victims Left Waiting for Claims Tool by Hassan Shittu at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It's helped to carry this market in 2025. I'm curious how you how you see that AI trade and trend evolving in 2026, Tom.\n00:30 Tom\nGood afternoon, Josh. Thank you very much for having me on and happy New Year to everyone. Yeah, so, so we sort of described four pillars of the rally and the most important and first one as you said is AI. and it's really been a rising tide that's lifted all boats, not just this year, but for the past three and a half years, really. But we think that's changing a little bit in 2026. and importantly, it doesn't mean it's necessarily going away, but instead, I think the sort of AI enthusiasm is going to look a lot more like Q4 than it did say Q2 and Q3. and what I mean by that is that it's fractured. So we're not going to have every single tech stock just running away. It's going to become a selection of winners, say like your Micron, and then maybe some losers, like your Oracle and to a point Qualcomm. and I'm not saying to those stocks specifically into 2026, but more as an example that we're going to have to be selective as AI matures.\n01:41 Josh\nWell, let me ask you, if AI is sort of more fractured next year, you know, if I'm a viewer or I'm an investor, I'm listening to that. How do I discern, Tom, then the winners and losers in this AI fractured world you're describing?\n02:00 Tom\nSo for me, I look at AI as sort of a cycle that's maturing, right? And really the first stage was sort of it was it was the epiphany stage, right? Oh my gosh, we can do this. And then in order to do this, the first thing we need is semiconductors. And now we're going to run out and buy all the semiconductors that we can and obviously Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi have benefited fantastically from this. I see it evolving a bit now into those that those companies that are really taking the leading edge. Probably my top AI pick for 2026 is Google. I like Gemini 3. I think their advantage on search gives them a huge uh sort of chip in the game against Open AI. So I like Google from a search standpoint. I also like the memory because that's sort of the next stage of this data center build out, right? We need the compute power. Well now all of a sudden we need all the memory to power all that we need. So I see it more of an infrastructure play evolving uh towards memory on the infrastructure side, but then also from sort of the hyperscalers, I really like Google uh with YouTube and then with Gemini 3.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "'Two Old Dogs Trying To Learn New Tricks' — Dave Ramsey Steps In As $40,000–$50,000 Tax Bill And A 130-Year-Old Farm Trigger A Major Marriage Fight\n\nCasey B. Renner\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 11:01 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nA 130-year-old family farm and a looming $40,000–$50,000 tax bill pushed a routine housing decision into a serious marriage fight. Nearly two years into his marriage, Dan called \"The Ramsey Show\" amid rising tensions over housing and finances.\nAt the center of the disagreement is whether to sell a 130-year-old family farm now and pay an estimated $40,000–$50,000 in capital gains taxes, or keep the land for several more years while purchasing a home another way.\n\nAfter hearing the details, personal finance expert Dave Ramsey said the situation reflected \"two old dogs trying to learn new tricks,\" adding that the issue extended beyond financial calculations.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nA 130-Year-Old Farm And A $50,000 Question The farm in western Kansas, has been in Dan's family for about 130 years and is valued at roughly $300,000. Dan said his accountant estimated that selling it now would result in combined federal and state capital gains taxes between $40,000 and $50,000.\nHis wife prefers selling the land immediately to buy their “forever home” in cash. Dan, however, proposed a complex alternative: keeping the farm for five more years and using the annual income from wheat and milo sales to “bank” the money for the future tax bill.\n\nCo-host John Delony was quick to point out that the tax bill was likely a sign of deeper issues. \"A capital gain sounds like a distraction to me,\" he said, adding that Dan's plan was a \"complex matrix\" of variables like rain and subsidies that only served to delay a difficult decision.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

When combined with the farm equity and $110,000 Dan received from a previous home sale, the couple controls close to $500,000 in assets.

He wants to aggressively pay down the debt, but she prefers that he begin first and plans to join later after seeing results — a dynamic that has turned financial discussions into repeated arguments.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nHave $100k+ to invest?

Because of that, he said, there is no shared legal or financial structure.\n\"You're having an argument with your roommate about how your roommate handles money,\" Ramsey said, stressing that the legal and financial reality does not match the way David describes their situation.\n\nHe said each person has separate legal responsibilities and separate income. Even though David refers to their finances as shared, Ramsey said lenders, employers, and creditors recognize them only as two individuals, not a single unit.\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\"You're trying to pretend like you're married financially when you're not,\" he said, adding that the mismatch creates ongoing strain.\nEight Years Without A Decision \"Eight years is long enough time to paint or get off the ladder,\" Ramsey said, addressing whether the relationship was moving forward in a defined way.\nHe said couples often struggle when they try to coordinate finances without making that call. \"You're going to struggle to prosper relationally until you make that decision,\" Ramsey said, adding that financial progress is also harder when legal responsibilities remain separate.\n\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nDirection Before Debt Math Ramsey said that if marriage is the intended direction, premarital counseling should be part of the process, especially given their different approaches to money. He said couples with contrasting financial styles often succeed when they agree on direction and expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The woman of your dreams could be the woman of your nightmares if she doesn't get on board here,\" Coleman said, warning that misalignment now could create deeper problems later.\nColeman encouraged David to stop trying to convince his girlfriend with spreadsheets and instead cast a clear vision for the future. He suggested framing the conversation around shared goals rather than debt mechanics.\n\nRead Next: Bezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "Berkshire Is Selling Apple Stock and Buying This Other Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 6:27 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Over the last couple of years, Berkshire has reduced its position in Apple stock by more than 70%.\nFor years, Berkshire has been stockpiling cash and collecting interest on Treasury bills.\nLast quarter, Berkshire put some of its excess cash to use and acquired a stake in Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nOver the last three years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a theme so influential that the broader market seems to ebb and flow based on this singular narrative. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices are both hovering near record highs, with megacap technology stocks being some of the largest contributors to the market's ongoing rally .\nWhile just about every major investment fund on Wall Street can't seem to get enough of AI, Berkshire Hathaway 's Warren Buffett -- who just retired as CEO -- has primarily stuck to his contrarian methods. Throughout the AI revolution, Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks -- hoarding cash on its balance sheet and collecting passive income through Treasury bills.\nLast quarter, Berkshire finally put some of its excess capital to use and made a significant addition to its portfolio. Let's dig into some of the fund's moves in recent years and try to make sense of what drove these decisions. From there, we'll take a look at valuation and assess if now is a good opportunity to follow in Buffett's footsteps.\nNo longer the apple of Buffett's eye Berkshire Hathaway has long been a fan of consumer businesses and financial services. For decades, many of the firm's largest positions have included insurance companies and banks, as well as a mix of consumer staples and discretionary brands.\nBack in 2016, Buffett made headlines following Berkshire's purchase of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. Many investors viewed this as a rare instance of Buffett investing in the technology sector. However, given Apple's brand moat, consumer loyalty, robust hardware ecosystem, and steady cash flow generation, the company actually checks off many of Buffett's investment criteria.\nA combination of meaningful price appreciation and subsequent buying over the last decade ultimately turned Apple into Berkshire's largest position. Throughout the AI revolution, however, Buffett has been trimming exposure to the iPhone maker.\nPosition\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nQ1 2025\nQ2 2025\nQ3 2025\nApple shares (in millions)\n906\n789\n400\n300\n300\n300\n280\n238\n\nData Source: 13f.info\nSince the end of 2023, Berkshire has reduced its exposure to Apple by roughly 73%. Many pundits on Wall Street have criticized Apple for being late to the AI market. While I personally agree, I do not think this necessarily played much of a role in Buffett's decision to sell the stock.\n\nStory Continues\nTo me, the rationale behind these sales was more macro-oriented. Since October 2023, both the S&P 500 and Apple stock have risen by about 60% -- an abnormally high return in a rather short period. Buffett has always exercised prudent judgment. I think taking advantage of a frothy market and rotating capital into more passive vehicles seemed like a better deal in the eyes of Buffett.\n\nBillionaires are plowing into Alphabet stock For much of the AI revolution, companies such as Nvidia and Palantir Technologies have been the main attractions. When it comes to legacy internet companies, both Amazon and Microsoft have also become heavily featured in the broader AI discussion.\nOne company that has been relatively quiet for the last few years, however, is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . For a while, the rise of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT were viewed as a knockout punch for traditional search engines -- namely, Google.\n\nBut over the last few years, Alphabet quietly trudged along and built out its AI roadmap. Now, billionaires are finally catching on. During the third quarter, notable investors, including Stanley Druckenmiller, Israel Englander, Ken Griffin, Philippe Laffont, and now Warren Buffett, all poured into Alphabet stock.\nIs Alphabet stock a good buy right now? Alphabet currently boasts a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29. While the time to buy the stock at bargain prices may have passed, there are still plenty of upsides.\nToday, Alphabet has integrated its own LLM, Gemini, into core aspects of its business -- from an overhauled Google search landing page to the company's Android consumer electronics devices.\nIn addition, Alphabet has also invested heavily into its own hardware in the form of custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- integrating this technology into its budding cloud computing platform. Most recently, Alphabet announced a $4.7 billion acquisition of Intersect -- a provider of clean energy power sources for data centers.\n\nBy vertically integrating all aspects of the AI value chain across its ecosystem, Alphabet is positioning itself to emerge as a durable leader of the next technological supercycle. Against this backdrop, I think Alphabet is poised for meaningful valuation expansion over the next several years and see the company as a compelling opportunity to buy and hold for patient investors with a long-term time horizon -- just like Berkshire Hathaway.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $505,641 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,143,283 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 974 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Mark Cuban Warns 4 Key Industries Could Crumble in the Next Recession\n\nMarc Guberti\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 5:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has navigated several recessions and he believes another one is on the way. Job losses translate into lower revenue growth for many businesses, which can cause an economic slowdown, but some industries are at greater risk than others. Here are some of the key industries that Cuban said can crumble in the next recession.\n\nMedia “[The media is] the worst industry in the history of industries,” Cuban said in a YouTube video , adding that artificial intelligence (AI) may only make it worse. Traditional media firms have always fought for people’s attention, since more attention translates into higher ad revenue. However, the media industry has become fragmented and the largest media companies are struggling to compete with TikTok shorts, social media influencers and the endless algorithms of search engines like Google and YouTube.\n\nAI fuels these concerns, making it easier for media companies to blend in with the competition. These risks also extend to Hollywood, since its films and TV shows face more competition from an endless supply of content.\nTrending Now: Here’s How To Use AI To Quickly Start a Side Gig, According To Codie Sanchez\nFor You: 6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nRestaurants Cuban also told investors to steer away from restaurants, saying that they are bad investments, according to MoneyWise . Restaurants are known for having narrow margins and if workers continue to demand higher salaries, it may be more difficult for restaurants to secure the best local talent in a sustainable way.\n\nRising food costs may also lead to more people making food at home instead of commuting to restaurants for more expensive food. Chipotle is a victim of this trend, as its comparable sales increased by only 0.3% year-over-year in the third quarter, according to a news release by Chipotle . Chipotle’s growth rates are normally much higher, but Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright cited “persistent macroeconomic pressures” that are slowing down the industry.\nIndustries That Rely On Government Funding Cuban has regularly criticized DOGE , saying that it attempted to do too much too soon instead of staggering the job cuts. He has expressed caution about relying on government spending and the unpredictability of DOGE adds another layer.\nWhile some corporations only use government revenue as a small piece of total revenue, other companies depend on it. If DOGE turns the faucet off, companies that heavily rely on government spending may struggle to stay afloat.\n\nBusinesses That Depend On Another Company’s Platform Social media and e-commerce platforms can spread the word about your brand and products. Some people do very well due to those platforms’ discovery features, but Cuban said these companies can fall apart in a recession.\n\nStory Continues\n“When I look at investing in companies, if you have any level of dependency on Amazon, it’s a negative,” he said in an X post .\nPlatforms can raise their fees and undercut merchants’ profits at any time and there isn’t much that the merchants can do about it. An economic recession would decrease overall revenue from these platforms and the companies that created platforms may raise their fees to compensate for lower sales volume.\n\nThat’s been happening with Etsy ever since the e-commerce platform’s pandemic boom faded. Gross merchandise sales increased by 0.9% in the third quarter, according to a news release by Etsy , while total revenue increased by 2.4%. Etsy’s revenue growth outpaced its gross merchandise sales because of fees and advertising costs that fall on sellers . Those expenses, grouped under “services revenue,” came to $210 million in additional revenue for Etsy. That figure is up by 12.7% year-over-year, demonstrating how quickly expenses can change for sellers if they rely on platforms.\nIt’s even worse for publicly-traded platforms, since they are obligated to deliver profits for their investors. That resulted in extra costs for sellers and higher fees are a big reason why Etsy saw a 10.9% drop in active sellers. Etsy attributed this drop to its “seller set-up fee implemented in April 2024.” Buyers also dropped by 5%, so it is possible that Etsy raises prices on its sellers again.\n\nThis risk is present for any business that relies on someone else’s platform to attract customers and generate sales. Businesses that are doing well on these platforms today may be extinct within a year due to squeezed profit margins, less love from the algorithm and other factors that are out of their control.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nTrump's $2K Dividend: Who Qualifies and How You'll Get It\nElon Musk Predicts 'Universal High Income' Will Pay For Everything -- How Much Would You Get?\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Mark Cuban Warns 4 Key Industries Could Crumble in the Next Recession\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Invest $1,000 in to Start the New Year Off Right\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nVRTX\n\nENB\n\nKey Points Alphabet should continue to benefit from a strong AI tailwind in 2026.\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has several growth drivers in the new year.\nEnbridge offers stability in the event the economy declines over the next 12 months.\n10 stocks we like better than Enbridge ›\nSome kiss a loved one at midnight on New Year's Eve to usher in a new year on a positive note. In the South, many eat black-eyed peas and greens to hopefully ensure prosperity during the year.\nHowever, I think the best way to begin the new year is to invest. The sooner, the better. But where should you put your money to work for you? Here are my picks for the best stocks to invest $1,000 in to start the new year off right.\n1. Alphabet Companies well-positioned to meet the continued surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products and services should generate tremendous profits in 2026. And I can't think of a more likely AI winner than Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nGoogle Cloud is growing faster than its two bigger rivals, Amazon 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS and Microsoft 's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. Its launch of the widely acclaimed Google Gemini 3.0 large language model (LLM) could attract even more customers.\n\nGemini 3.0 is also improving the generative AI capabilities of Google Search. Rather than being the \"Google killer\" that some predicted, genAI is instead boosting search traffic for Google. That translates to increased advertising revenue.\nI expect that agentic AI will be a key growth driver for Google Cloud in 2026. The integration of AI agents into Google Workspace should also further increase the popularity of the cloud-based productivity suite.\nWill 2026 be the year that Waymo becomes a significant revenue contributor to Alphabet? Probably not. However, I think Waymo's autonomous ride-hailing services will continue to gain momentum over the next 12 months. Forward-thinking investors could increasingly recognize the gold mine Alphabet owns with this business.\n\n2. Vertex Pharmaceuticals One important development to watch with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) in 2026 is the accelerating momentum for its newest cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy, Alyftrek. To be sure, much of Alyftrek's sales will cannibalize sales of Vertex's other CF products. However, because the royalties for Alyftrek are lower, successful commercialization of the drug should boost Vertex's profits.\nI expect that Journavx will also really hit its stride this year. More than 170 million people already have access to the non-opioid pain drug. Vertex believes that access to Journavx will continue to expand in 2026. The greater the access, the greater the sales.\n\nStory Continues\nPovetacicept could be another big story for Vertex in the new year. The company has already begun a rolling regulatory submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for accelerated approval of the drug as a treatment for IgA nephropathy. This chronic kidney disease affects nearly three times as many patients in the U.S. and Europe as CF . Vertex anticipates completing this filing in the first half of the year.\n\nA second potential regulatory filing appears to be off the table for 2026. Vertex previously predicted that it would file for approval of zimislecel in treating severe Type 2 diabetes in the second half of the year. However, dosing in the Phase 3 study of the experimental drug had to be stopped while an internal manufacturing analysis was conducted. Vertex hopes to resume dosing in 2026.\n3. Enbridge Unlike Alphabet and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) isn't a high-powered growth stock. However, I think it's a great pick for 2026 for three key reasons.\nFirst, Enbridge doesn't have to deliver sizzling growth to still deliver strong total returns. The energy company's high forward dividend yield of 5.8% gives it a big head start. What's more, Enbridge has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years.\n\nSecond, the company has exceptional long-term growth prospects. Enbridge estimates roughly $50 billion in growth opportunities through the end of the decade, with nearly half of that total related to its gas transmission business.\nThird, this stock provides stability to investors' portfolios in the event the economy takes a turn for the worse in the new year. Enbridge ranks as the largest natural gas utility in North America and one of the biggest pipeline operators. Its business generates steady cash flow in all business cycles.\nOver the last 20 years, Enbridge has delivered risk-adjusted total shareholder returns that beat the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the utilities sector. That's the kind of stock you'll want to own if the economy struggles in 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now? Before you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enbridge wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Alphabet Inc\n\nGuruFocus News\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2026-01-01, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $270.81. It's currently trading at a price of $313. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -15.58%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$8.67\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.16%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 24.30% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n170.15\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n191.11\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n270.81\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $187.72. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -66.74%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could Spotify Be a Multimillionaire-Maker Stock?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 10:39 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SPOT\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Spotify leads its niche, despite having to compete with some tech giants.\nThe company boasts plenty of growth avenues and a strong competitive edge.\n10 stocks we like better than Spotify Technology ›\nEver since its 2018 initial public offering, Spotify Technologies (NYSE: SPOT) has produced strong returns for its shareholders, well above those of the S&P 500 . It has recorded an average compound annual growth rate of 19.3% through this period.\nHowever, for an investment in the streaming powerhouse to turn average investors into millionaires will take similarly impressive stock market performances across the next couple of decades. Can Spotify pull it off?\nWhat Spotify has going for it Spotify is the leader in the music streaming industry. This is impressive, considering it competes against tech giants such as Amazon , Alphabet , and Apple , all of which can afford to operate their music streaming businesses at a loss due to their large and profitable operations elsewhere. Still, Spotify's strategy has proven highly successful. It has a vast library of artists from record labels with which it has signed deals, so it benefits from strong network effects . The larger its music library, the more attractive its service is to consumers, and the more listeners its platform has, the more appealing it will be to musicians.\nSpotify has continued to post strong revenue growth, thanks to an increasing number of users, a rising number of paid subscribers, and growing ad revenue, which tends to improve as engagement does. All of these are still potential growth avenues. For instance, its premium subscribers are still less than 40% of its total users -- but those paying listeners account for close to 90% of its revenues. Although it is nearing its goal of 1 million monthly active users, it's not there yet.\n\nFurther, Spotify's podcast strategy could pay off in the long run. Although it has spent a small fortune acquiring exclusive rights to famous podcasters' shows, the company is betting that this will attract a larger audience, leading to substantial monetization (through engagement and ads) over the long run. Lastly, Spotify is embracing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), and has implemented AI features across its business, which have helped boost engagement.\nSpotify could remain the dominant player in music (and audio) streaming for a long time and deliver excellent returns along the way.\nMake sure to diversify Someone starting with an initial investment of $30,000 and a 30-year horizon would need a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% to turn that into $1 million. Can Spotify maintain that pace over the next three decades? It would be a tough task for any company. It assumes near-perfect execution for Spotify in a market for music streaming that, although fast growing, is still relatively small. Moreover, from its current market cap of around $119 billion, such gains would turn it into a $3.9 trillion company -- around the same size as Alphabet and Apple. It's hard to imagine the global music industry supporting that kind of valuation for a streamer, even if Spotify came to be the dominant way music and podcasts were delivered. And the reality is that competition from Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and others is likely to persist, which will weigh on the stock.\n\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, although Spotify has been profitable more often than not over the past two years, it still occasionally turns in a quarterly net loss, which is far from ideal.\nAll of these factors could somewhat limit Spotify's upside. But the good news is that near-perfect execution from one company isn't necessary for investors. Turning relatively small investments into a $1 million nest egg is best attempted with a well-diversified portfolio, and even accounting for potential threats, Spotify can contribute to that, as it could generate solid returns over the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Spotify Technology right now?

It is not produced or endorsed by the official Flixy brand. All product names, logos, and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Prices, discounts, and availability are subject to change. Affiliate Disclosure: This article contains affiliate links. If you purchase through these links, a commission may be earned at no additional cost to you.\n\nIf you've seen ads for the Flixy Stick and found yourself typing \"is Flixy legit\" into Google, you're not alone. Search patterns entering 2026 show a significant uptick in consumers researching streaming alternatives — and an equally significant uptick in skepticism about products promising entertainment without recurring fees.\nThat skepticism makes sense. The streaming device market includes everything from established household names to products that don't deliver on their promises. So before spending money on anything, smart consumers do their homework.\nThis release exists to support that research process — pulling together publicly available information about the Flixy Stick so you can evaluate whether it aligns with your specific entertainment needs and expectations.\nView current Flixy Stick details on the official website\nWhy So Many Consumers Research the Flixy Stick Before Buying\n\nHere's what's driving the search volume: industry data indicates American households now juggle an average of 3.4 streaming subscriptions, spending roughly $48 monthly on entertainment services alone. Published surveys suggest 74% of consumers cancelled at least one streaming service in the past year, with cost cited as the primary reason.\nAgainst that backdrop, devices promising access to content without monthly fees naturally attract attention — and naturally attract scrutiny.\nWhen consumers encounter Flixy Stick advertising, search patterns reveal they're looking for answers to specific questions:\n\"Is this company legitimate?\" — Who makes this product? Where are they based? How do I reach them if something goes wrong?\n\"Does it actually do what the ads say?\" — What are the real capabilities versus marketing claims?\n\"What's the catch?\" — If it sounds too good to be true, what am I missing?\n\"What do real people say about it?\" — Beyond the sales page, what are actual experiences?\n\nStory continues\nThese are exactly the right questions to ask. Let's work through them.\nVerifying the Company Behind the Flixy Stick\nFirst things first: who are you actually buying from?\nAccording to the official Flixy website, the product is distributed by UAB Commerce Core , an entity based in Lithuania. The company provides multiple contact channels for customer inquiries:\n\nEmail: support@get-flixy.com\nPhone: +1 (402) 798-4931\nLive Chat: Listed as available through the company website\nThe website also states that purchases include a 30-day money-back guarantee . According to published terms, this allows customers to request refunds within 30 days of delivery if unsatisfied.\nOne detail worth noting for cautious buyers: the company website indicates acceptance of PayPal as a payment method. PayPal's buyer protection policies operate independently of any company-stated guarantees, which some consumers find reassuring when purchasing from less familiar brands.\nBefore purchasing, it's worth reviewing current guarantee terms and return processes directly on the company website, as these may be updated over time.\nReview Flixy Stick company and contact information\n\nWhat the Flixy Stick Actually Does (According to the Company)\nThis is where clear expectations matter most.\nAccording to the company's published materials, the Flixy Stick is a compact streaming device that connects to televisions via HDMI port. Once connected to Wi-Fi, the device provides access to streaming content through its interface.\nThe company describes the following capabilities:\nAccess to free streaming applications and ad-supported content platforms. Screen mirroring from mobile devices to the television. A built-in web browser for accessing online content. Pre-installed casual gaming applications. Compatibility with televisions featuring HDMI ports, which the company states includes most models manufactured after 2003.\nTechnical specifications listed on the company website include:\n\n1GB RAM paired with 8GB storage, which the company describes as supporting smooth application performance. Dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity for streaming. What the company describes as AI-powered content organization that sorts available content based on viewing patterns.\nHere's the critical clarification that prevents misunderstanding:\nThe company's own FAQ section states that premium subscription platforms — Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and similar services — can be accessed through the Flixy Stick but still require their respective paid subscriptions . The device provides a way to access these apps on your television; it does not provide free access to paid content.\nThis distinction is essential. The Flixy Stick value proposition, as the company presents it, centers on consolidating free and ad-supported streaming content through a single device — not replacing subscriptions for premium services.\n\nWhat Real-World Experiences Look Like\nHere's where honest research requires looking beyond any single source.\nConsumer experiences with streaming devices in this category — including the Flixy Stick — vary across independent review platforms and discussion forums. Some users describe satisfaction with basic streaming functionality and perceived value. Others describe experiences that didn't match their expectations based on advertising.\nThese perspectives reflect individual user reports and do not constitute clinical testing or independent product evaluation.\nThis variance is common across the streaming device market and typically reflects differences in:\nIndividual internet connection quality and stability. Geographic location affecting content availability. Specific expectations about what content would be accessible. Technical comfort level with device setup and troubleshooting.\n\nThe most useful approach for prospective buyers involves consulting multiple information sources — not just promotional materials, and not just negative reviews — to develop realistic expectations for your specific situation.\nEvaluate Flixy Stick specifications on the official website\nHow Streaming Devices Differ in What They Prioritize\nNot all streaming devices serve the same purpose, and understanding different approaches helps clarify whether any particular device fits your needs.\nSome streaming devices are designed primarily as gateways to subscription-based platforms. These devices often integrate deeply with specific ecosystems — voice assistants, smart home controls, and curated app stores from their manufacturers. They excel at delivering optimized experiences for consumers whose entertainment primarily comes from subscription services.\n\nOther devices — including the Flixy Stick, according to how the company positions it — prioritize access to free and ad-supported content without ongoing subscription requirements. This approach appeals to consumers specifically looking to minimize recurring entertainment costs or add streaming capabilities to older televisions.\nNeither approach is inherently superior. The right choice depends entirely on your viewing habits, existing subscriptions, technical preferences, and how you want to spend your entertainment budget.\nConsumers evaluating any streaming device benefit from considering factors like content access models, whether ecosystem integration matters for their setup, and how reliant they are on specific subscription services for their entertainment.\n\nFiguring Out If the Flixy Stick Fits Your Situation\nRather than suggesting the Flixy Stick works for everyone — it doesn't, and no product does — here's a framework for evaluating fit based on your specific circumstances.\nThe Flixy Stick might align well with your needs if you:\nPrimarily watch free, ad-supported, or free-tier streaming content rather than paid subscription services. Own an older television without smart features and want to add streaming capability without replacing the TV. Value having a portable device you can move between televisions or take while traveling. Prefer a simplified setup without managing multiple streaming accounts and passwords. Are specifically looking to reduce recurring monthly entertainment expenses.\n\nA different solution might serve you better if you:\nRely heavily on specific premium subscription platforms as your primary entertainment. Want deep integration with voice assistants or smart home ecosystems you already use. Need guaranteed, consistent access to specific content libraries or channels. Prefer purchasing from manufacturers with extensive retail presence and local support options. Prioritize maximum streaming quality with consistent high-resolution performance.\nThe goal isn't to talk you into or out of anything — it's to help you match your actual needs with the right solution, whatever that turns out to be.\nReview Flixy Stick details to assess fit\nHow Setup Works, According to the Company\nThe company describes the Flixy Stick as designed for plug-and-play use. According to their materials, the device connects to a television's HDMI port and draws power through USB connection. On-screen prompts guide users through connecting to Wi-Fi and accessing the content interface.\n\nThe company states no account creation is required to begin using the device, which differs from subscription platforms that require user registration before access.\nUnderstanding Flixy Stick Pricing\nAccording to the company's website, Flixy Stick pricing varies based on purchase quantity and availability at the time of order. The company indicates that multi-unit options may be available, with specific pricing, shipping terms, and any guarantees determined by the brand and subject to change.\nThe website states a 30-day money-back guarantee applies to purchases, though consumers should review current terms directly before ordering to confirm applicable policies.\nFor accurate, current pricing information, prospective buyers should verify details on the official company website, as promotional offers and terms may be updated without notice.\n\nView current Flixy Stick pricing and availability\nPractical Factors Worth Considering\nBeyond product features, a few practical realities merit attention:\nInternet dependency: The Flixy Stick requires Wi-Fi for all streaming functionality. Your experience will directly reflect your internet connection's speed and reliability. Households with limited, inconsistent, or data-capped internet may find streaming devices less practical.\nContent variability: What's actually available to stream depends on factors including geographic location, licensing agreements, and content provider policies. Channel counts and app availability described in marketing materials may not precisely match what's accessible in your specific location.\nPremium services still require subscriptions: This bears repeating — accessing Netflix, Disney+, or similar platforms through the Flixy Stick still requires paying for those subscriptions separately. The device is an access point, not a bypass.\n\nSupport expectations: If issues arise, resolution depends on the company's customer service responsiveness. Keeping documentation of your purchase and any correspondence supports the process if you need to request refunds or resolve problems.\nReaching Flixy Customer Support\nAccording to the company website, support inquiries can be directed to:\nEmail: support@get-flixy.com\nPhone: +1 (402) 798-4931\nLive Chat: Available through the website\nThese channels are listed for pre-purchase questions, order status, and post-purchase assistance.\nVisit the official Flixy Stick website\nDisclaimers\nEditorial Disclaimer: This article provides informational context only and represents independent editorial coverage.

America’s tech moguls were the biggest winners, with a stock market boom in artificial intelligence companies resulting in massive gains.\n\nMore from Robb Report\nBeyoncé Is Officially a Billionaire\nA Miami Manse With a Wraparound Pool and Private Dock Just Listed for $30 Million\nThis New Coffee-Table Book Showcases 100 Rare and Revolutionary Watches\nOf the top 10 richest individuals, the eight in the tech industry added more than half a trillion dollars to their collective wealth in 2025. Tesla founder Elon Musk, currently the world’s richest man , raked in $190 billion in the past 12 months, taking his total net worth to $623 billion, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . He is on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, if Tesla hits the ambitious targets it has set.\nGoogle cofounder Larry Page also had a prosperous year, with a $101 billion gain pushing his personal fortune to $270 billion. Rounding out the top five, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made $16 billion (net worth: $255 billion), Google cofounder Sergey Brin pulled in $92.5 billion (net worth: $251 billion), and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison earned $57.7 billion (net worth: $250 billion). Ellison briefly overtook Musk as the world’s richest man in September, after his business software company reported unexpectedly strong financial results. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also saw his wealth rise $28 billion in 2025, taking his net worth to $235 billion, according to the index.\n\nAmidst all those tech tycoons, luxury’s biggest name sits at seventh in the billionaire rankings. LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault , who has spent his fair share of time at the top of the list , enjoyed a $30 billion gain this year, taking his total fortune to $206 billion. LVMH, which helms the likes of Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., TAG Heuer, and Dom Pérignon, returned to growth in the third quarter of 2025, buoyed by the strong spending of wealthy North Americans.\nArnault sits ahead of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who made $30 billion and $23 billion in 2025, respectively. Huang sold nearly $1 billion worth of shares this year, cashing in on the soaring stock price of the computer chip maker. (Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company in October.)

      "Content": "LIVE\n\nStock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq post double-digit gains in 2025 as AI trade powers market once again\n\nBrett LoGiurato · Front Page Editor\nUpdated Wed, December 31, 2025 at 1:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^IXIC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nGOOG\n\nBTC-USD\n\nStocks fell slightly during the final trading session of an eventful 2025 that saw the S&P 500 clinch a third-straight double-digit gain and the Nasdaq rise more than 20% for the third year in a row.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ), S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ), and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) all lost around 0.7% on Wednesday, dimming hopes of a Santa Claus rally.\nFor the year, the benchmark S&P 500 rose over 16%, marking its sixth year of 15%-plus gains over the past seven. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite paced gains with a 20% rise, while the blue-chip Dow gained roughly 13%.\n\nTech ( XLK ) and Consumer Discretionary ( XLY ) stocks fueled the gains this year over AI optimism. Tech giant Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) outperformed the \"Magnificent 7\" group, rising 65% in 2025. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia ( NVDA ) followed in second place, rising 39%.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%. Gold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year since 1979. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\n\nThe year was not without challenges.\nThe Nasdaq briefly entered a bear market a little over eight months ago, and the S&P stood on the brink of one, after President Trump imposed his most sweeping tariffs in April before largely backtracking.\nWall Street didn't look back from there, despite blips amid concerns over those tariffs, as well as geopolitical developments, the health of the US economy, and — perhaps most of all — soaring AI-fueled valuations .\n\nThe outlook for 2026 calls for more optimism. Every Wall Street forecaster tracked by Bloomberg is predicting that stocks will rally for a fourth consecutive year . But plenty of risks remain: The AI boom could falter, the economy could surprise, and the US president remains a wild card.\nThe Federal Reserve's interest rate path is also in focus into next year, with the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 likely to continue — and with a new chair set to replace Jerome Powell by mid-year. Minutes from the central bank's December meeting , released Tuesday, showed this month's decision was a close call — and that many officials felt it could be \"some time\" before another rate cut. Overall, 85% of bets for January's meeting are on the Fed holding steady at current levels.\nThe stock market is closed Thursday, Jan. 1, and will reopen on Friday.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Could Overtake Nvidia as the Largest in the World in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 12:55 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Nvidia's dominance in the computing world is coming into question.\nTech giant Alphabet might start selling a product to rival Nvidia's.\nIts custom TPUs could replace Nvidia's GPUs in some applications.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nNvidia is the world's largest company at about a $4.6 trillion market cap . It has risen to these lofty heights thanks to huge data centers focused on artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia is projected to have another incredible year in 2026, so knocking it off its perch on top of the world will be no small task.\n\nThere are only a few stocks that have a realistic chance to surpass Nvidia, namely Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Microsoft , which are valued at $4.1 trillion, $3.8 trillion, and $3.6 trillion, respectively. Outside of these, there's a significant drop in companies' valuations that would make the gap too big to close in 2026.\nSo, will any of these three topple the leader?\nThere's only one true candidate to overtake Nvidia Of the three, one stands out as a company that probably will not overtake Nvidia: Apple. Although it's the second-largest company in the world, it doesn't have the growth potential to drive it past the leader.\nApple has struggled to post anything above 10% growth for the last three years, and there isn't a catalyst that will suddenly ramp it up in 2026, either. As a result, I think there's almost no chance Apple can pass Nvidia, unless there is an unforeseen event like a halt in data center construction.\n\nThat leaves Alphabet and Microsoft, and of the two, I think Alphabet has the better chance.\nMicrosoft has a great AI strategy of being a facilitator, rather than a pioneer. However, it doesn't have its own generative AI model. Instead, it allows its clients to deploy whichever model they want. While this is smart from a neutrality standpoint, it could become an issue for Microsoft someday because it doesn't control its own destiny.\nThat leaves Alphabet as the lone remaining company that could topple Nvidia as the world's largest in 2026.\nPassing Nvidia will be no easy task Alphabet entered 2025 with several question marks surrounding its core business, its AI prowess, and what the company may look like in the future. And investors received resolutions on all of these issues throughout the year -- all of them positive.\nGoogle Search, thanks to its AI Overviews, maintained its dominance and has firmly established itself as the go-to search engine. Google Gemini has also emerged as one of the top generative AI platforms and is seen as a growing threat to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Lastly, Alphabet received a positive ruling in a court case seeking to break up the business due to monopoly concerns, and it is free to operate mostly as it did before the court case.\n\nStory Continues\nThis allows the market to value Alphabet for the impressive business it is, rather than needing to include caveats for future events.\nIn 2026, the company could gain ground on Nvidia by beating it at its own game. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are reportedly in talks to sell their custom tensor processing units (TPUs), which can replace Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in some applications. If TPUs become widely available and turn into a popular and cheaper alternative to GPUs, Alphabet could have a brand-new growth division while eating into some of Nvidia's market share.\n\nAlphabet also owns about 7% of SpaceX, which could go public sometime in 2026 at a valuation of over $1 trillion. Still, there's no saying that it would sell its stake even if it did go public. The initial public offering could boost Alphabet's stock, but will it be enough to overtake Nvidia? I'd say no.\nUnless an unforeseen event slows data center capital expenditures significantly, Nvidia's projected growth and profitability will continue to make it the largest company in the world. But if its business is disrupted by alternative chip suppliers, such as Alphabet, its market cap may slip, and Alphabet could easily slide in and take its place.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Could Buy AI21 Next. What Does That Mean for NVDA Stock?\n\nPathikrit Bose\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:36 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAVGO\n\nAfter establishing its dominance in the GPU space with its cadence of chips over the years, chip giant and the world's most valuable company by market cap, Nvidia (NVDA), is slowly making a strategic shift. Following the emergence of Google's (GOOG) (GOOGL) TPU chips in a big way, Nvidia's hegemonic reign at the top of the chip industry was suddenly put into question. However, the Jensen Huang-led company is not doing nothing about it, with the company increasingly turning attention towards the enterprise side and catering to their specific applications. Basically, Nvidia is looking to make a serious splash in the domain of ASICs, in which Broadcom (AVGO) is the biggest player.\n\nRoutine Earnings Beat in Q3 In Q3 2025, Nvidia surpassed its revenue and earnings estimates again. Moreover, both metrics grew at a pace of greater than 50% again in the quarter.\nMore News from Barchart Dear UiPath Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 2\nHow to Buy PYPL for a 29% Discount, or Achieve a 7% Annual Return\nApple is an Analyst Favorite, But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best Play\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWhile the revenues of $57.1 billion for the quarter represented an annual growth rate of 62%, earnings went up by 60% in the same period to $1.30 (vs. the consensus estimate of $1.26). Core data center revenues continued on their sharp upward trajectory in this quarter as well, rising by 66% on an annual basis to $51.2 billion.\nMeanwhile, what helps Nvidia in carrying out these valuable acquisitions is its cash flow prowess, which again witnessed a strong showing in Q3. Net cash from operating activities increased to $23.8 billion from $17.6 billion in the previous year as free cash flow moved higher at an even sharper tick of 65% in the same period to $22.1 billion. Overall, Nvidia closed the quarter with a cash balance of $60.6 billion, with short-term debt of just under a billion on its books. In fact, the cash balance was more than eight times higher than its long-term debt levels of $7.5 billion.\nFor Q4, the company expects revenue to be $65 billion, which would denote an annual growth of 65.4%.\nMeanwhile, despite its stark outperformance over the years, the NVDA stock is up over 40% this year.\nWill AI21 Labs Be an A1 Purchase for Nvidia? Armed with those solid financials, Nvidia is going down a familiar route to gain prominence in a relatively unfamiliar space for the company: acquisitions. While the $20 billion deal to purchase AI startup Groq is hailed as a significant signal of intent from the company to strengthen its footing in inference. Recent reports have emerged that it is looking to buy another AI startup based out of Israel, AI21 Labs.\n\nStory Continues\nA developer of large language models (LLMs), AI21 Labs builds custom generative AI applications for enterprises. Along with Google, Nvidia has also been an investor in the company, which had a purported valuation of $1.4 billion following its latest fundraising round in 2023. Notably, the firm today positions itself as a builder of “frontier” models and enterprise AI stacks rather than a pure consumer app shop, emphasizing secure, customizable on-prem/cloud deployments for customers in regulated industries and ISV partners.\n\nAI21’s product set includes the Jurassic family of LLMs (e.g., Jurassic-1, Jurassic-2), developer APIs (AI21 Studio/Task APIs), user-facing writing tools such as Wordtune, and more recently enterprise orchestration and “AI systems” like Maestro and Jamba that claim to reduce hallucinations and improve long-context performance for document-centric workflows; the company touts architectural work on long-context, task-specific models and tooling for knowledge grounding and retrieval, which it uses to sell higher-margin enterprise deployments. That technical focus gives AI21 a mix of IP in model architecture, inference optimization, and data-centric tooling that appeals to customers who need accuracy, privacy controls, and vertical integration.\n\nSo, how will it help Nvidia?\nWell, for starters, Nvidia will gain access to AI21’s ~200 research engineers with deep LLM and inference expertise, a scarce and strategically attractive commodity for Nvidia’s expanded AI-software push and planned Israeli campus. Further, AI21’s stack for long-context, low-hallucination enterprise inference complements Nvidia’s hardware+software strategy (GPUs + CUDA + Triton) and could accelerate Nvidia’s push into higher-value, software-driven services. Finally, AI21’s direct enterprise contracts and tooling offer a route for Nvidia to monetize more than silicon by selling vertically integrated AI systems. Those three drivers explain why a premium north of AI21’s last public valuation ($1.4 billion) could be defensible to Nvidia.\n\nThus, buying AI21 would accelerate Nvidia’s software/service monetization and deepen its Israel R&D footprint. However, Nvidia should be mindful of the potential integration risks for AI21’s inference stack into its software ecosystem (Triton, TensorRT, NeMo).\nAnalyst Opinion on NVDA Stock Thus, analysts have deemed the stock to be a consensus “Strong Buy,” with a mean target price of $256. This indicates an upside potential of about 36.5% from current levels. Out of 48 analysts covering the stock, 44 have a “Strong Buy” rating, two have a “Moderate Buy” rating, one has a “Hold” rating, and one has a “Strong Sell” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is among the Best Performing Quantum Computing Stocks in 2025 . On December 22, announced the acquisition of Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash. Intersect provides data center and energy infrastructure solutions. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) already owns a minority stake in the company due to a previous funding round.\n\nManagement noted that this strategic acquisition will allow more generation capacity for data centers to come online faster. Moreover, the transaction also includes the team of Intersect and multiple gigawatts of energy and data center projects in development. Management also highlighted that the company will operate separately from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) under the Intersect brand and will be led by Sheldon Kimber. That said, the existing operating assets of Intersect in Texas and its operating and in-development assets in California are not part of this deal.\nIn other news, Wall Street is bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Recently, on December 22, Ronald Josey from Citi reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $343 to $350. Earlier on December 19, Scott Devitt from Wedbush also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $320 to $350.\n\n​​​Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a holding company with major segments including Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

On December 11, Jefferies lowered the firm’s price target on Pattern Group to $20 from $21 with a Buy rating on the shares. The firm’s 2026 outlook suggests being highly selective with Internet equities. Jefferies cites two main headwinds: rising costs that could stall margin growth, and fears that AI will cut out the middleman, making investors less willing to pay a premium for these stocks.\n\nAdditionally, on December 3, Pattern Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRN) announced its acquisition of ROI Hunter, which is a performance-driven retail media platform. ROI Hunter specializes in integrating marketing, product, and merchandising data to facilitate SKU-level advertising decisions. This acquisition is designed to support Pattern Group’s AI-driven capabilities across major walled-garden platforms, specifically Google, Meta, and Snap, by providing a unified source of truth for global brands.\nThe acquisition follows a strong financial period for Pattern Group, where the company reported revenue of $639.7 million in Q3 2025, which was a 46% increase over the previous year. A key driver of this performance was a record NRR of 122%, indicating significant organic growth from existing brand partners compared to 113% in the same period last year.

(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is one of the best stocks for the next decade . On December 22, BNP Paribas Exane reaffirmed its Outperform rating and $355 price target for Alphabet. This sentiment followed the company’s announcement, on the same day, that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Intersect Power, which is a specialist provider of data center and energy infrastructure, for $4.75 billion in cash plus assumed debt. The firm views this move as a strategic step to accelerate the expansion of Google’s global data center footprint and energy generation capacity. The acquisition will not materially impact Alphabet’s financial figures in the immediate term but will strengthen its long-term competitive positioning in the AI sector.\n\nIntersect Power is a leading developer of clean energy and data center infrastructure. The transaction follows a minority investment Google made in Intersect in late 2024 and comes at a time when energy availability has become the primary bottleneck for AI progress. By bringing Intersect’s world-class team in-house, Alphabet aims to bypass the delays of increasingly strained public utility grids. The deal specifically includes Intersect’s massive pipeline of energy parks, integrated sites that co-locate data centers directly with solar, wind, and battery storage. This includes the companies’ flagship joint project in Haskell County, Texas, which is currently under construction as part of Google’s broader $40 billion investment in the state through 2027.\nAlphabet Inc.

      "Content": "An 80% Wipeout Hasn’t Stopped Korean Retail From Chasing Tom Lee’s BitMine\n\nHarsh Notariya\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BMNR\n\nGOOG\n\nCRCL\n\nETH-USD\n\nUSDC-USD\n\nAn 80% collapse would normally mark the end of a speculative trade. In South Korea’s retail-driven crypto ecosystem, it has done the opposite.\nBitMine Immersion Technologies, the Tom Lee–backed US-listed firm that reinvented itself as an Ether hoarding vehicle, now ranks second only to Alphabet among the most purchased overseas stocks by South Korean investors in 2025.\n\nKorean Retail Keeps Buying Tom Lee’s BitMine Even as the Stock Implodes That position has held even as BitMine’s shares plunged roughly 82% from their July peak, wiping out most of the gains from its explosive rally earlier this year.\nAccording to on-chain analyst AB Kuai Dong, despite BitMine and USDC issuer Circle both collapsing more than 70% from their highs, they still landed in the top 10 overseas securities bought by Koreans this year. BitMine sat just behind Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc.\nAt the center of the trade is BitMine’s radical pivot. Once a marginal Bitcoin miner, the company rebranded itself as an Ether treasury, explicitly mirroring the playbook popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, only with ETH instead of BTC.\n\nThe shift briefly turned BitMine into a market phenomenon, sending its shares up more than 3,000% to a July peak. The surge came as retail traders rushed to gain equity exposure to Ethereum accumulation.\nThe hangover was swift. BitMine’s stock collapsed, volatility spiked, and leveraged products tied to the shares cratered. Yet Korean traders kept buying.\nAccording to data from the Korea Securities Depository, cited by Bloomberg, South Korean retail investors invested a net $1.4 billion in BitMine shares in 2025. They even funneled $566 million into a 2x leveraged ETF linked to the stock as losses mounted.\nFaith Capital, Hoarding Logic, and Korea’s Willingness to Buy the Pain To outside observers, the behavior looks irrational. Within crypto-native circles, it follows a familiar logic. Korean community members ascribe it to the “hoarding logic,” arguing that faith-driven capital flows do not track price curves.\n\nStory Continues\nThe idea is that infrastructure matters more than drawdowns. If Ether is a long-term settlement layer, then an ETH-heavy treasury vehicle becomes more attractive as prices fall, not less. Social sentiment mirrors this perspective.\nCircle Becomes the Parallel Bet as Korean Retail Chases Crypto Infrastructure Over Price BitMine is not the only beneficiary of this mindset. Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC, has also attracted heavy Korean inflows.\nKorean investors poured close to $1 billion into Circle shares, making it one of the most popular overseas crypto-linked stocks despite sharp post-IPO volatility.\n\nThis demand likely stems from optimism around stablecoin regulation, both in the US and under South Korea’s new administration, which is pushing to expand domestic crypto market access and allow local stablecoin issuance.\nBeInCrypto reported in October that Circle registered $2.4 trillion in Asia-Pacific stablecoin activity in the June 2024-2025 financial year.\n\nIn Japan, the FSA (Financial Services Agency) approved JPYC as the first yen-denominated stablecoin for launch later this year. Circle invested in JPYC through Series A funding, raising approximately 500 million yen total.\nTogether, BitMine and Circle point to a broader thesis at work. Korean retail investors are not just trading tokens; they are front-running crypto infrastructure through equities, even when price action turns brutal.\n\nMore than $10 billion in overseas equity inflows from South Korea have occurred in 2025. Much of it targeted high-risk themes, including crypto, AI, and semiconductors.\nIs this foresight or normalization of pain? With institutions increasingly bullish on Bitcoin and digital assets heading into 2026, Korean retail may be positioning early for the next cycle. Alternatively, 2026 may redefine drawdowns as an acceptable cost of belief.\nRead original story An 80% Wipeout Hasn’t Stopped Korean Retail From Chasing Tom Lee’s BitMine by Harsh Notariya at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Buffett would go down in history as among the best—if not the best—investors of all time. Known for his value investing credentials and witty quotes, the nonagenarian’s investment principles are followed by many investors, including this writer.\n\nNotably, apart from Abel taking over as Berkshire’s CEO, several other significant changes are underway at the $1.1 trillion conglomerate. Tedd Combs, for instance, has resigned from the company to join J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM), where he will head the $10 billion “Strategic Investment Group.”\nMore News from Barchart Dear UiPath Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 2\nHow to Buy PYPL for a 29% Discount, or Achieve a 7% Annual Return\nApple is an Analyst Favorite, But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best Play\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nBerkshire’s CFO, Marc Hamburg, also intends to retire next year and will be succeeded by Charles Chang, who is currently the CFO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Berkshire has appointed NetJets’ CEO, Adam Johnson, as the president of the company’s consumer products, services, and retailing businesses. The company also got its first general counsel in the form of Michael O’Sullivan.\nBuffett Has Admitted to Making Many Mistakes One of Buffett's hallmarks has been humility, and he has admitted to making many mistakes, which include both omission and commission. He, for instance, regrets not buying Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) early. The investing great has acknowledged that he was wrong about IBM (IBM) and airlines and said that he sold Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL) shares early. He also admitted to overpaying for Precision Castparts and Kraft during the merger with Heinz (KHC).\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire bought 17.8 million Alphabet shares in Q3, which were valued at around $4.3 billion at the end of September. While we don’t know as yet whether the investment decision was taken by Buffett, Abel, or either of Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, the size of the investment seems to suggest that it was either Buffett or Abel.\nWhat Could Change at Berkshire After Buffett’s Departure? There are bound to be changes at Berkshire after Buffett retires as the CEO. However, since he will continue to be the chairman of the board of directors, there will be some continuity. Furthermore, Abel has vowed to preserve the culture at Berkshire that Buffett built over many decades.\n\nStory Continues\nSpeaking at the annual meeting earlier this year, Abel said, “It’s really the investment philosophy and how Warren and the team have allocated capital for the past 60 years.” Abel emphasized, “Really, it will not change. And it’s the approach we’ll take as we go forward.”\nAll said, while it would be fair to expect changes once Abel takes over, we shouldn’t expect drastic changes in the investment philosophy, and Berkshire will continue to practice Buffett’s value investing principles. No one expects Berkshire to go out and start buying bitcoins (BTCUSD) from tomorrow or Abel’s investment philosophy to be closer to Cathie Wood rather than Buffett. However, the recent purchase of Alphabet shares indicates that the company might not be as averse to investing in tech stocks as it was under Buffett.\n\nBuffett Shied Away from Tech Stocks To be sure, Buffett did not hold any grudge against tech companies, and despite selling three-quarters of his Apple stake, the iPhone maker is still Berkshire’s top holding. It was just that he found tech companies to be outside his “circle of competence.” Abel hasn’t publicly talked about investing in tech stocks, but it would be fair to assume that he would take a more constructive approach than Buffett, who was using a flip phone until early 2020. He still doesn't have a computer at his desk in the office.\n\nAbel Could Invest in AI and Tech Stocks if Available at Reasonable Valuations It won’t be an easy task for Abel, though, as valuations of tech stocks are not cheap by historical standards, let alone on the higher (or rather lower) bar that Buffett has set. Meanwhile, while Buffett and Berkshire largely missed the tech boom, Abel now has the opportunity to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) companies. While the current valuations of AI stocks might not seem enticing enough to the new Berkshire CEO, I won’t be surprised to see him use any dips to add positions in tech names.\n\nAll said, despite shying away from tech companies and many admitted “mistakes,” Buffett managed to achieve market-beating returns, which is no mean feat, given that tech stocks have led the market rally this century. Abel has colossal shoes to fill as he takes over the baton from one of the most successful and admired investors of all time. While Berkshire's “circle of competence” might expand, particularly if Abel adds more people to the investment team, it remains to be seen whether he can beat the markets like Buffett did. It won't be prudent to expect the kind of outperformance as we saw under Buffett, as that was a different era and Berkshire was a much smaller company, making outperformance relatively easier. However, while Buffett had a nearly free hand despite periods of underperformance, the incoming CEO might not have that leeway.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: BRK.B, AAPL.

OpenAI's stock compensation accounts for 46% of its $13 billion yearly income, compared to 6% for mature technology businesses. This amount is expected to climb as OpenAI hires more people and accelerates AI model development through 2030.This highlights the fierce rivalry in frontier artificial intelligence, where Meta, OpenAI, and Google (GOOGL) are competing for top researchers.

      "Content": "World's 500 Richest Reach $11.9 Trillion After Record $2.2 Trillion Gain\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nORCL\n\nGOOG\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBloomberg data indicate that the world's 500 richest individuals added a record $2.2 trillion to their collective wealth this year, lifting combined net worth to $11.9 trillion as gains across equities, cryptocurrencies and precious metals supported asset values. The expansion in wealth was supported following Donald Trump's election victory in late 2024, though momentum was briefly interrupted in April when tariff concerns triggered the largest one-day wealth decline since the pandemic. Bloomberg's analysis suggests Big Tech remained a central driver, with ongoing artificial-intelligence optimism supporting US mega-cap stocks and concentrating roughly a quarter of total gains among eight individuals, including Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) chief executive Elon Musk, Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) chairman Larry Ellison, Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) co-founder Larry Page and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, although that contribution was smaller than the year prior.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs ORCL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nBloomberg's wealth index shows Musk began the year as the most prominent figure among global billionaires, though his net worth appeared volatile as political involvement and time spent in Washington coincided with pressure on Tesla shares before a later rebound. The data highlight Ellison as a standout beneficiary of increased AI-related spending, briefly overtaking Musk in September following a sharp rise in Oracle shares linked to its cloud and AI infrastructure investments, even though the stock later retreated roughly 40% from its peak. Outside the United States, Bloomberg data show that wealth gains were broad-based, with the UK's FTSE 100 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng outperforming the S&P 500 through Dec. 30, while strong demand for safe-haven assets supported precious metals and boosted fortunes tied to copper and rare earths amid rising geopolitical significance.\n\nOther asset classes produced more uneven outcomes during the year. Bloomberg data show Bitcoin surged to record highs following Trump's election and the rollout of crypto-friendly policies, before a sharp selloff beginning in October erased those gains and weighed on crypto-focused billionaires including Michael Saylor. The index also highlights sharp reversals tied to company-specific events, including significant losses for property tycoon Manuel Villar after a collapse in Golden MV Holdings shares, and for Venture Global co-founders Bob Pender and Mike Sabel following a scaled-back IPO and subsequent stock decline. In China, Bloomberg data indicate Meituan co-founder Wang Xing saw his wealth fall as weakening domestic demand and intensifying competition offset a strong year for broader Chinese equity benchmarks, underscoring how market momentum in 2025 could be powerful but uneven across sectors and regions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Every fusion startup that has raised over $100M\n\nTim De Chant\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 12 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nBLK\n\nMSFT\n\nCVX\n\nOver the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.\nThe technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.\n\nThe bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances : more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.\nIt doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.\n\nFounders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers , bringing its total raised near $3 billion.\nCFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels.\n\nSparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape , which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.\nThe Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia , and Google has agreed to buy half its output .\n\nStory Continues\nCFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.\nTAE Technologies Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.\n\nIn December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.\nThe fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.\nHelion Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.\nHelion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.\n\nThe company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.\nPacific Fusion Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses . The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.\n\nThe company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech.\nShine Technologies Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.\n\nThe company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\nGeneral Fusion Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.\n\nIn General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.\nGeneral Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff . CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors.\nIn August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported . Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nTokamak Energy Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs.\n\nThe Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.\nIn total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.\nZap Energy Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.\n\nLike Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.\nProxima Fusion Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.\nProxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.\n\nStellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.\nKyoto Fusioneering With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity.\n\nKyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.\nVenture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.\nMarvel Fusion Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience.\n\nThe inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.\nFirst Light Fusion Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite.\nBut even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022 . Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition.\n\nIn March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue.\nBased in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook.\nXcimer Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.\nFounded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.\nThis story was originally published in September 2024 and will be continually updated.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Inside OpenAI's $1.5 million compensation packages\n\nCatherine Baab\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 5:48 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nOpenAI is paying its employees at levels that have little precedent in Silicon Valley history — $1.5 million in stock-based compensation per employee in 2025. That’s according to financial projections shared with investors and first reported by the Wall Street Journal .\nSuch compensation dwarfs what earlier generations of tech giants paid their workforces before going public. Adjusted for inflation, OpenAI's equity payouts are multiples above the norm for large tech firms over the past two decades, and even several times higher than what Alphabet or Meta disclosed ahead of their IPOs.\n\nFerocious competition for AI talent The $1.5 million figure makes clear just how fierce the competition is for top AI talent, with compensation for individual employees beginning to resemble packages that were once reserved for founders .\nAs generative AI models become central to corporate strategy, researchers and engineers with the most relevant expertise are becoming some of the most expensive employees anywhere in the world. To retain current employees and win sought-after job candidates, rival research labs and tech giants must make staggering offers .\n\nA classic example of \"prisoner's dilemma\" In game theory, such a dynamic is known as “ prisoner's dilemma ,” which describes situations in which competition effectively forces participants to escalate costs beyond what any individual would prefer.\nIn this case, if leading AI firms collectively capped compensation, they'd all benefit from lower costs and less-diluted equity. But no single company can afford restraint when competitors are bidding aggressively — not when falling behind in talent means falling behind in the technology itself. The result is a bidding war none of the participants can escape, even as it pushes the economics of AI development into increasingly unprecedented territory.\n\nAccordingly, OpenAI has had to loosen internal equity rules to stay competitive. One recent change removed a waiting period that required employees to stay six months before stock awards began vesting — a nod to a job market where researchers frequently move between companies and can command immediate payouts.\nCompensation now consumes 50% of OpenAI's revenue For OpenAI, this compensation strategy carries steep costs — in several senses. The company has about 4,000 employees at present, and stock compensation now consumes about half of the company’s annual revenue. That’s an unusually high share that likely contributes to operating losses and, at the same time, functions to dilute existing shareholders.\n\nStory Continues\nIn historical terms, the numbers are even more jarring. Among major tech companies that eventually went public, stock-based compensation typically accounted for a modest, single-digit percentage of revenue in pre-IPO years. But at OpenAI, it now approaches 50%.\nWhat’s more, per Wall Street Journal reporting , OpenAI’s investor materials suggest those costs will keep rising for years, even as the company continues to invest heavily in infrastructure and development.\nSo, can it last? Whether the strategy proves sustainable or not, it captures something essential about the contemporary tech economy. The overall pattern is familiar — a handful of firms create world-historical value while a tiny fraction of workers capture most of the gains — but the scale makes earlier booms look quaint. OpenAI is just making the math more explicit and more extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But I think the the the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So, you know, a lot of people should be actually reallocating now. Maybe not today, you know, on a few of the last trading days in the uh in the sessions here, but, you know, from a tax consequence standpoint. But I think, you know, you have an opportunity in the forward, you know, months coming forward here in 2024, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think I think the the point is is that you should. Don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n00:54 Speaker A\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n00:58 Speaker B\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, one out of every 10 years that you know, they've outperformed and we get seven out of 10 on the uh broader markets of out performance. So I like to stay US. So, you know, my thought is is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2024, but, you know, the dollar may, you know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cost average in, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just uh hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In April last year it stopped developing its long-running Wordtune product line, described as an AI-based writing and reading tool used for rewriting and generating text.\nAI21 has since shifted its focus towards specialised language models aimed at corporate clients, rather than mass-market products such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Cloud.\n\nThe company is targeting customers where the consequences of mistakes are higher and dependable, verified information is a priority.\nIts enterprise product is called Maestro and is intended to lift the accuracy of language models by 50%, according to the report.\nIn recent months, AI21 has also introduced a reasoning model it says is faster and more advanced than rival offerings, while using less memory.\nDespite these developments, estimates cited in the report put AI21’s revenue at around $50m, far below competitors that are already generating billions of dollars.\nSeparately, Nvidia is planning an expansion in Israel, including a new R&D campus in Kiryat Tivon, south of Haifa, intended to support up to 10,000 employees.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has said the campus would include up to 160,000m² of office space, parks and shared areas across 22 acres, modelled on its Santa Clara, California, headquarters.\nConstruction is expected to begin in 2027, with initial occupancy planned for 2031.\n\"Nvidia in talks to buy Israel’s AI21 Labs for up to $3bn – report\" was originally created and published by Verdict , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on the year ahead too.\nPowered by the artificial intelligence trade once again, the 2025 financial markets story might seem, on the surface, to be a rerun of what investors lived through in 2023 and 2024.\n\nShine a bit of light on the subject, however, and we see the inner workings of the market's path in 2025 spun an eventful story that won't soon be forgotten.\nDonald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president.\nThe largest company in the world lost nearly 20% of its value in a single day.\nThe S&P 500 registered its worst week since the COVID crash of 2020, crashing 10% in just two days.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%.\nGold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year in two generations. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory Continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

Three of the index’s top 10 performers in 2025 were data storage companies, which are among the main beneficiaries of the hundreds of billions of dollars in pledged spending by the giant AI cloud service providers known as hyperscalers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nOn the flip side, economic uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs weighed on the shares of consumer companies, while health-care stocks struggled with uncertainty surrounding the administration’s policies and pressure on drug prices.\nHere are some of the biggest winners and losers in the US stock market this year.\n\nWinner: New AI Leadership Technology stocks, especially those tied to AI, again dominated the market. But leadership shifted to the shares of companies associated with data — from storage to the building, heating and cooling of data centers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ) Corp., Amazon.com ( AMZN ) Inc., Alphabet ( GOOG ) Inc. and Meta Platforms ( META ) Inc. have pledged to spend more than $440 billion over the next 12 months to build out AI capabilities, benefiting firms such as Sandisk ( SNDK ) Corp., Western Digital ( WDC ) Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc ( STX ), which were three of the four best performing stocks in the S&P 500.\nWinner: New S&P 500 Additions A slew of companies were added to the S&P 500 in 2025, including Robinhood ( HOOD ) Markets Inc., Sandisk, AppLovin ( APP ) Corp. and Carvana ( CVNA ) Co., all of which posted triple-digit percentage gains and landed among the top 20 performers in the index.\nOf course, not every stock that joined the S&P 500 got a boost. Trade Desk ( TTD ) Inc. shares were the worst performers in the index with a nearly 70% loss, while Block ( XYZ ) Inc. tumbled more than 20% and Coinbase ( COIN ) Global Inc. sank more than 6%.\n\nWinner: Palantir Palantir ( PLTR ) Technologies Inc. shares are set to notch a triple-digit gain for the third year in a row. The software developer got a boost from AI enthusiasm and strong buy-in from retail traders who are drawn to the company’s outspoken Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp.\n\nBut the stock is now rather pricey. With a multiple of more than 180 times forward earnings, it’s the third most expensive member of the S&P 500 behind Tesla Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWinner: Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ) soared almost 175% in 2025 on the strength of takeover speculation. The company formally put itself up for sale in October, and there’s an ongoing battle between the top two bidders, Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) Corp. and Netflix ( NFLX ) Inc., with both suitors jockeying to strengthen financial backing for their offers.\nThe Warner Bros. board prefers the Netflix bid and is reportedly planning to reject Paramount’s offer, but Larry Ellison, the billionaire chairman of Oracle Corp. and father of Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison, is personally guaranteeing the Paramount proposal.\nLoser: Consumer Staples Economic uncertainty, tariffs and concerns about the health of the US consumer as inflation creeps higher weighed on consumer stocks, especially some major staples names. Clorox ( CLX ) Co., frozen french fries maker Lamb Weston ( LW ) Holdings Inc., Campbell’s ( CPB ) Co. and beverage giant Constellation Brands ( STZ ) Inc. were among the 20 worst-performers in the S&P 500. Shares of fast-casual dining brand Chipotle ( CMG ) Mexican Grill Inc. sank nearly 40% after two years of double-digit gains.\n\nLoser: Retail The same economic uncertainty also hit shares of some retail companies. Deckers ( DECK ) Outdoor Corp., which owns brands such as Hoka and Ugg, was down almost 50% in 2025, snapping a nine-year streak of gains. The stock was hit hard by a few weak earnings forecasts and analyst downgrades.\nLululemon ( LULU ) Athletica Inc. shares are set to fall nearly 45% this year, their second consecutive double-digit annual decline, as the athletic apparel retailer struggles through an overhaul after a period of slow growth and the recent exit of its chief executive officer. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in the company.\n\nLoser: Managed Care Health insurance stocks underperformed in 2025 despite hopes that the group would benefit from a shift in policy by the Trump administration. Molina ( MOH ) Healthcare Inc. shares were down more than 40%, their second straight year of double-digit declines.

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:59 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nFor Immediate Release\nChicago, IL &ndash; December 31, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL, NVIDIA NVDA and Tesla TSLA.\nGoogle's AI Renaissance (Growth Story Is Far from Over)\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others.\n\nIn the online search arena, Google has a monopoly accounting for roughly 90% of the online search volume and market share. Over the years, the company has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\nAI Cannibalization Fears Overblown\nAlphabet&rsquo;s dominant search market share and expanding cloud footprint are key growth drivers for the company. Initially, Google&rsquo;s AI efforts got off to a shaky start. For instance, in Google&rsquo;s first version AI model named &ldquo;Bard,&rdquo; searches often were completely inaccurate.\nMeanwhile, it appeared that ChatGPT and other models were running away with the AI race. However, several iterations later, and Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.5 AI delivers some of the most rapid responses in the industry and is viewed as an industry standard.\n\nInvestor fears about cannibalization of the search business are unfounded. In fact, Google&rsquo;s unique hybrid AI search model has driven popularity among younger users. Gemini models are being rapidly embedded across Search, YouTube, Android, and Workspace, enhancing user experience and driving internal productivity (e.g., coding, customer service).\nGoogle&rsquo;s Groundbreaking TPU\nGoogle has constructed its own chips to power AI bots. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built to dramatically accelerate machine learning (ML) tasks, especially large-scale training and inference for models like Google's Gemini, powering Search, Photos, and more, available via Google Cloud and functioning as a core component of Google&rsquo;s AI Hypercompute system.\n\nA TPU board fits into the same slot as a hard drive on the massive hardware racks inside the data centers that power Google's online services, the company says, adding that its own chips provide \"an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning\" than other hardware options. TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation.\"\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Gloud: A Consistent Growth Engine\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. In third-quarter 2025, Google Cloud revenues increased 33.5% year over year to $15.16 billion. Google&rsquo;s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics, and AI are positive. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, along with the growing number of data centers are helping Google expand its cloud footprint worldwide.\n\nAlphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA&rsquo;s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3, and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and the low-code Agent Designer tool.\nAd Business & YouTube Drive Top Line Growth\nAI is improving ad targeting and effectiveness, making the core business more resilient and profitable even with AI challengers. Meanwhile, YouTube continues to perform exceptionally well, acting as another strong pillar for revenue growth (especially the short-form video side). Zacks&rsquo; Consensus estimate sees double-digit top-line growth for the full year 2026.\n\nFuture Growth: Waymo Robotaxis\nWaymo is completing over 450,000 paid robotaxi rides per week across its operating areas, including Phoenix, LA, SF, and Austin. Reports from late 2025 indicate significant volume, a substantial increase from earlier in the year, with goals to reach 1 million weekly rides by late 2026. While I believe Tesla is poised to win the robotaxi race due to its scale and costs, there will likely not be one winner-takes-all and Waymo will have a significant chunk.\nBerkshire Hathaway Buys Alphabet\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently made a significant surprise investment, buying a $4.3 billion stake in Google's parent company, Alphabet, during the third quarter of 2025, marking a major tech bet for the value investor, likely driven by Alphabet's strong market dominance in search, its lucrative ad network, and potential in AI, despite Buffett's usual tech hesitation.\n\nGOOGL Has a Reasonable Valuation\nGoogle consistently has among the lowest P/Es among the Mag 7 stocks. With a P/E of 30x EPS, it&rsquo;s reasonably priced and unsurprising that Buffett wants a piece. Additionally, the company has about $100 billion in cash and only $20 billion in debt. The strong cash balance provides the flexibility required to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise.\nStrong Trend & Technicals\nGOOGL shares have outperformed the general market indices and trended higher all year in a stair-stepping fashion. Investors can use the intermediate 10-week moving average as a trend guide.\nBottom Line\nAlphabet remains one of the most strategically positioned companies in technology, combining dominant search economics, accelerating cloud momentum, and expanding AI-driven fundamentals.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Is Alphabet Stock a Buy for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet's stock entered 2025 at an undervalued level.\nA host of concerns were hanging over the tech giant a year ago.\nAlphabet's generative AI offerings have grown in popularity.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nFew stocks have had as successful a 2025 as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) has. It rose by around 65% for the year, and a performance like that likely won't be repeated in 2026. The question is, can we expect Alphabet's next year to be good enough to warrant owning it over other tech stocks, or the market in general?\nAlphabet answered a lot of questions in 2025 Entering 2025, Alphabet was an unloved stock. Three primary questions surrounded the company:\nWill it ever emerge as an artificial intelligence (AI) leader?\nWill Google Search maintain its dominance?\nWill Alphabet be broken up for operating an illegal monopoly?\nAll of those questions had serious implications on the perception of the stock, and it was widely believed that they wouldn't all have answers that were good for Alphabet. But that belief was wrong.\n\nIts generative AI model, Gemini, has emerged as a top option in the space and is growing in popularity. Google Search added AI Overviews and AI Mode, providing users with both traditional search results and generative AI-powered answers. This kept Google Search at the top of its niche, and there's no longer a feeling that it will be disrupted. Lastly, though the judge in Alphabet's antitrust case did find it was acting as an illegal monopoly in the online search space and used that position to hinder competition, he chose not to require the company to spin off parts of itself. Although Alphabet has to make some business changes, the judge allowed it to keep operating mostly as it has been.\nThe positive resolution of all three of these questions kick-started an impressive rally in the stock. However, a lot of its gains for the year were set up by its previous undervaluation.\nAt their low point in April, Alphabet shares could be scooped up for less than 14 times forward earnings. Even after the court case was resolved in September, Alphabet's stock could be purchased for less than 20 times forward earnings. However, today, its stock trades at about 30 times forward earnings. That's around where other big tech stocks commonly trade. While that may mean it's more fairly priced, it likely limits the level of returns that investors will see in 2026. Don't expect another 65% rise.\n\nHow will Alphabet's stock do in 2026? Shareholders will be looking for a few things from Alphabet in 2026. First, they'll want to see the continued dominance of Google Search and Gemini. Those businesses will need to keep excelling for the stock to perform well.\n\nStory Continues\nNext, investors will want to see Alphabet sell some of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to external customers. So far, it has installed all of the custom AI accelerator chips it has produced in its own data centers, where it rents them to cloud customers and uses them to support its own AI workloads. But there have been reports that it is considering a deal to sell a large number of TPUs to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . A deal like that could challenge Nvidia , with its (NASDAQ: NVDA) supremacy in graphics processing units. It would also open up a new revenue stream for the company, potentially allowing it to outperform its peers.\n\nGoogle Cloud, Alphabet's cloud computing unit, will remain a key segment to watch. It has consistently grown its revenues by 30% or more year over year, making it one of Alphabet's fastest-growing divisions. Maintaining that type of pace will be key to the company's success in 2026.\nAnother factor that could boost Alphabet's stock performance in 2026 would be a SpaceX IPO. SpaceX is rumored to be targeting a valuation of over $1 trillion when it goes public, which would make Alphabet's roughly 7% stake in the business worth in the general vicinity of $70 billion. If it chooses to sell its stake, that could provide it with a cash infusion during a critical period of its AI buildout. However, there's no guarantee that SpaceX will go public next year, nor that it will achieve (or maintain) that valuation.\n\nWhat Alphabet needs to do to have a successful 2026 is continue doing what it did in 2025. That's essentially what Wall Street thinks will happen. The analyst consensus projects 14% revenue growth in both 2025 and 2026. I think that growth in the mid-teens percentage range is a fair expectation. That would be greater than the long-term annualized performance of the S&P 500 , which makes Alphabet a solid stock pick for 2026. However, I think some other big tech stocks (like Nvidia) could outperform it. But I also think Alphabet is a safer bet to deliver outperformance, and offers a nice balance of risk and reward for investors.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

The firm is backed by billionaire Peter Thiel and headed by Tom Lee , a Wall Street forecaster known for crypto bullishness.\nThe buying has not been limited to the underlying shares. South Korean traders also sought even higher-octane exposure through T-Rex’s 2X Long BitMine Daily Target ETF, a leveraged product targeting twice the stock’s daily performance.\n\nInvestors have funneled $566 million into the ETF, which is down roughly 86% from its September peak.\nBitMine’s appeal is tied to its balance sheet. The company holds about $12 billion worth of ether, making it the largest digital-asset treasury company dedicated to ETH, according to data compiled by strategicethreserve.xyz.\nEther itself is down about 11% in 2025, according to CoinDesk market data , after the wave of listed accumulators helped push the token to a record near $5,000 in August before the rally faded.\nFor Korean retail traders, the attraction is less about stable exposure and more about convexity. Ether treasury firms trade like amplified ETH proxies, with equity risk layered on top of crypto volatility.\nThat structure creates sharp upside during momentum phases, and equally sharp drawdowns when flows reverse, but it also explains why the stock remains a magnet for South Korea’s high-risk “ant” investor base even after an 80% fall.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The chip giant's rise to this milestone has been deserved, as its business has been growing at a remarkable pace on the back of the fast-growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips deployed in data centers.\nHowever, a few factors have weighed on Nvidia stock since it hit that mark a couple of months ago. The chip designer has lost 8% of its value after hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29. Investors have been worried about the viability of debt-fueled AI infrastructure investments, as well as the returns that the huge spending on AI could deliver for the key names in this space.\nThe good news is that Nvidia could overcome these headwinds in 2026 and jump significantly . The stock's 12-month median price target of $250 suggests that it can rise 31% from current levels by next year, which will be enough for it to reclaim the $5 trillion market-cap level once again (it currently has a market cap of $4.64 trillion).\n\nInvestors, however, would do well to take a closer look at another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that looks all set to achieve a $5 trillion market cap in 2026 -- Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Below, I'll look at the reasons this technology giant is capable of hitting that target in the new year.\nAI is going to be a bigger catalyst for Alphabet in 2026 Alphabet is the third-largest company in the world, as of this writing, with a market cap of $3.8 trillion. The stock, therefore, needs to appreciate by another 32% to reach a $5 trillion market cap. It could easily jump by that much in the new year when you consider its full-stack approach to delivering AI tools and services to customers.\n\nWhile Nvidia is primarily in the business of selling AI chip systems powered by its graphics processing units (GPUs), Alphabet offers multiple customer-facing AI apps and tools. These include chatbots, AI-equipped search features, advertising solutions, and AI-focused cloud computing tools, powered by both in-house chips and external processors -- such as those from Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet's diversified presence across multiple AI niches means it's better positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of AI. For instance, the adoption of AI in the advertising space is anticipated to grow at 28% a year through 2033, generating almost $82 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. Additionally, the overall digital-advertising market that Alphabet serves is likely to cross $1.1 trillion in size by the end of the decade.\n\nAlphabet's AI-focused ad tools should allow it to corner a sizable chunk of this massive addressable market. That's because AI-powered advertising is helping advertisers and brands enjoy higher returns on investment. According to media audience measurement firm Nielsen, AI-enabled video ad campaigns on YouTube are driving a 17% increase in advertisers' returns.\nOther AI-enabled advertising tools from Alphabet, such as Performance Max, Broad Match, and Demand Gen, are also driving double-digit growth in advertisers' returns, apart from driving higher conversion rates when compared to manual ad campaigns. As a result, there's a strong possibility of an acceleration in Alphabet's advertising growth in the future.\nAt the same time, the Google Cloud business is gaining solid traction. That's not surprising, as Alphabet points out that customers using its Google Cloud AI solutions are witnessing a terrific average return of 727% in just three years. Businesses using its cloud AI tools can expect a payback on their investment in around eight months and witness a significant increase in employee productivity.\n\nAll this explains why Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue jumped by 34% year over year in the third quarter to $15.2 billion. That was faster than the 28% year-over-year increase in the overall cloud market's revenue in Q3, indicating that the tech giant is now gaining market share. What's more, Google Cloud's backlog increased by a whopping $49 billion on a sequential basis in the previous quarter to $155 billion.\nAs such, there's a solid chance of Alphabet's growth rate accelerating in 2026, and that should be enough for it to enter the $5 trillion club.\nWhy a $5 trillion market-cap milestone looks like a possibility Analysts are expecting a 14% increase in Alphabet's top line in 2025 to $400 billion. That's almost in line with what it reported in 2024. It's worth noting that Alphabet's revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026 have jumped higher of late.\nConsensus estimates are projecting another 14% jump in the company's top line in 2026, as evident from the chart above. However, the improving backlog in the cloud business, the growing adoption of its AI offerings such as Gemini, and the boost that advertisers are getting from Alphabet's AI tools could help it grow at a faster pace.\n\nLet's assume Alphabet's revenue growth accelerates to 20% in 2026; its top line could jump to $480 billion. If it maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 10 after a year, its market cap could get close to $5 trillion.\nOf course, you may think that Alphabet is falling slightly short of that mark. However, the market could reward it with a higher sales multiple owing to its accelerating growth, which should be enough for it to achieve the $5 trillion milestone.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

But it will likely face more competition too, especially from Tesla ( TSLA ). Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports on what lies ahead for Waymo.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nLet's talk about robotaxis because you think that 2026 could actually be a big year for one of Tesla's biggest competitors and that's Google's Waymo. So break down why is 2026 going to be such a big year?\n00:10 Pras\nYou know, starting off anecdotally, right? I was just in Austin, Texas for the for the holidays and they are everywhere. Waymos are everywhere, dropping people off, picking people up.\n00:20 Speaker A\nPeople are using them. It's easy.\n00:21 Pras\nYeah, I must have seen about 100 and I saw one Tesla robotaxi, right?\n00:25 Speaker A\nOh wow.\n00:25 Pras\nNow, now that's that's because\n00:26 Speaker A\n100 though. That's that's unlike what you're seeing here in the northeast.\n00:29 Pras\nWell, well not yet, right? Um so so then and then they've been in LA. I was in LA this past summer, they're all over LA. So they've really grown in the spots that they're actually operating, which is San Francisco, Phoenix, LA, Austin, and Atlanta, right? They're operating these areas without safety drivers. completely. there's no one in the car. It's just an empty car driving around. So, they're actually doing it and they're and they're charging for it, right? Uh they're going to in 2026 they're going to expand to Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Orlando with full service expected in the early 2026, and they're testing in Detroit, DC, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis.\n01:05 Pras\neven New York City, London and Tokyo, they're testing there. We'll see if that happens. But you know, very deep deeply populated urban areas that's really tough for excuse me robotaxis. So, that's happening.\n01:18 Pras\nNow, by the numbers. Uh right at the end of this year, Waymo was at 250,000 trips a week, right?\n01:24 Speaker A\nWow.\n01:25 Pras\nThey want to do an and sorry, and 20 million for the entire time they've been operating. They want to do million rides a week now by the end of the year.\n01:31 Speaker A\nNow and is this doable. Do you think they can do it?\n01:32 Pras\nSo at the end of next year. So that's four times.\n01:34 Pras\nI mean if if the if the deployments go well. Uh now you mentioned, can they do it? That's a good question because they have to increase production on their cars. They're building their their their EVs with the Jaguar I-PACE and the a Zeekr, Chinese model. But that costs money. And they don't have Tesla's ability to just crank out cars, right? So that's a potential headwind. Uh secondly, what about regulations and safety? Uh you know, sometimes some many municipalities don't want to have that. Or you have a big sort of safety issue like like Cruise did in San Francisco and that just knocks them out of the game. So those are some of the headwinds that they're facing. But\n02:04 Pras\nthat aside, 2026 could be a big year for them.\n02:07 Speaker A\nYeah, and you did mention your story that's now on Yahoo Finance's site that Tesla operates its ridehailing service with safety occupants still. And they're and only in Austin and San Francisco and that's since mid 2025. So it seems like even though there was so much excitement especially around June for Tesla's robotaxis, it seems like they're behind the game compared to Google's Waymo.\n02:24 Pras\nYeah, yeah, I mean and and the number of vehicles is actually pretty low too, right, compared to what Waymo is doing. They now Tesla says they're going to expand to to Las Vegas. I'm sorry, I'm sorry Nevada and then also Phoenix. That's the next the next spots for them. Um and then people like Ives think that's going to be 30 more markets by end of next year. I think that's overly optimistic because we haven't even heard what the next markets are. They haven't even pulled a safe driver out of the in Austin and San Francisco yet. So, a lot of big ifs there, but of course that's the sort of the big payoff if they actually do it.\n02:47 Speaker A\nRight. Wedbush's Dan Ives always bullish on Tesla, though. Pras Subramanian, thank you so much for joining me in studio. Appreciate it.\n02:51 Pras\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Here's My No. 1.\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 12:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet is the most important internet company in the world.\nThe cloud computing segment grew by more than 30%.\nAlphabet has a massive opportunity with its Tensor Processing Units.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" grouping of stocks represents seven of the biggest and most influential companies in the world that make up roughly one-third of the market cap-weighted S&P 500 . Its members have a significant impact on whether the overall stock market rises or falls in a given day, so they are closely watched by both analysts and retail investors.\n\nIn a series of articles, I've been looking at each of these companies to predict which is the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026. And while I'll reveal the full rankings later in this piece, it's time to unveil the legendary company that tops the rankings and appears to be in the best position as we head into the new year.\nLet's pull the curtain back on my No. 1 pick: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nAbout Alphabet stock Alphabet is probably still better known as Google, and for good reason. Google has an unshakable lead in global internet search, with 89.9% of the market share. The search engine in second place, Bing, has just 4.2%. And Alphabet's Chrome browser is nearly as dominant with 71.2% of the market, topping second-place Safari with 14.3%.\n\nThis means that Alphabet is unquestionably the most consequential internet company in the world. And it gives it a massive advantage, both in selling advertising and pushing content to prime locations on the web.\nAlphabet brought in $74.18 billion in revenue during the third quarter from advertising, which includes Google Search, its Google network, and YouTube. That's a 12.6% increase from a year ago, made possible by Alphabet's use of powerful AI tools. For instance, Alphabet uses AI to provide more relevant answers to search queries and also launched an AI Overviews feature that appears at the top of a search result. It also uses AI to optimize the creation and placement of advertising, and even has AI tools to help users answer their email.\n\nIn all, advertising made up 72% of Alphabet's $102.34 billion in revenue for the third quarter, helping it achieve an incredible $73.55 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.\nAlphabet is making huge strides in cloud computing As dynamic as Alphabet's advertising business is, I think the cloud computing opportunity is even greater. Google Cloud is only third by market share with 13%, trailing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, but it's seeing substantial growth. Google Cloud generated $15.15 billion in revenue in the third quarter, up 33% from a year ago. It was also responsible for $3.59 billion in operating income, up from $1.94 billion a year ago.\n\nStory continues\nFinally, Alphabet has a big opportunity with its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are its in-house alternative to Nvidia 's vaunted (and expensive) graphics processing units (GPUs). Alphabet's TPUs aren't as versatile as GPUs, but they are effective in training its AI models. Now Alphabet is reportedly discussing a deal that would sell billions of TPUs to Meta Platforms and it has a deal with Anthropic, which announced it will expand its use of Google Cloud to include up to 1 million TPUs.\n\nCoupled with Google's massive advertising business, the fast-growing cloud opportunity makes Alphabet even more formidable -- and attractive for investors as we head into 2026.\nWhy Alphabet is No. 1 Alphabet shares are up more than 60%, but the company is still reasonably priced. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29.7 remains one of the lowest in the Magnificent Seven.\nRevenue estimates for next year of $454.8 billion have climbed steadily over the last six months, as the market begins to realize the massive potential of Alphabet stock.\n\nWhile this company may not be the flashiest in the Magnificent Seven -- I would give that crown to either Nvidia or Tesla -- I think it's a no-brainer for any investor to buy right now.\nThe list in review Now we finally have the full list, in order:\nNo. 1 Alphabet is the dominant internet company on the planet and is starting to market its alternative to Nvidia GPUs.\nNo. 2 Nvidia is the largest company in the world by market capitalization and has taken the leading role in providing high-powered GPUs to data centers, powering the AI revolution.\nNo. 3 Meta Platforms shifted its attention away from the metaverse and is now focused on developing \"personal superintelligence\" through AI.\nNo. 4 Microsoft has powerful revenue streams through its cloud computing division and its profitable suite of software, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.\nNo. 5 Tesla aims to make breathtaking advancements in autonomous driving, which, if successful, will enable hundreds of thousands of Teslas to be used as robotaxis.\nNo. 6 Amazon is the globe's biggest provider of cloud computing, but is hampered by the comparatively low margins of its legacy e-commerce business.\nNo. 7 Apple isn't monetizing AI like its Magnificent Seven peers, but it's developing advanced chips to run large AI models on its products.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with any of these companies. However, I believe Alphabet is the clear winner for investors seeking to purchase a Magnificent Seven stock for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "What Are the 2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia remains the king of AI infrastructure, and its recent acquisitions only add to its strength.\nAlphabet benefits from being vertically integrated and controlling the whole tech stack.\nBoth stocks are reasonably valued given their growth rates and opportunities.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to be the biggest driving theme in the market today, and there is little reason to think that this won't continue. Demand for both AI infrastructure and services appears insatiable, and it still looks as if we're still in the very early innings of this trend.\nAgainst this backdrop, let's look at the top two AI stocks to buy right now.\n1. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king of AI infrastructure, and the company's recent acquisitions have made it even stronger. It's best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) , which provide the processing power for the majority of AI workloads. GPUs are particularly dominant in large language model (LLM) training, where the company's CUDA software platform adds to its wide moat. Nearly all foundational AI code was written on CUDA, and that code only works natively with Nvidia's chips.\n\nWith its recent acquisition of SchedMD, Nvidia has only expanded its software moat. SchedMD is the developer of Slurm, an open-source software platform that helps manage GPUs by determining which tasks they perform and when. With this acquisition, Nvidia now controls the primary orchestration platform for AI chips. While it says it will keep Slurm open-source, its control over the platform will allow it to more tightly integrate it with CUDA to offer an even more seamless experience.\nThen, on Christmas Eve, the company acquired top talent from Groq and signed a licensing agreement with the company for its technology. The deal essentially gives Nvidia access to Groq's language processing units (LPUs), which are specialized chips designed specifically for AI inference. Demand for AI inference processing is eventually expected to become larger than demand for training, so this deal can be viewed as Nvidia playing both offense and defense to get ahead of that shift.\n\nOverall, Nvidia remains the company best positioned to profit from the continued AI buildout, and its recent acquisitions only strengthen its position. The stock is also reasonably valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 25, based on analysts' estimates for its fiscal 2027, which will begin in late January 2026.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is arguably the best positioned AI company because it is the only one not reliant on Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile other companies are working on designing their own custom AI accelerator chips, Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are now in their seventh generation and have been battle-tested by running Google's workloads for more than a decade. Those years of experience aren't something that its competitors can easily emulate.\n\nAs such, the company enjoys a big structural cost advantage in both AI training (having trained its world-class AI model Gemini) and inference relative to companies that rely largely on Nvidia for chips. Its TPUs have proven so good that Anthropic signed a large deal with Alphabet to deploy TPUs to power its AI workloads. Morgan Stanley estimates that for every 500,000 TPUs that Alphabet rents out, it generates around $13 billion in revenue.\nAlphabet's other advantage over its cloud computing competitors is that it owns a world-class LLM that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. First, this lets it capture more cloud computing revenue by offering its own model. Second, it can monetize its AI model more readily by integrating it into its products, including Google Search, its Android operating systems, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and its workplace productivity tools. With lower costs for training and inference, as well as more platforms upon which it can deploy and monetize its models, Alphabet holds significant advantages over OpenAI and other LLM developers.\n\nAs the most vertically integrated AI company, Alphabet is in a strong position, and its advantages should only widen in the coming years. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, trading at a forward P/E of 28.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "What the Buffett Indicator says about the bull market, AI trade\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST\n\nIn this video: ^DJI\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\n^IXIC\n\n^GSPC\n\nAfter 60 years at the top of one of the world's biggest investment firms, Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK-A , BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett will be handing off the leadership reins to Greg Abel at the end of 2025. The Oracle of Omaha was also noted to have invented the Buffett Indicator, which assesses the valuation of the stock market by dividing the total value of US stocks with the total US GDP (gross domestic product).\n\nYahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma weighs in on how much longer the Buffett Indicator may be calling for a continued bull market, while Miramar Capital Co-Founder and senior portfolio manager Max Wasserman comments on his outlook on the AI trade when factoring in Warren Buffett's market formula.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian\nI have this story on this Buffett indicator now in Yahoo Finance and I was chuckling a little bit as I put it together because that it has been overvalued for years, uh especially the past two years and I I came away thinking this indicator, we're showing there on the screen what it's all about this Buffett indicator, could stay overvalued for more years.\n00:22 Speaker B\nBrian, we had a guest on a stocks and translation yesterday, the podcast of Yahoo Finance. And when we spoke to this guest, she was largely saying that if you take a look just at valuation over the past three years and you didn't choose to jump into the market, then you would have missed out on this three-year bull run. Many expecting that next year could be the fourth year of this bull market that we've seen so far. And so while yes, the Buffett indicator is overvalued, many are saying that this market, the valuations are too high. If you missed out over the past three years, then you missed out on this three-year run and what could be another fourth year of the bull market that we've seen. And also we're hearing so much uh from different uh outlooks for 2026 about where exactly the S&P 500, even as high as 8100 is one-year end target for 2026. And so more momentum is expected to come. And so yes, there are high valuations right now, but what we've seen over the past few few years is really these continued momentum proving that overvaluation saga wrong.\n01:21 Brian\nMax, I love this on the notes that uh you sent over to us. You said you were very cautious on the Open AI trade. And I thought, well, does that mean investors should be betting against AI stocks at this point?\n01:40 Max\nWell, I don't look at investing as betting, but I think they have to be aware of where they're going to get the returns. So, yes, I'm very cautious. We have investments in Open AI. I'm just not not in Open AI, but we have it in the Googles, the Microsofts and all this. but I would be cautious on the financing aspect of Open AI, the circular financing and given the concentration, you need to diversify the portfolio and you need to understand what you own and what happens if you're wrong. So if this trade goes south, it's going to take the indices with it. I don't think the general market again is as expensive as this concentrated part of the market. But yes, I think there's risk there and I don't think you're going to get these double triple digit returns like you have, and I think you have to go to other parts of the market. And going back to the Buffett indicator, keep in mind, that's just an indicator. He was still he's an investor in stocks, and he's telling you to really know what you're buying and don't overpay for it. That's really what he was saying by that indicator.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Google's AI Renaissance (Growth Story is Far from Over)\n\nAndrew Rocco\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGoogle Company Overview Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Alphabet ( GOOGL ) is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly accounting for roughly 90% of the online search volume and market share. Over the years, the company has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nAI Cannibalization Fears Overblown\nAlphabet’s dominant search market share and expanding cloud footprint are key growth drivers for the company. Initially, Google’s AI efforts got off to a shaky start. For instance, in Google’s first version AI model named “Bard,” searches often were completely inaccurate. Meanwhile, it appeared that ChatGPT and other models were running away with the AI race. However, several iterations later, and Google’s Gemini 2.5 AI delivers some of the most rapid responses in the industry and is viewed as an industry standard. Meanwhile, investor fears about cannibalization of the search business are unfounded. In fact, Google’s unique hybrid AI search model has driven popularity among younger users. Gemini models are being rapidly embedded across Search, YouTube, Android, and Workspace, enhancing user experience and driving internal productivity (e.g., coding, customer service).\n\nGoogle’s Groundbreaking TPU Google has constructed its own chips to power AI bots. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built to dramatically accelerate machine learning (ML) tasks, especially large-scale training and inference for models like Google's Gemini, powering Search, Photos, and more, available via Google Cloud and functioning as a core component of Google’s AI Hypercompute system. A TPU board fits into the same slot as a hard drive on the massive hardware racks inside the data centers that power Google's online services, the company says, adding that its own chips provide \"an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning\" than other hardware options. TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation.\"\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Gloud: A Consistent Growth Engine Alphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. In third-quarter 2025, Google Cloud revenues increased 33.5% year over year to $15.16 billion. Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics, and AI are positive. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, along with the growing number of data centers are helping Google expand its cloud footprint worldwide. Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA ( NVDA ) in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3, and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and the low-code Agent Designer tool.\n\nAd Business & YouTube Drive Top Line Growth AI is improving ad targeting and effectiveness, making the core business more resilient and profitable even with AI challengers. Meanwhile, YouTube continues to perform exceptionally well, acting as another strong pillar for revenue growth (especially the short-form video side). Zacks’ Consensus estimate sees double-digit top-line growth for the full year 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFuture Growth: Waymo Robotaxis Waymo is completing over 450,000 paid robotaxi rides per week across its operating areas, including Phoenix, LA, SF, and Austin. Reports from late 2025 indicate significant volume, a substantial increase from earlier in the year, with goals to reach 1 million weekly rides by late 2026. While I believe Tesla ( TSLA ) is poised to win the robotaxi race due to its scale and costs, there will likely not be one winner-takes-all and Waymo will have a significant chunk.\n\nImage Source: OurWorldinData\nBerkshire Hathaway Buys Alphabet Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently made a significant surprise investment, buying a $4.3 billion stake in Google's parent company, Alphabet, during the third quarter of 2025, marking a major tech bet for the value investor, likely driven by Alphabet's strong market dominance in search, its lucrative ad network, and potential in AI, despite Buffett's usual tech hesitation.\n\nGOOGL Has a Reasonable Valuation Google consistently has among the lowest P/Es among the Mag 7 stocks. With a P/E of 30x EPS, it’s reasonably priced and unsurprising that Buffett wants a piece. Additionally, the company has about $100 billion in cash and only $20 billion in debt. The strong cash balance provides the flexibility required to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStrong Trend & Technicals GOOGL shares have outperformed the general market indices and trended higher all year in a stair-stepping fashion. Investors can use the intermediate 10-week moving average as a trend guide.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nAlphabet remains one of the most strategically positioned companies in technology, combining dominant search economics, accelerating cloud momentum, and expanding AI-driven fundamentals.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

( BMNR ) has emerged as one of the most actively traded overseas stocks among South Korean investors this year, even as its share price has pulled back sharply from a July peak. The US-listed company, backed by billionaire Peter Thiel and led by Wall Street forecaster Tom Lee, ranks second only to Alphabet among foreign securities most favored by South Korean investors in 2025, according to data from the Korea Securities Depository. The strong interest reflects South Korea's retail investor base, often referred to as the ant army, which has shown a willingness to pursue higher-risk opportunities, particularly those tied to digital assets.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BMNR.\nIs BMNR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nInvestor attention intensified after BitMine announced a strategic pivot from Bitcoin mining to accumulating Ether, a move that pushed its shares up more than 3,000% to a peak on July 3. The stock had previously drawn limited attention but quickly became the most purchased overseas equity in South Korea during July following the shift. Since that peak, BitMine shares have declined by about 82%, yet retail demand has remained resilient. As of Dec. 29, South Korean investors had committed a net $1.4 billion into the company over the course of 2025, according to Korea Securities Depository figures, suggesting continued appetite despite elevated volatility.\n\nSome investors have sought amplified exposure through leveraged products, directing roughly $566 million into T-Rex's 2X Long BitMine Daily Target ETF, which launched after the company's summer surge and aims to deliver twice the stock's daily performance. That fund is down about 86% from its September peak. BitMine currently holds approximately $12 billion worth of Ether, making it the largest digital-asset treasury dedicated to the token, based on data from strategicethreserve.xyz. Ether itself is down about 11% in 2025 and was trading at around $2,945 on Tuesday morning in London, after momentum from listed Ether accumulators briefly pushed prices to a record near $5,000 in August before easing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Samsung’s First Trifold Phone Is Expensive and Half-Baked\n\nVlad Savov\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: SSNLF\n\nGOOG\n\nXIACF\n\nAAPL\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Nearly seven years in, the foldable smartphone era has been a letdown — but you can’t say that hardware makers haven’t tried.\nSamsung Electronics Co. became the first major player in 2019 to get in on the trend, and has kept at it since, releasing four new folding phones in 2025 alone, most recently the Galaxy Z TriFold. That device, which is available in South Korea to start and coming soon to the US, has two screens, two folds and a price of roughly $2,500 — about what it would cost to buy two high-end smartphones.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nTrifolds are an emerging subcategory of foldables, first attempted by Huawei Technologies Co. last year, that can take the form of both a smartphone and a widescreen tablet that’s well suited for watching videos. The convenience of having both in one gadget is supposed to overshadow the fact you could purchase both an iPhone Pro Max and iPad Pro for less.\nBut after a week of testing one of the first Galaxy Z TriFold units available in Seoul, it’s clear that this experimental phone is also held back by some unique design flaws that make it even less polished than regular — dare I say, normal — foldables. The price alone, and the engineering complexity that necessitates it, cements the device’s status as a niche item, all but ensuring it won’t resonate beyond early adopters and tech enthusiasts.\nSamsung’s latest launch is especially daring considering how little sales success it’s had in this segment. The category, which also includes models from heavyweights like Google and Huawei, still accounts for less than 2% of global phone sales, according to IDC data. Apple Inc. has so far sat out the fad, though it’s expected to release a folding iPhone in 2026. That makes the new year a pivotal time for the entire sector.\nTradeoffs Everywhere\nSamsung designed the TriFold to be folded up like a wallet, with creases splitting it into three sections when you’re holding the device in tablet mode. If the user begins to fold it incorrectly — by closing the right side before the left, for instance — the phone quickly warns them with on-screen notifications and physical vibrations. (Over a week of showing the handset to friends and colleagues, I found that most people do, in fact, initially get it wrong.)\n\nBut there’s no denying it’s sturdy. Samsung’s years of foldable engineering work show up in the TriFold’s construction. The device, which is the size of a 6.5-inch phone when shut, has zero gaps between its three sections and feels reassuringly dense and rigid in the hand. The hinges similarly exhibit the right amount of resistance and snap when opening and closing, and Samsung has slimmed every panel down to effectively the height of the necessary USB-C port.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile the phone is slimmer in most spots than the iPhone Air and many iPads, Samsung achieved that feat by pushing all the camera hardware into a large and heavy additional module. The TriFold’s back has both a camera bump and three lenses that protrude further out, undermining the broader emphasis on thinness.\nThe result is that the device feels lopsided both in the hand and when you place it on a flat surface. The fundamental premise of a foldable tablet like the TriFold is that the user gets the largest possible screen to use on the move in a pocketable form factor. But the experience is compromised when the weight is as imbalanced as it is here. The poor ergonomics made me not want to hold up the device to watch much video, even though the aspect ratio on the inner display is actually well suited for it. And it’s not as if there’s a built-in kickstand to give the user a break.\nThe 10-inch interior screen is also more prone to glare and reflections than other smartphone displays. Oppo's Find N5 foldable from earlier this year is vastly superior in this respect, proof that it’s possible to do better even with a flexible panel.\nMaking matters worse is some poor camera performance. Low-light photos appear grainy and dull, lacking the sharpness achieved by even midrange Android smartphones such as the $630 Xiaomi 17 or $799 Google Pixel 10. Samsung threw in additional selfie cameras on the big inner screen — which makes sense for video calls — as well as on the exterior. The latter is superfluous since the handset can already use the main camera in concert with the outside screen.\n\nAnother issue stems from the semi-circular bumps at the top and bottom of each hinge, which interfere with multitasking gestures when you’re using the screen in landscape mode. They also make swiping to the side in portrait mode awkward.\nSamsung also hasn’t solved a problem that’s endemic to foldables: the visible crease that occurs where the screen bends. Because the TriFold folds in two places, it has two such creases, and they remain apparent. While they’re more subtle from certain angles when the screen is on, you’ll always feel the creases as you’re swiping around. For all the improvements that Samsung and rivals like Huawei have made, this lingering design flaw presents a challenge to selling such devices at sky-high prices: That segment of the consumer market rarely accepts compromises.\n\nBut tradeoffs and imperfections define the experience of using the Galaxy Z TriFold. Samsung swaps the typical fingerprint sensor embedded in the display for one built into the power button on the side. It’s slower, less precise and less comfortable to use than what the vast majority of Android phones offer, including Samsung’s more conventional handsets. The folding design also precluded Samsung from putting the speakers on the sides, which means they offer less stereo separation than you’d get on a dedicated tablet.\n\nThe TriFold’s advantages over a regular handset — the large 10-inch display and good-for-a-smartphone audio quality — would be better served by an outsized battery to power them. Instead, the rather modest 5,600 milliampere-hour battery can trigger the smartphone equivalent of range anxiety, forcing users to choose between using the device as intended or conserving power. Gaming and video playback are particularly draining: Any extensive sessions are often cut short by battery depletion warnings that more conventional smartphones wouldn’t succumb to until hours later.\nIn comparison, recent Chinese flagships like Xiaomi Corp.’s 17 Pro Max and Oppo’s Find X9 Pro both offer bigger 7,500mAh batteries, offering consumers a reason to consider sticking with conventional non-folding phones.\nRecharging speeds are also slower compared with the Chinese competition. Samsung has equipped the TriFold with 45-watt wired and 15-watt wireless charging, while Vivo’s non-folding X300 Pro, for example, reaches 90 watts wired and 40 watts wirelessly, and has a larger battery to boot.\n\nWith this phone, Samsung made an attempt to optimize the software to take advantage of the larger screen. Using the company’s DeX software, which has been tweaked for this particular hardware type, you can also run a desktop-like experience directly on the large inner display. (Other Samsung phones must be plugged into an external monitor to activate DeX mode.) In DeX, the TriFold can operate as many as four distinct workspaces that can each run five apps simultaneously.\nBeyond that, the software experience feels half-baked, and not fully tailored for this new hardware type. Popular apps like Instagram are not all optimized, with Instagram Reels displaying in only one half of the screen when viewed in landscape. Meanwhile, the ability to run apps side by side has been standard on foldable devices for years, and is still of limited utility, so Samsung only deserves modest credit for implementing it here.\n\nSamsung has added the ability to start an activity on the exterior display and continue it on the inside by opening the TriFold to reveal the larger screen. However, that trick doesn’t work in reverse. For example, after picking a destination on Google Maps with the device open, the user can’t simply close the device and still see the route on the smaller screen.\nThe foldable proposition has always been reminiscent of the one that Apple offered with the original iPhone: pay an exceptionally high price and accept worse durability and battery life for the privilege of a futuristic design with a much larger screen. The problem for foldables is that standalone tablets already offer bigger displays at a much lower cost with very few design tradeoffs.\n\nSamsung’s pricey Galaxy Z TriFold doesn’t advance the foldable category in a meaningful way, serving mainly to underscore how great the engineering and design challenges are. Even more basic foldables, such as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, have only just begun to offer user experiences that come close to matching conventional smartphones.\nAdding an extra crease to a device for the sake of innovating and maximizing screen real estate means those devices will, for now, be more expensive and less refined. The adventurous shoppers keen to try out a first-generation foldable device will be better served waiting to see what Apple has to offer when it makes its long-awaited debut in this space.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Cipher Mining's AI/HPC Expansion Takes Shape: Is the Shift Paying Off?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:54 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CIFR\n\nWULF\n\nIREN\n\nGOOG\n\nCipher Mining ’s CIFR AI and high-performance computing (HPC) expansion is clearly taking shape, supported by long-term contracts, visible execution and a rapidly scaling pipeline that reshapes the company’s growth profile.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, Cipher Mining executed two landmark AI/HPC transactions that strengthened its revenue visibility. The company signed two landmark hosting agreements — a 10-year AI hosting deal with Fluidstack, backed by Google, and a 15-year direct hyperscaler lease with Amazon Web Services (AWS). These agreements collectively establish Cipher Mining as a credible HPC infrastructure developer and lock in roughly $8.5 billion of contracted AI/HPC lease payments, with revenues expected to commence in 2026.\n\nExecution risk has been a key concern in miner-to-HPC transitions, but Cipher Mining’s recent progress suggests the shift is advancing smoothly. In the reported quarter, the company highlights that construction at the Barber Lake site is already underway, with engineering, procurement and long-lead equipment secured and delivery of 168 MW of critical IT load targeted for late 2026. Importantly, Cipher Mining grew its contracted AI hosting capacity from zero to 544 MW in a single quarter, while maintaining a 3.2 GW development pipeline extending through 2029 and beyond.\n\nWhile AI revenues will ramp primarily from 2026 onward, Cipher Mining’s secured hyperscaler contracts, advancing buildouts and prudent capital structure suggest the change is moving beyond promise to reflection. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 15.69% revenue growth in 2026 underscores expectations for accelerating contribution from the company’s expanding AI/HPC platform.\n\nCIFR's Key Competitors in the AI/HPC Space IREN Limited IREN competes with CIFR through a more aggressive, GPU-centric strategy. IREN is building a large-scale GPU cloud platform, led by a $9.7 billion Microsoft contract and expanding relationships with Together AI, Fluidstack and Fireworks AI, announced during the first quarter of fiscal 2026. These deals support IREN’s expectations of over $500 million in AI Cloud ARR by early fiscal 2026 and a roadmap toward 140,000 GPUs powering multi-billion-dollar ARR potential.\n\nTeraWulf WULF is emerging as an AI/HPC competitor to CIFR through a long-term joint venture with Fluidstack, positioning TeraWulf as a power-first, infrastructure-centric provider for high-density compute. The joint venture targets long-duration contracts and is valued at $9.5 billion over 25 years. However, TeraWulf’s 250-500 MW annual expansion is largely back-end loaded, with most capacity unlikely to be online before 2026. This timeframe overlaps with CIFR's growth plans, intensifying competition as both target the same wave of hyperscaler and AI infrastructure demand.\n\nStory Continues\nCIFR’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimate Cipher Mining shares have risen steeply by 207.7% in the past six-month period, outperforming the Zacks Technology Services industry’s gain of 20.9%. However, the broader Zacks Business Services sector declined 7.8% in the same time frame.\nCIFR’s Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCIFR shares are overvalued, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 21.15X compared with the industry’s 2.73X. CIFR has a Value Score of F.\nCIFR’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor the full year 2026, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss is currently pegged at 88 cents per share, and remains unchanged over the past 30 days. CIFR reported a loss of 36 cents per share on a year-over-year basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCipher Mining currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Warren Buffett is retiring — here's what his favorite indicator reveals about the stock market\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nIt's time for one final check in with the investing GOAT's favorite stock market indicator before he rides off into the sunset.\nBerkshire Hathaway ( BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett , 95, will hand over the reins to his hand-picked successor Greg Abel on Wednesday.\nThe official passing of the torch caps a storied career for Buffett, which included buying a major US railroad (Burlington Northern), striking up a friendship with Microsoft ( MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates, and offering up scores of pithy comments in annual shareholder letters.\n\n“Berkshire’s culture is pretty simple,” Howard Buffett told me in a 2024 episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (listen below). “You do what you say you’re going to do, and you do it when you say you’re going to do it. You’re honest about it. You make mistakes and you accept responsibility for those mistakes.”\nHoward is in line to succeed his father as Berkshire chairman.\n\nThrough it all, Buffett championed the art of value investing, as taught to him by mentor Benjamin Graham. The philosophy is rooted in an unwillingness to overpay for investments.\nThe \"Buffett Indicator\" takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual US GDP. It rose to fame following a 2001 Fortune Magazine article written by Buffett and longtime Fortune writer and Buffett insider Carol Loomis.\n\n\"The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know,\" Buffett explained in the article. \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"\nThe indicator is at valuation levels never seen before, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. It suggests that stocks are long overdue for a healthy pullback in early 2026.\nPicking apart the numbers, the Buffett Indicator stands at about 221.4% — up a sharp 22% from April 30, per data from GuruFocus. The indicator has never been at a higher level dating back to the earliest data from GuruFocus in 1970.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) has shot up nearly 17% on the year amid major optimism surrounding the earnings potential of AI-related companies and the effect the technology will have on profits. Analysts in turn have scrambled to upwardly revise their profit forecasts on companies, supporting higher stock prices.\nFor his part, Buffett has bet on the AI future by maintaining stock investments in Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and more recently, Alphabet ( GOOGL ).\nWherever the stock market goes from here, one thing can't be questioned: Buffett's impact on investing.\n\nStory Continues\n\"I think Warren Buffett's the GOAT of capitalism,\" Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me on Opening Bid (video above) in October. \"There's so much guidance and wisdom that we've had from Warren over the years.\"\nBerkshire purchased Brooks in 2006. Each year at the storied Berkshire annual shareholder meeting, Brooks makes special edition sneakers with the face of Buffett as well as his longtime business partner Charlie Munger .\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.04 indicates a change of +4.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $94.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $340.26 billion and $390.18 billion estimates indicate +15.3% and +14.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Alphabet reported revenues of $87.47 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.3%. EPS of $2.87 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.95%. The EPS surprise was +26.99%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this company have returned -0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 points to a change of +31.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.04 indicates a change of +4.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

( NVDA , Financials ) investing $20 billion in AI inference business Groq shows its desire to dominate the AI ecosystem. Groq may continue operating independently while Nvidia uses its inference tools thanks to its founder Jonathan Ross and several engineers.Nvidia's planned diversification beyond AI training hardware is shown by the deal. Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPUs fuel most large-scale model training, but the company is now targeting inference, which has a far larger and recurring revenue potential.Over 90% of the AI GPU market is Nvidia. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq protects market dominance and adds software and service income streams while Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft construct their own inference processors to save costs.AI applications increase inference workloads considerably. AI token usage at major tech businesses increases every few months, fueling inference hardware and platform demand, say analysts. Beyond inference, Nvidia is entering networking, robotics, and government. Last quarter, networking sales surged 162% to $8.2 billion, while automotive and professional visualization grew double digits.Nvidia's Strong Buy consensus has 39 Buys and one Hold rating with an average price target of $263.58, implying 40% upside over a year.

      "Content": "AI Trade’s Next Leg Is All About Tech’s ‘Pick-and-Shovel’ Stocks\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBTC-USD\n\nVRT\n\nSNDK\n\nAPH\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The artificial intelligence trade is moving, and investors seeking cutting-edge ways to play it are snapping up technology “pick-and-shovel” stocks as massive cloud service providers pour billions into new data centers.\nData storage companies dominated the S&P 500 Index in 2025, with Sandisk Corp. shares soaring almost 580% to make them the benchmark’s best performer, with Western Digital Corp. in second and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc in fourth. Meanwhile, AI-linked power providers and cable and fiber producers such as Amphenol Corp., Corning Inc., NRG Energy Inc. and GE Vernova Inc. were among the Top 25.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nThat’s a shift from the last few years, when Nvidia Corp. — the original AI pick-and-shovel company — was entrenched among the top stocks in the S&P 500. The chip giant gained 40% in 2025, making it the 71st best performer in the index this year. While Nvidia and cloud hyperscalers Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are still powering the market due to their sheer size, their percentage gains have started to wane.\n“When the benchmarks are fairly concentrated, it’s important to look for themes that are gonna drive sales and earnings growth,” said Jake Seltz, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “AI is kind of one of those dominant themes right now, that’s nothing new. So we’re just looking, broadening our horizons beyond tech.”\n\nInvestors can find room to grow and better valuations by buying into the next wave of companies that are set to benefit from the billions of dollars hyperscalers are spending to build data centers.\n“What we are focused on are the picks and shovels of where that money is being spent,” said Matt Sallee, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which doesn’t own shares of any hyperscalers. “The chips to a degree, but more so some of the names that you haven’t really heard of.”\nOf course, there are some fears on Wall Street that the spending could slow, reversing gains in stocks tied to AI. It’s similar to what happened during the pandemic, when demand for basic home health products took off.\n“Covid hit and this world needed way more face masks, hand sanitizer, all those things,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management. But within six to 12 months there was a glut, and “those businesses that supplied those things went from the best times ever to the absolute worst times ever.”\nStill, investors remain bullish on the AI trade as the hyperscalers keep pledging to spend. Here’s what investors are buying now to play the tech infrastructure buildout.\n\nStory Continues\nData Storage\nWall Street expects data storage to remain hot in 2026 after Sandisk, Western Digital and Seagate surged in 2025. However, the boom times for this year’s winners may be coming to an end. For example, the average analyst price target for Sandisk in 2026 is $264, which would be a roughly 8% gain from where it currently sits at around $244.\n\nAnalysts see much bigger upside in a company like Pure Storage Inc., which is trading for $68 but is projected to reach $94 in 2026, a 38% leap. Other digital storage shares tied to AI include NetApp Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc.\nConstruction and Power\nA range of stocks associated with building and powering data centers are expected to keep running. Quanta Services Inc., which provides specialized contracting for utilities and telecommunications companies, is a top pick for Tortoise Capital’s Sallee. Other contractors include MYR Group Inc., Primoris Services Corp. and MasTec Inc.\nCompanies involved in wiring are also popular. They include Amphenol, which designs and manufactures high-speed fiber and copper interconnect solutions used in data centers, and Emcor Group Inc., which does mechanical and electrical construction. Other power infrastructure names include Vistra Corp., Constellation Energy Corp., GE Vernova and Generac Holdings Inc., which makes backup generators.\n\nBitcoin Miners\nBitcoin miners represent a potential “total revaluation story” as they pivot toward powering data centers and away from mining the cryptocurrency, according to Sallee.\n“They have the electricity already, they’ve had it for five-plus years to produce Bitcoin,” he said. “They’re going to redirect that electricity to higher-value, long-term contracts for high performance computing hosting.”\nNames in this area include Bitdeer Technologies Group, whose shares jumped in October after the company announced plans to move further into AI. Shares of IREN Ltd., Cipher Mining Inc., Riot Platforms Inc. and WhiteFiber Inc. have also received a boost from the companies’ intentions to convert to high-performance computing data centers.\nHeating and Cooling\n\nData centers require specialized precision controlled heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, creating demand for the companies that make them. Vertiv Holdings Co., which provides power systems and cooling solutions for data centers, is up 46% in 2025 and remains a stock to watch. Eaton Corp., another power management firm, overlaps with Vertiv but is less of a pure play, according to Seltz.\nOther names in the space include Comfort Systems USA Inc., which provides heating ventilation and air conditioning system installation and maintenance, as well as water providers Xylem Inc., Ecolab Inc. and American Water Works Co.\nSoftware\nSome investors with longer time horizons are looking to software as future beneficiaries of AI as large language models improve and more applications are built.\n\n“Investors are, I think, naturally inclined to look for companies that have cheaper valuations with terrific magnitude of growth that are potentially gonna really benefit from the application of AI,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha.\nSoftware stocks have generally underperformed this year, with the S&P 500 Software Industry Index rising 12% in 2025 compared with a 17% gain in the overall benchmark. But that has made the stocks’ valuations more appealing.\n“I don’t think those stories are dead,” said Allspring’s Seltz, who is watching names such as Snowflake Inc., Datadog Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. “It feels like it might be a little early, but the stocks do look attractive.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Could Be Among the First to Reach a $5 Trillion Valuation\n\nThomas Niel, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points In October, Nvidia's market cap briefly topped $5 trillion.\nWhile that particular \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has since pulled back, another member could join the $5 trillion club this year.\nGoogle parent Alphabet currently has a market capitalization of $3.8 trillion.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nBack in October, Nvidia became the first company with a market cap exceeding $5 trillion.\nNvidia's stock has since pulled back from that lofty level, but one big rally might be all it takes to lift the AI chip giant back above that value in 2026. Not only that, a few other companies could join that exclusive club, too.\nFor instance, as my fellow Motley Fool contributor Harsh Chauhan noted in an article on Dec. 20, Microsoft could conceivably hit that market cap milestone in the coming year .\nIn my view, another \" Magnificent Seven \" member also looks to be on the verge of joining the $5 trillion club: Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nWhy Alphabet is so close to hitting this milestone Alphabet shares have surged by 65% year to date. The primary reason for this has been the company's success in catching up to early adopters of generative artificial intelligence (AI) like Microsoft and OpenAI. Alphabet's Gemini 3 has given ChatGPT a run for its money.\nMore importantly, the AI Overviews and AI Mode features on the Google search engine have helped to increase user engagement with the platform. This has alleviated investors' initial concerns that the growing use of AI chatbots to answer people's questions would cut into Alphabet's primary profit center, search advertising.\n\nThanks to this year's significant share price run-up, Alphabet now has a market cap of $3.8 trillion. That means all it'll take for the company to reach a $5 trillion market cap is for it to appreciate in value by another 31.6%. Not only is that well within the realm of possibility in the next few years, there's a chance it could happen between now and next December. It all has to do with near-term earnings growth, coupled with the potential for the stock to experience further valuation expansion.\nCould it happen next year? According to sell-side analysts' estimates, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) could rise by over 41% between now and the end of 2028. This strongly suggests that it's a matter of when, not if, Alphabet will join the $5 trillion club.\nHowever, a move to that market cap could arrive as soon as 2026. Yes, the average sell-side analyst's earnings forecast may only call for 6% EPS growth next year, but those predictions may be too conservative. Even as Alphabet plans to ramp up spending on AI and cloud infrastructure, the payoff from these investments could take shape sooner than expected.\n\nStory Continues\nIn fact, we may already be witnessing this: Google's overall queries and revenue are growing by double-digit percentages thanks to AI integration. The sell-side forecasts at the high end of the range call for earnings growth of as much as 24% in 2026. Even if growth lands somewhere between the average and high end of the forecast range, that may lift the stock price by enough to get the company over the $5 trillion mark.\n\nShares currently trade for around 28 times expected forward earnings. If high growth persists into the coming year and bullishness about AI returns, names like Microsoft could again trade at forward P/Es in the mid-30s, and Alphabet could experience a similar rerating. Considering its plausible path to a $5 trillion market cap, Alphabet may be one of the first stocks investors should buy for the new year.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Ron DeSantis (R) said that Washington state’s fiscal outlook took a significant hit after Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) founder Jeff Bezos relocated from the state to Florida in late 2023.\n\nTaxpayers ‘Flee’ Due To Bad Policies On Sunday, in a post on X, DeSantis said that the state of Washington had “lost its biggest taxpayer,” referring to Bezos’ recent move to Florida.\nAccording to DeSantis, this single relocation of a billionaire entrepreneur has resulted in “a major impact” on Washington’s state budget.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\nFrom Moxy Hotels to $12B in Real Estate — The Firm Behind NYC's Trendiest Properties Is Letting Individual Investors In.\n\nWhile he didn’t mention any specific figures, Bezos’ move to his infamous “billionaire bunker” in the exclusive Indian Creek Village community outside of Miami in 2024 reportedly helped him save $1 billion in taxes . This is a considerable figure given Washington state’s annual revenue of $66.39 billion from 2023 through 2025.\nThis comes amid Washington’s plans for a new state income tax on its millionaire residents, which DeSantis said would be “counterproductive,” since it hands states that don’t have an income tax, such as Florida, “a major advantage over states that do.”\n“Washington has already driven taxpayers out due to bad policies,” he said, adding that the inevitable result of such bad policies is that “taxpayers will flee.”\n\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\nHe warned that states will continue spending, and eventually, what began as a tax on millionaires will expand to the rest of the tax base. “This will further erode the economic base — and the cycle will keep repeating,” he said in conclusion.\n\nStory Continues\nNeither Bezos nor the State of Washington immediately responded to Benzinga’s request for a comment on this matter. The story will be updated as soon as we receive a response.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nBillionaires Plan Exit From California Amid New Wealth Tax Other states, such as California, are headed in a similar direction, with a new proposal for a wealth tax on the state’s billionaires, called the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act.\nAccording to the proposal, a one-time levy of 5% would be imposed on all state residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion, with stiff penalties for understating wealth, and additional measures to prevent evasion among the state’s 200 billionaire residents.\n\nBillionaire investor Peter Thiel and Alphabet Inc.

      "Content": "Meta to Acquire Manus in $2 Billion Bet on AI Agents\n\nKurt Wagner, Luz Ding and Lulu Yilun Chen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:18 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTCEHY\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nCRM\n\nNOW\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to buy Manus, a popular Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, in its effort to build a business around its massive AI investment.\nThe deal values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a rare US acquisition of an Asian tech company and the latest multibillion-dollar AI bet from Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The agreement was struck in about 10 days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are not public.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nMeta intends to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating it into its products, it said in a statement. Backed by some of China’s biggest names like Tencent Holdings Ltd., ZhenFund and HSG, Manus shot to prominence early this year not long after DeepSeek’s debut. All of its existing investors have been bought out in Meta’s takeover, one of the people said.\n“There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson said. Manus' parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\n\nZuckerberg has made AI his company’s top priority, and is spending billions to hire researchers, build data centers and develop new models. Manus had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year from selling its AI agent to businesses via subscriptions, which could give Meta a more immediate return on some of its AI spending\nThe Manus AI agent can complete a handful of general tasks, such as screening resumes, creating trip itineraries and analyzing stocks in response to basic instructions. Butterfly Effect raised money earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in an investment round led by US venture capital firm Benchmark.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nMeta's purchase of Manus is likely aimed at expanding the former's AI agent task capabilities, as it currently lacks applications built on its own foundation model compared to a broader application ecosystem for ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. While the deal marks an early step for Meta to build a subscription and API business around its AI investment, it could draw regulatory scrutiny given that Singapore-based Manus was founded in China.\n\nStory Continues\n— Mandeep Singh and Robert Biggar, BI analysts\nAI agents are tools that don’t need human supervision to perform specific digital tasks. Enterprise software companies such as Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. have heavily promoted their versions of agents as the most effective way for businesses to use the emerging technology, rather than generative AI features such as chatbots, which require user prompts and interaction.\n\nMeta already has an AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available through the company’s social media and messaging platforms — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — in addition to its AI glasses. The US company is acquiring the technology and leadership group from Manus, though its statement didn’t detail where the new team will sit within the organization. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the deal’s value, said Manus co-founder and CEO Xiao Hong will report to Javier Olivan, chief operating officer of Meta, citing people familiar with the acquisition.\nAlexandr Wang, Meta’s Chief AI Officer who joined this summer as part of a high-profile investment into his startup, welcomed the Manus team of about 100 staff with a post on X. In his own message on the platform, Manus’ Xiao said that the deal would help his company expand the reach of its agents. “The era of AI that doesn’t just talk, but acts, creates, and delivers, is only beginning,” he wrote. “And now, we get to build it at a scale we never could have imagined.”\n\nMeta’s aggressive spending to compete in the AI race is matched by rivals like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. Zuckerberg has pledged to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure projects over the next three years, many of them expected to be AI-related. The company has hired an expensive team of researchers to develop a new state-of-the-art AI model it plans to debut next spring, and has faced some skepticism from investors who worry that the heavy spending won’t result in meaningful revenue anytime soon.\nVC firm Benchmark was criticized earlier this year by lawmakers and other venture investors for backing an AI company with ties to China. “Who thinks it is a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me,” US Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, wrote in a post on X in May. Benchmark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Meta deal Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the deal during a regular press briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday referred reporters to relevant regulatory agencies without elaborating.\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Philip Glamann.\n(Updates with Meta comment in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.\nBuy the \"Mag 7\" Hyperscalers Or Are They Spending Too Much?\nAlthough they are among the world&rsquo;s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\n\nThis includes Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\nThere is no doubt that &ldquo;hyperscaling&rdquo; is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns\nNotably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billio\nROIC Comparison\nWith Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market&rsquo;s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\n\nAmazon&rsquo;s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance\nMagnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon&rsquo;s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon&rsquo;s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts\nAmazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500&rsquo;s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Motley Fool Money starts now.\nFrom Fool Global headquarters, this is Motley Fool Money. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise another $100 billion. Give or take at a give or take valuation of about $800 billion. This comes after Greg Brockman, one of their co-founders, said that the company had to make trade-offs about whether it had enough compute to build the next model or whether it was going to serve ChatGPT. The question is, how long can they keep raising money without having a profitable business model, Lou? That seems like a fundamental tension, and these numbers are getting absolutely enormous.\n\nLou Whiteman: Yeah, no, you're asking the right question, and I don't know if any of us know the answer, and that's the scary thing. Just for fun, I asked AI, \"How much money is there in the world?\" It depends on what OpenAI needs, but it feels like AI is going to just swallow everything right now. Look, here's the problem. OpenAI doesn't have the cash-generating machine that Meta has, that Microsoft has, that Alphabet has. That is turning into a significant disadvantage here. All these companies are doing amazing thing. Remember, at the beginning of OpenAI, when we just marveled at this tool, and we're like, wow, this is magic. But now Gemini is giving me that magic. Everybody's giving me that magic.\n\nStory Continues\nTravis Hoium: People are baking is spending $20 a month to get magic in their pocket.\nLou Whiteman: Right. Frankly, I'm one of those people. I'm having fun with AI. I'm exploring AI, but I'm not going to buy seven different models for this. They needed the WOW factor before. If the WOW factor is rolling off and they still need all of this money, I don't know where they go from here. We're seeing pushbacks all over the place. This is a real question. At some point, they need to get their financial house in order and figure out, either as Greg said, how to do more with less or what compromises they have to make here.\n\nTravis Hoium: How do you think about this tension? We'll get to the stocks. I want to ask specifically about some of the companies that public market investors may or may not have some exposure to, but how do you think about this business that seems to be holding trillions of value in public markets up right now. Should we be worried about their business model, or should it just be about pushing the frontier forward with artificial intelligence as far and as fast as possible?\nAsit Sharma: I think we should keep an eye on the business model. OpenAI made some really consequential choices which serve them well in the last few years. As Lou mentioned, the explosion of interest we had in generative AI and how the world has changed. It's really due to OpenAI stepping up and pouring so much money into its frontier models. And at the beginning, those models were meant to be everything for everyone. But as time goes on, I think it's become more important that these big models can't be Swiss Army knives. They're simply not. You have to focus at some point on your markets and how you're going to monetize. Interestingly enough, competitor Anthropic has openly said, \"Look, we're focusing on the enterprise market. We're not out to get the most retail customers. We see some profit here with deep-pocketed enterprise businesses, so that's where we're focusing our model.\"\n\nTravis Hoium: That's specifically coding. That's where they have been ahead of the game. It was probably a month ago now when Gemini 3 came out, that beat all benchmarks. It did not beat Anthropics Claude on some of the coding benchmarks, which then they even took another step further beyond that. But that does seem like if a mode is building in this business from a model standpoint, Anthropic does have the focus to be able to do that.\nAsit Sharma: Yeah, in fact, I saw an interesting note on a Reddit thread, some developers the other day, which said, \"Okay, if you're prototyping something, maybe go to ChatGPT for the architecture conversation.\" Go to Gemini for the implementation of it, but go to Sonnet or Opus for the coding of it. You hit this on the head, Travis, that all of these models now are getting better in certain parts, but to be dominant in every category is not something the other businesses still want to chase. OpenAI almost seems like it has to, but of course, they're talking now about making the appropriate trade-offs. To me, that means they're going to have to focus on that big wide funnel of the hundreds of millions of users that are avidly going to ChatGPT and talking to it every day and figure out how to get conversational commerce going. Move in that direction, you have to understand over the long-term, the cost of your compute, and how you can reasonably sell it. It's a really simple equation eight now. They still haven't figured it out.\n\nTravis Hoium: They do seem to be leaning more toward that consumer side rather than the enterprise, they're not a hyperscaler themselves. Do they have to get into something like advertising or is a new business model, and we see this on the Internet? New business models come up when new technologies come around. Advertising does seem to be the thing that's a common thread here between all technologies. You can go back to television, radio. Now we're on the Internet, where it's all about advertising, and that's how you take away that pain point of somebody actually have to pay for something to watch a football game, for example. But that's fundamentally how they make the business work. Do they have to figure that out, or can they be a consumer company and do something else to make money?\n\nAsit Sharma: They can't be a consumer company and do something else to make money and expect the types of margins that investors want at these valuation rounds. At the end of the day, they'll have to get margin for somewhere to make the latest entrance, the people are coming in with the next tens of billions into the hundreds of billions of investment into OpenAI, to make that payout worth it for them to raise more capital. I think behind the scenes, sure, they're talking about how they pull advertising in. We can already see from the partnerships that company is making to bring brands into their funnel, Shopify is one that this is absolutely where they're headed. Now, the other stuff that they're exploring some of it even sketchy, a G-rated show, so I won't get into it. But some of that they'll be at the margins, other ways they can monetize the consumer.\n\nLou Whiteman: Every business that we discuss that has margin almost in this space when we think about Clouds, it comes down to that. Alphabet with YouTube, Meta with any number of its advertising properties, Netflix , so on.\nTravis Hoium: Lou, the impact on public markets, obviously, OpenAI isn't public. It's possible that they will IPO. You would think if you're raising money at $800 billion valuation, eventually those investors are going to want liquidity. That means going to the public markets. But the companies that are public, Oracle, CoreWeave, Nebius, these have been the hot names in AI. But they've all dropped precipitously, and they're the ones that are actually funding the acquisition of Nvidia chips. We talked about circular financing, but there is a circular almost business model here and financing model here that is starting to impact these public companies negatively. Is that something that we should be concerned about with OpenAI at the core?\n\nLou Whiteman: We should be watching it. I think it's the same question, though. All of this makes sense if it ends up making sense.\nTravis Hoium: It works until it doesn't.\nLou Whiteman: If there is a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, none of this is a problem. I think the question is, and what you guys are getting at is that, is there a pot of gold at the end of OpenAI's rainbow, and how do they get there? I think if nothing else, it's time to differentiate. It's time to not paint the entire sector with one brush and say, \"AI, good, which every trend, every innovation we've had has had winners and losers.\" The question for OpenAI is back to what you're saying, consumer, business, whatever. Right now, they're in a position where they need to look for revenue. Wherever they can find it, and they need to look for investment wherever they can find it because they need a lot of money. They need more money than any one single source can do it. I respect that everything is on the table. However, just because they might be doing what they should, I don't know if that guarantees success.\n\nTravis Hoium: Yeah, do you have thoughts on whether these companies? Are they building a house of cards? Is this a new phenomenal business model building data centers that we just haven't seen before? Where's its head at?\nAsit Sharma: I think long-term, the investment in data centers is needed, and some companies are going to have some rough times in the future as demand and supply normalize. Whether that's three years from today or five years from today, or we read the tea leaves much sooner, and those companies get punished. I don't know about those time frames, but everything that we're seeing today is predicated a lot of it. Let's not say everything. A lot of it is predicated on what Sam Altman thought a few years ago, that the more of compute that we throw with these models, the better they'll get at different tasks and so we need to invest lots and lots of money to make way for that compute. Nvidia played into that. Jensen Huang is a firm believer in that. There's some proof in the pudding in that as we use these models and ask them to reason more, that entails more compute. But we've totally avoided the other side of the conversation, which is, how do we make this stuff more energy efficient? How do we make on the algorithmic side, this stuff more efficient? How do we make on the development of the models, this side, all of this more efficient? By avoiding those conversations, we're setting up a future in which it has to be like boom or bust for some companies. They're going to win on that big scaling model. That's where OpenAI has thrown its chips. There'll be lots of little players, too, smaller players who don't need all of that power, and I think something you want to talk about, Travis, is maybe Gemini's smaller models. Those are interesting and we can go there if there's time.\n\nTravis Hoium: Yeah, I want to get to that next. We need to take a quick break. We will get to the recovery of Alphabet in 2025. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nLou Whiteman: Yeah, what a year it's been for Alphabet. The thing that they're reaping benefit from today is a lot of work that they did years ago.\nAsit Sharma: There were some discussions, I think the Investment Community, maybe last year, the year before that, look, Alphabet ought to be able to catch up because it has deep expertise. In fact, Google scholars were the ones who came up with transformer technology that we're all riding off of today. But I would have been surprised if you told me that at the beginning of the year. How is it doing it? It's not having to focus again with these huge scaling laws as OpenAI has done, and they've made those choices. Alphabet has really deep expertise in smaller models, and they have the very deep pockets to go ahead and experiment and play around. You sent out a tweet and an image to me and Lou this week, which was basically discussing how good Gemini Flash 3 is. This is a smaller model from Gemini in terms of cost and compute efficiency. I'm not going to get into all the details here, except to say that and the 2.5 model from Gemini are really efficient. You point out one 10th the cost. Now, you have to keep in mind, you're probably referring to developers who are using the API, but still let's go there. Maybe a 10th the cost of, say, OpenAI and some of its competitors. What it does, it gives you a lot more intelligence for less money. If I could boil it all down. You may not want a genius level intelligence, but what if you want reasonably good intelligence for something that's sufficient, they've provided that.\n\nTravis Hoium: Let's give an example there. Duolingo was one of OpenAI's biggest users, maybe even their biggest user of their API. The example there would be if you have a conversation with their advanced plan, you can have a conversation in a different language, and the AI we'll talk back to you. We'll have a conversation as you learn a language. That conversation maybe a tenth of the cost coming out out of this Gemini model versus a comparable OpenAI model. Is that the way to think about it? Now as the companies are going, how do we make money on this? That becomes a big piece of the equation?\nAsit Sharma: I think so. It's slightly beyond my pay grade. I will say this the way I think of it myself is if you're a smaller developer and you've got a database, and you need to use the AI to develop a conversational bot, it is a lot cheaper for you to run that through Geminis model. What it costs you per token, you get so much more out of these models, so I think we can extrapolate safely. If you're an expert in AI, write back to us if we're wrong, but I think you can extrapolate and say, sure, they could potentially use that model. They are going to get everything that is Duolingo get everything it needs in terms of reasoning and also real time compute to provide you an excellent tutor, probably using that model, I would guess. For all intents and purposes, that's a good example.\n\nTravis Hoium: Lou, when you look at the comeback of Google and Alphabet, is this just where we were headed from the start, and they are just using their power to bludgeon the competition or starve the competition, however you want to look at it, it's gonna be tough. I saw something today they have five of the ten most downloaded apps, free apps in the Apple App store. It just seems like there is so much power coming out of mountain view and OpenAI is going up against that.\nLou Whiteman: We love to talk about this as competitions, Sharks versus jets, whatever. But I think this is just businesses being rational businesses, and I don't think it is like they're going after OpenAI. I think Alphabet is just doing what it should be doing. The fear for a while now is that these models would be commodities. That basically, if all these models can essentially do the same thing, you're not going to pay for seven of them, and price is inevitably what you're going to look at. Alphabet has it, and I don't think this is a loan to Alphabet. I think it's bad news for OpenAI, but I think you're going to see this in a lot of the winners is that they have the ability to price competitively, and they're doing so. It is really lousy for OpenAI because they don't have the existing revenue streams. They don't have the ready access to especially corporate customers. But look, everything we're talking about, this is ASA was talking about efficiency. ASA was talking about energy use. This is everything we want to happen for humanity, for investors, for everything. I think it could be both bad news for OpenAI, but if we are getting to a point where these things are more cost competitive and they can actually be put to use by more companies, this is a good thing, and I don't think it's a surprise that Big Tech, the ones with all of the resources in the existing business, that they're the ones that can capitalize it over a start-up.\n\nTravis Hoium: Lou, I want to ask you quickly about the market. We've been basically flat over the past month or so, but we're having a pretty good year up 16%, I think it is for the S&P 500 . The interesting thing is the Fed started cutting rates, and yet the 10 year is up. How do you think about going into the end of the year at the start of 2026? Is the market starting to run out of gas, or is there something else going on?\nLou Whiteman: Look, we are always just a measure of conventional wisdom. It's always just like how many bulls and how many bears at a given moment. I hate when we try and read into things are going up, so they will continue or things are tough now, so it's a new paradigm or something like that. I think what we've seen that some of the benefit of the doubt, especially among the big AI companies, is fading, that there is just a hint of skepticism. All these things that people have been talking about for a year now, Travis, the buildout crypto all of the expenses, all of these just worrying signs that didn't really resonate in the market now are just inching in. Again, I don't want to predict the sky is falling. I don't want to predict that it goes down from here, just like I don't think six months ago, we should have said, it has to go up from here since it's not bothering. But again, back to what I said before, in every wave we've ever had, there have been winners and losers. I think there's just more of scrutiny and less benefit of doubt being given to everyone, and I think that's what's playing out in the.\n\nTravis Hoium: I agree, Lou. I think the support that AI companies bring to the market means that capital is staying put. It's rotating around, and we're seeing different themes get money and then being sold. But overall, perhaps this keeps the markets at least level next year. I'm terrible at predicting these things, but we'll see 2026 is almost here. We'll be back in a moment.

Today, I want to have Lou and Asit hand out candy or coal for some of the most important executives or people in finance throughout the year. Lou, I want to start with you. Brian Nichol has been one of the most important people in food, retail, now running Starbucks . Does he get candy or coal in his stocking this year?\nLou Whiteman: The key here is this year because Nicholas had a heck of a career, and I'm taking that away from him, but this has not been the year that he is going to want at the top of his Wikipedia page. I don't think he's getting coal from me. I worry about these yesterday's brands becoming growth stocks again in general I struggle with that. But look, the China joint venture, I think there's at least questions there. There's operational issues with what he's trying to do back to Starbucks. There's been employee action and Starbucks is a really tough company to get its Mojo back. The jury's still out. It's early, etc. I'm not going to declare it a failure, but there has been more questions than answers this year, and so I am not praising the Brian Nichol 2025. I'm sorry, I can't.\n\nTravis Hoium: Asit?\nAsit Sharma: I'll give him spot him another year. I think this is a really difficult business to try to turn around.\nTravis Hoium: He did go from the King of the world to massive project moving from Chipotle to Starbucks.\nAsit Sharma: Yes, it's easier to stay King of the world. I'm not sure I agree with all of the capital decisions that Starbucks has made, but I love at least the push to reinvigorate the brand, to bring it back to what it used to be. I'm not sure that's still possible, but I'll spot him a little bit of candy, like one peppermint candy cane. Ask me next year, and we'll see whether that turns a little more Cole or I'll give some more candy.\nTravis Hoium: Lou, do you think that a brand like Starbucks can get back that magic? Can I just think about my I don't go Starbucks, particularly often, but when I do, you walk in there and there's a counter with 50 cups of coffee and people randomly grabbing them. It's just very different from 10, 20 years ago when it was a place that I would go do homework in college and people would just go hang out at Starbucks. That doesn't even seem to be possible in a lot of Starbucks today.\n\nLou Whiteman: This is a theme that I'm thinking a lot about. Maybe it's just old age, but companies that I think will do fine, but the stock, it's separating out the company and the stock. I think there's a place for Starbucks. I think you can get the magic back, and I still don't know if that pays off for investors as a real wow growth investment. I think it's possible, but I'm getting more and more skeptical about what worked before and inherits the Earth up ahead, and I think about that with Starbucks, Nike , so many of the brands that I'm so in love with over the years.\nTravis Hoium: It'll be interesting to see what we look back on those brands being starting at the pandemic. That was a real turning point for a lot of the ways that we live. You can have a lot of opinions about that's Jerome Powell. Is he getting candy or coal in his stocking from you?\n\nAsit Sharma: He's getting candy. Whatever you think of Jerome Powell, he and I both know what it's like to do your job well when your boss is constantly telling you, I just want you the heck out of here. I'll walk that back. I think our managers and leaders at the Motley Fool Love, all three of us. That was a little bit of a joke, but look, tremendous pressure went from a tightening cycle to an easing cycle this year ended the year with one more bit of quantitative easing. I think doing this against the backdrop of the enormous pressure of the interest rate environment we've been in, the inflation environment, also the supply.\nTravis Hoium: Didn't have a lot of data the last couple of months.\nAsit Sharma: Didn't have data to work off of. The supply imbalances in trade due to tariffs. There's a lot going on there, and I wonder if he didn't adopt some of the methods of one of his earlier predecessors, Alan Greenspan, who famously used to lie in the bath tub to relax and read economic figures. I would guess Jerome did a little bit of that this year, but he held his term, I believe, is up in May of next year. I'm going to give him some high marks. The man deserves a little bit of candy in his stocking.\n\nLou Whiteman: I'll give him a lot of candy, because everything was had said more, not just that his boss or the person who would like to be his boss giving him flack, but look, the markets got used to money being free. The markets became convinced that the only way we can benefit is if money was free. He was not only putting up with or trying to navigate pressure from above, but also, I think pressure from retail and pressure from New York and Wall Street. I think I'm showing my bias here, but I think his take on it that, no, we want to preserve our firepower and not run too fast, I agree with him on that. I think it took a ton of courage to not give in and to take all that. Nothing but candy for me and bathtub or wherever, enjoy your retirement room because you've earned it.\n\nTravis Hoium: Let's move back to tech, and the company that's AI adjacent, we've been waiting for them to get into the AI game. Apple's Tim Cook. Seems like he's missed a lot in 2025. The VR headset was not a hit. Their AI strategy. I don't know what's going on. Yet, they're selling a ton of phones, and at the end of the day, that's what drives the business. Lou, where is your head at with Tim Cook, candy or coal?\nLou Whiteman: He's getting candy. Now, he might not get as much candy as Jerome. I might take some of Jerome Powell's candy and give it to Cook. But look, multiple things can be true. I don't buy the idea that Apple didn't fail at AI because Apple always comes in and innovates. Apple spent a lot of money trying to get AI right, and they didn't, it didn't go to script, so I don't think we can give them a pass on that. That said, everything we talked about, commoditized models, the importance of having revenue, of having a customer base. I think Apple ends up a winner in AI, just working with Tim and or working with. It turns out they didn't have to come up with their own model. I think they're fine. The next big thing is still a real question. You're right they haven't solved it. I'm not Tim Cook, but I don't know the answer there so that is lingering over them. But if nothing else, one of the best run companies in the world gets a solid B this year, even if not an A plus, and that's got to be worth some candy.\n\nAsit Sharma: I'll agree with that. For me, Tim Cook gets two really small peppermint candy canes so there's 24 packs that come, let's give him 1/12th of those. Tim Cook did Tim Cook this year.\nTravis Hoium: That's like a night for the kids at my house.\nAsit Sharma: Yeah. But he did what we expected of him he is this operational genius. It doesn't matter what the environment is. I mentioned tariffs just a moment ago. He navigated all of that pretty flawlessly even look at the latest Apple models. They're starting to get traction in China again, which was a market. I thought they were going to have to at some point, just not write off, but.\nTravis Hoium: It wouldn't have the dominant position they had for a long time.\n\nAsit Sharma: Get used to being maybe a number two so they're still competitive there, and people still want their phones. The key question for Apple is who succeeds, Tim? Can we get someone who executes the level he does? Or do we need a visionary? Because the IP at Apple all the billions that have been poured into their IP is sitting there but has not been successfully monetized outside of its phones and its content. They've tried so many things over the years, like the Apple car. They made a stab at AI, but I agree with Lou. Maybe just partnering up is the way for them to go. There's so much that Apple could do as a company beyond their phone near monopoly for high end phones. I think that, look, this is the question, could you get someone who has a little bit of the Steve Jobs visionary capability in him or her with a lot of Tim Cook's operational excellence? It's a really tough question.\n\nTravis Hoium: Have we ever seen a company do that? Go from visionary to operating person back to someone who is visionary, but at this scale that's the other thing is you're talking about one of the biggest companies in the world, somebody young, vibrant coming in and going, Hey, Tim, get out of the way. I'm coming in I got ideas.\nAsit Sharma: With all this AI, you could construct an avatar that blends the two together. I have no idea how they're going to make this work.\nTravis Hoium: It will be very interesting to see what happens with Apple over the next couple of years, especially with that succession planning. That seems like it's going to be a huge topic. Asit, I'm going to start with you with the next one. Sam Altman, candy or coal in his stocking.\n\nAsit Sharma: I've been talking this around the margins, my opinion of Sam Altman this year. It's slightly some coal, a lump of coal. But for a more surprising reason, after everything we've discussed before, I think Sam really whiffed this year with ChatGPT 5.2. He talked that up in a way that we were ready to be blown away as we were in earlier years whenever they released a great new model, and it was really disappointing. In fact, I still go back sometimes to my 4.0 setting because that model of GPT just understands me so well. I love it so much. Are you listening, Sam? Sam, what did you do? Why did you do this? Why did you not understand that talking up a product that was not going to change the world is not a great strategy when you're going out competing in this battlefield, sir? Anyway, so there's a little bit of coal that I have for him and his stock.\n\nTravis Hoium: Lou.\nLou Whiteman: I think I have the answer to that or a potential answer to that and that's because that's what he needs to do.\nTravis Hoium: He's got to raise that next $100 million.\nLou Whiteman: Again he had the most success raising funds when Open AI was magic. He needs Open AI to be magic, whether it is or not. Look, I give him credit for doing what I think he has to do. Now, I don't know if that will end up working out for him, and I don't know. It's a tough thing. At the end of the day, I went to ChatGPT, and I found out that a pound of candy canes is worth 7-15 bucks. A pound of coal is worth about $0.15. Given the way Open AI needs money, I'm going to give him candy canes and not coal just so he can sell the things, need a little less money to raise. How about that?\n\nTravis Hoium: Fair enough. Alright, let's go to someone who was in his final days officially as the CEO. Warren Buffett. Lou, you got to give him candy, right? This has been quite a run.\nLou Whiteman: But are we doing it for this year?\nTravis Hoium: Well, let's do this year.\nLou Whiteman: Brian Nichol has had a great run, Travis. Here's the thing, who am I to question Warren Buffett and that sincerely, and I'm a shareholder. But if you look at this year and you look at the last few years, I do ask myself the question. If it was anyone other than Warren Buffett, what would we be thinking?\nTravis Hoium: Outside of that Apple investment that they made about a decade ago, not a lot of great wins over the past decade.\nLou Whiteman: You can walk and chew gum at the same time. I get saving your investment capital for better markets I get that I agree with Warren. A lot of the markets, to me, have looked overvalued. I've still found ways to place stock. But they have, what, a third of $1 trillion in cash. I feel like you can deploy some of that and still have an ample reserve. I don't think they're going to deploy $350 billion into a Dow turn. I'm going to give him candy it's going to be See's candy, of course, it has to be. But I do think, and we can talk about Greg Abel, too, but I do think that man, the pressure is on because at some point, the benefit of the doubt of Oh, it's just I think if we took the label off this company and looked at their actions over this year and the last few years, I don't think there'd be a lot of people rushing to buy in.\n\nTravis Hoium: Asit.\nAsit Sharma: I'm going with 24 of those small candy canes. I want to give Warren the whole box. I think he deserves it. I think his message implicitly is, Hey, shareholders I gave you about a third of 1 trillion bucks on the balance sheet, cash. I gave you this amazing assemblage of operating companies. I present to you Greg Abel, who I have trained. I have built the culture that we needed. I've done many of these deals on handshakes, and I hope my successors can do the same when they acquire companies. We've been one of the most successful investment vehicles on Earth. I'm going out on top with no regrets. I still have my health. I'm still drinking one can of Coke or more every day. What more do you want? Give me the candy. [OVERLAPPING] I don't know how he has any insides left.\n\nTravis Hoium: Alright. Quickly, Lou. Larry Ellison, candy or coal.\nLou Whiteman: I guess he needs to get candy because every son should have a father so supportive, if nothing else for that.\nTravis Hoium: Hey, dad, I want to take over media.\nLou Whiteman: Larry has always been someone who knows the way the wind is blowing and who can position himself and I don't mean that as a backhanded compliment. It has worked out for him well. I think he has done that well this year. I know there's questions about Blue Owl. I know there's questions about everything right now. I'm not going to bet against Oracle coming out, if nothing worse than fine from this, too, just because Larry knows how to work the room.\nTravis Hoium: Asit, quickly, what do you think about Larry Ellison in 2025?\n\nAsit Sharma: I think Lou did such a great job of hitting his highlights. I want to give him a little bit of coal, an admirer of Larry Ellison, own some Oracle , have recommended it in a service. I just didn't like at the end of the year with all that debt, and I understand the argument that it's staggered out there. That they are just pitching more into a leveraged position and placing such a concentrated bet on their role in AI, which could be a great role their technology is amazing. It colored my view of Larry, but he's a wild guy he's an adventurous guy. We know that. He's always been this way, and so we see it manifest in his business dealings and the risks he takes.\nTravis Hoium: When we come back, we going to get to Stock Center Radar, you're listening to Motley Fool Money.

We like to end the show by asking each channelist for a stock on their radar and get some questions from Dan Boyd behind the glass. Lou, you're up first. What's on your radar this week?\n\nLou Whiteman: Consulting giant Accenture , they released earnings this week. Numbers look pretty good to me. Revenue up 6% year over year, earnings per share up 10%, both top the Wall Street estimates. Look, investors have been down on consultants this year, worried that a tough economy would limit new business. Talk of AI replacing consultants in the future. But Accenture booked $21 billion in new business in the quarter a lot of that AI related, and 33 new clients. There are 33 clients with bookings greater than $100 million. Stock is down 23% for the year, Dan, I think that's a market overreaction. Accenture looks really interesting.\nTravis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about Accenture?\nDan Boyd: Is there anything going for Accenture other than AI right now, Lou?\n\nLou Whiteman: Yeah. Oh, they do a lot of work that isn't AI. It's just AI is all anyone wants to talk about. Look, Dan, at the end of the day, if you're a CEO and you want to do a project, you hire Accenture just so you can blame them if it goes wrong. That's the bull case.\nTravis Hoium: Asit, what's on your radar this week?\nAsit Sharma: I'll make this short and sweet. I'm looking at Embraer . This is the Brazilian jet Maker symbol EMBJ. This is a business I wrote about 13 years ago, and the stock did nothing, but here we are. The aerospace industry has changed. Now the company has a tremendous backlog. It has a number one position in 76 Cedar plane the type of plane that I take when I have to fly from Raleigh to Washington. It also is a leader in the small and midsize business jet category. It's a business that's operating at pretty good margins for an aerospace manufacturer about 9%. Also, Embraer is really great for its maintenance services. It's getting a lot of incremental revenue from maintenance and repair.\n\nTravis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about small jets?\nDan Boyd: I don't know anything about small jets, Travis. I am worried about investing in a small jet company. It seems like I don't need a small jet. I can't afford a small jet. Are people buying small jets?\nAsit Sharma: Well, Dan, the bulk of their business, actually, you probably flown on an Embraer and didn't know it in a small market, but we understand from before the show, you don't fly to small cities you only fly to big cities.\nDan Boyd: No, Asit, I'm big time, Dan Boyd.\nTravis Hoium: Alright, big time Dan Boyd, which stock is going on your watch list?\nDan Boyd: I don't know. Again, I'm getting big time Asit here, and I'm going to go with Accenture so sorry, jets.\n\nTravis Hoium: Or Lou Whiteman, Asit Sharma, Dan Boyd behind the class and the entire Motley Fool team. I'm Travis Hoium. Thanks listening to Motley Fool Money. We'll see you here tomorrow.\nAsit Sharma, CPA has positions in Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, and Oracle.

      "Content": "Alphabet vs. Microsoft: Better AI Stock to Own in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Microsoft's Azure has been the fastest grower of the big three cloud computing companies.\nAlphabet has a cost advantage with its custom AI chips that should become more evident starting next year.\nBoth stocks should perform well in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two of the largest cloud computing companies in the world, and both have been seeing strong growth as a result of artificial intelligence (AI) . However, in 2025, Alphabet's stock clearly shone; it's up around 65% as of this writing, compared to about a 16% gain for Microsoft.\n\nLet's see which stock is best positioned to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Microsoft Microsoft was hitting on all cylinders in 2025, although its stock still slightly trailed the performance of the S&P 500 heading into the final week of trading. Last quarter, the company grew its total revenue by 18% year over year and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 23%, as it saw strength across segments.\n\nThe growth is being led by its cloud computing unit, Azure, which has been the fastest growing of the big three cloud providers. Last quarter, Azure revenue surged 40%, driven by demand for AI services. It was the ninth consecutive quarter of 30% or more growth for Azure. Growth could have been even more robust if Azure were not capacity-constrained, and Microsoft said, given accelerated demand, that its capital expenditures (capex) will now grow at a quicker pace in fiscal 2026 versus last year.\nMicrosoft continues to have strong ties to OpenAI, with whom it owns a 27% stake. It also has exclusive intellectual property rights and privileged application programming interface access to its large language models (LLMs) through 2032. This, combined with OpenAI making an additional $250 billion in computing commitments, should help continue to drive strong growth in the coming years. The company has also struck a deal with Anthropic.\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology throughout its products -- such as its AI assistant copilots -- which is also helping to drive growth. An expected July price hike for Microsoft 365 enterprise users should boost revenue next year.\nThe case for Alphabet Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet's growth is being led by its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud. Last quarter, Google Cloud revenue soared 34%, while its segment operating income surged 84%. Although its revenue growth is a bit slower, the company has some strong advantages that should start to become more pronounced in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIts biggest edge is its custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). While Microsoft has developed its own custom AI chips, they are far behind Alphabet's TPUs, which were created more than a decade ago and have been tightly woven into its system. This gives it a large structural cost advantage over Microsoft, which is still reliant on Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs). Alphabet's TPUs are so good that Anthropic has placed a big order for them to run some of its AI workloads.\n\nAlphabet has also developed Gemini, one of the top LLMs in the world and another long-term advantage over Microsoft, which largely depends on OpenAI. This gives it not only more flexibility as it incorporates Gemini throughout its products but also more revenue streams. Meanwhile, by having both top-tier chips and AI models, Alphabet has created a flywheel effect that Microsoft just does not have.\nThe verdict Alphabet and Microsoft trade at similar valuations. Alphabet trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times 2026 analyst estimates, while Microsoft trades at 30 times fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) estimates and 26 times fiscal 2027 estimates. Given their valuation and growth outlooks, I think both stocks can perform well next year.\n\nHowever, I think that, ultimately, Alphabet's stock will once again outperform. The company has a long-term advantage in having the most complete AI tech stack, and that should become more noticeable next year, especially if it starts renting out its TPUs to more customers. Meanwhile, if Google search revenue continues to accelerate, driven by its AI initiatives, investors will likely start to bid up the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Could This Underrated AI Stock Be the Best Growth Story of 2026 and the Next Decade?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:06 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points The mainstream introduction of AI and increased competition was one of the best things to happen to Alphabet.\nThe company has a big structural cost advantage with its custom AI chips.\nAlphabet has the most complete tech stack of any AI company, setting it up to outperform over the next decade.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWhile Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has been the best performer among the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks this year, it still may be one of the most underrated artificial intelligence (AI) stocks around and has one of the best growth stories both next year and over the long term.\nLet's look at why Alphabet is a stock you'll want to invest in .\nControlling the entire tech stack When OpenAI introduced AI chatbots to the masses, Alphabet's Google search engine faced its first real competition in decades. However, it likely is one of the best things that could have happened to the company. First, the competition from AI was one of the biggest reasons the company was allowed to keep its Chrome browser and Android smartphone operating system, each of which holds an over-70% market share, despite losing a government antitrust case.\n\nNot only that, but the judge also let it keep its exclusive search revenue-sharing deal with Apple . If not for the looming threat of AI, this may not have played out this way.\nHowever, the ruling ultimately kept intact Alphabet's huge distribution advantage. Through Chrome, Android, and its revenue-sharing deal with Apple, Google Search is the default gateway to the internet for people around the world. It also gives the company multiple surfaces to incorporate its own Gemini AI model into. This is a big edge over chatbot apps, as it's meeting people where they already are and is creating a frictionless AI experience. That's easier than having people download and use a stand-alone app.\nAt the same time, competition from OpenAI and others also brought the best out of the company and shone a light on some of its behind-the-scenes innovations. Alphabet has long been working on AI, but there was no real need to push it forward given its dominant search position. However, the introduction of ChatGPT helped supercharge its efforts and led it to create one of the best large language models (LLMs) available: Gemini. As it incorporates Gemini throughout its products, this is now helping drive query and revenue growth.\n\nThe emergence of AI also threw a spotlight on Alphabet's decades-long development of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Alphabet has long been using these custom chips to run its internal workloads, but as the need for computing power exploded to run AI workloads, Alphabet suddenly found itself in an enviable position.\n\nStory Continues\nIts chips could train LLMs and run AI inference at a much cheaper cost than Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs), giving it a big structural cost advantage. This has created a huge flywheel for the company, where it can more cheaply train its model, giving it the resources to make both Gemini and its chips better, leading to more success and the cash to put back into its LLM and chip efforts.\n\nAlphabet's TPUs have become so good that they are now a competitive alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. For example, Anthropic has placed orders to use TPUs to begin to power some of its AI workloads. Morgan Stanley projects that Alphabet will get roughly $13 billion in annual revenue for every 500,000 TPUs that customers deploy. Its analysts estimate that Alphabet will rent out 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028.\nBeyond TPUs and Gemini Alphabet's chip advantage isn't just in hardware. The TPUs are specifically designed to handle tasks optimized for its TensorFlow framework and, more recently, other frameworks, such as JAX and PyTorch, used to train neural networks. It's also integrated with Alphabet's software, such as its XLA compilers, which fuse multiple small tasks into a single optimized operation. This allows AI workloads to run more quickly while using significantly less power and memory. Meanwhile, its Vertex AI platform allows customers to easily use its TPUs and XLA compilers.\n\nThe company is also looking to extend its vertical integration advantage. It is set to acquire cloud computing cybersecurity company Wiz to add another level to its tech stack. It also just announced that it is purchasing energy infrastructure company Intersect to help it secure access to necessary power for its data center buildout.\nAlphabet is the most complete end-to-end AI company on the planet, and the advantages of its vertical integration and its controlling the complete tech stack should just grow over time. That's what makes it the best growth story in AI both for 2026 and over the next decade.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Top Stock Picks for Week of December 29, 2025\n\nPanel Of Zacks Experts\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:17 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nCIEN\n\nAlphabet ( GOOGL ) is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others. Alphabet shares have outperformed the industry in a year. GOOGL is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, Google Cloud, and Search. Google Cloud ended the third quarter of 2025 with $155 billion in backlog, up 46% sequentially. The number of new Google Cloud Platform customers increased by roughly 34% year over year, and 70% of Google Cloud customers now use Alphabet’s AI products. In third-quarter 2025, revenues from products built on Alphabet’s generative AI models (Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria) grew more than 200% year-over-year, reflecting accelerating adoption. Search is benefiting from AI Overviews and AI Mode that has driven growth in overall queries. YouTube is benefiting from the growing demand for shorts. Management execution has been good in recent times, which has helped Alphabet to build solid cash and short-term investment balance.\n\nCiena Corporation ( CIEN ) is a leading provider of optical networking equipment, software and services.Ciena’s fiscal fourth-quarter reflected year-over-year 20% top-line gains, 69.5% EPS growth and a record $5 million order backlog, driven by accelerating AI-led demand from cloud and service provider customers. Driven by strong cloud and service provider momentum, Ciena gained 2 points of optical market share year to date and expects further gains in 2026. Networking Platforms revenue rose 22% to $1.05 billion, driven by 19% Optical growth on a 72% RLS surge and 49% growth in Routing and Switching from DCOM demand. Ciena lifted its fiscal 2026 revenue outlook to $5.7-$6.1 billion, nearly 24% growth at the midpoint, up from the prior 17%, on strong demand from cloud, DCI, and AI infrastructure.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Buy Stock in the Mag 7 Hyperscalers or Are They Spending Too Much?\n\nShaun Pruitt\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAlthough they are among the world’s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\nThis includes Amazon AMZN , Alphabet GOOGL , Meta Platforms META , and Microsoft MSFT , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\n\nThere is no doubt that “hyperscaling” is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns Notably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billion.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nROIC Comparison With Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market’s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\nAmazon’s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance Magnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon’s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon’s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\n\nStory Continues\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts Amazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500’s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Title": "Why 2026 could be Waymo's year",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-2026-could-be-waymos-year-195850263.html",
      "Content": "Why 2026 could be Waymo's year\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:58 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nUBER\n\nZK\n\nFrom Los Angeles to Austin to Atlanta, Waymo robotaxis are everywhere. And 2026 could be the year Waymo expands its lead in the space.\nWaymo, part of Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), began in 2009 as an in-house startup within Google's X initiative and officially became Waymo in 2016. In 2018, Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker's I-Pace EV for its testing. This is the vehicle most users are accustomed to seeing.\n\nSince 2020, anyone in its service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that it performs around 250,000 trips a week and has performed 20 million trips since the service began.\nBut those numbers are likely to jump, perhaps big-time. The company is targeting around 1 million rides a week by the end of 2026 — four times its current volume.\nWhy 2026 could be a big year for Waymo In 2026, Waymo will enter its most aggressive expansion phase yet, moving beyond its current territories to tackle more US cities and international markets.\nCurrently, Waymo has robotaxi fleets in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta, where users can summon vehicles using Waymo's app or from partners like Uber ( UBER ) in Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe plan for 2026 moves beyond those areas, eventually adding 20 new markets. Waymo says it is progressing in test areas in the South, including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, with full service expected to begin in early 2026.\nIn the West, the company plans to add Las Vegas and San Diego, with targeted service start dates in 2026.\nIn the Northeast, Waymo is testing in Detroit and Washington, D.C., also for 2026 launches, and added Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis to the list earlier this month. The difficulties with northern cities, which are prone to inclement weather and conditions like snow that could block the cars' sensors, is of particular importance. Each of these cities will begin Waymo service with human operators before scaling up to driverless. The human operator sits the driver's seat and takes over if needed.\n\nThe company is also testing in highly populous areas like New York City , which requires special permitting and will likely take a much longer time to ramp up to official service. The company did not give a targeted start date for New York City service. Waymo is also scheduled to add service in London, its first international market, starting sometime in 2026, and has been testing in Tokyo since April.\nFor its part, Tesla ( TSLA ), which operates a ride-hailing service service with safety occupants, has only been in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area since mid-2025 but will supposedly expand in Nevada and Phoenix next year.\n\nStory Continues\nTo meet these goals, the company is expanding its manufacturing facilities. Waymo, along with its manufacturing parter Magna, will expand its new plant in Arizona to double production and build more than 2,000 vehicles at the facility by the end of 2026.\nThe company will begin to assemble its next-generation robotaxi on Zeekr's RT platform, with the stated goal of building \"tens of thousands\" of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year.\n\nWall Street is mostly in favor.\n\"Waymo is furthest along in true driverless deployment: it is already operating fully autonomous ride-hail services in parts of Phoenix, San Francisco (Bay Area), Los Angeles, and testing in additional US cities, with no safety driver in the vehicle for many rides,\" Deutsche Bank's Edison Yu wrote in early December. \"These are limited geofence, high CAPEX operations, but they prove the technical feasibility of Level 4 autonomy in constrained urban zones.\"\nBut Yu added that Waymo's tech \"stack\" is heavily dependent on costly equipment like lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors, radar, and cameras, and is map-dependent, which slows scaling speed and pushes up the per-vehicle cost.\nMorgan Stanley's robotics research team, now led by longtime analyst Adam Jonas, agrees that Waymo's tech, though impressive, will be held back by higher costs compared to Tesla, which uses a vision-only system powered by a neural network, essentially acting like a robotic driver.\nIn Waymo's defense, the company and analysts like Deutsche Bank's Yu argue that the complement of sensors and cameras helps with reliability and safety.\nWaymo's data shows its robotaxis are involved in fewer accidents involving serious injury, airbag deployment, or any injury, for that matter, compared to human drivers. In fact, a human driver is five times more likely to be involved in an accident resulting in an injury compared to a Waymo robotaxi (0.8 crashes per 1 million miles in Waymo vs 3.96 crashes per 1 million miles with a human driver).\n\nThough details are still scarce, Tesla data via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shows Tesla robotaxis had seven crashes in 250,000 miles, implying a crash rate of around 28 crashes per 1 million miles.\nPublic safety is also a key regulatory challenge facing both Waymo and Tesla, with permitting across various municipalities complicated to navigate and possible overarching federal guidelines that the NHTSA hinted may be coming.\n\nAnd though not a passenger safety concern, the electrical blackout on Dec. 20 in San Francisco led to embarrassing \"bricking\" of Waymo robotaxis , leaving them stuck in the middle of streets, unable to move due to traffic signals being inoperative. Incidents like these are headaches for municipalities, though Waymo promises a software update will alleviate these incidents.\n\nNevertheless, passenger safety is most important, and Waymo's data reporting showing its strong safety record will help cities looking to test robotaxis in their jurisdictions, as well as win over the public, which may be open to but skeptical about riding in driverless cars.\nWaymo's own ubiquitousness may also help in its rollout. While a survey performed by the Verge in April 2024 found that, overall, 45% of respondents believed robotaxi services were safe (compared to 37% against), the percentages were actually higher in cities where Waymo was already operating (54% for and 32% against).\nA recent survey conducted in San Francisco this past July found that ​​67% of San Francisco residents now support the operation of driverless robotaxis, up from 44% in 2023, with \"net favorability\" of robotaxis swinging from -7% in late 2023 to +38% in mid-2025.\nPras Subramanian is Lead Auto Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Why anchoring 2026 portfolios in Big Tech and cybersecurity is the way to go\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWD\n\nGOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nANET\n\nThe next phase of the AI trade is more about growth and survival than simply chasing the most coveted names.\n\"I definitely wouldn't just bet on Nvidia,\" Adam Coons, chief investment officer at Winthrop Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. \"We kind of like to barbell this with something like the big hyperscaler, like an Alphabet Google, because that's really the type of name that you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because the AI story is just benefitting an already existing business model that was doing well.\"\nThe \"barbell\" strategy is born out of a growing skepticism toward \"one-trick ponies.\" In this case, Coons says it applies to companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), and Palantir ( PLTR ), which rely almost exclusively on the current AI hardware rush.\n\nWhile these names have led the market higher, their valuations have reached a point where \"margin of safety\" is effectively zero. In Coons's view, when a stock is priced to perfection, even a minor earnings miss can trigger a catastrophe.\n\"You need to position size,\" he said.\nBy anchoring a portfolio in \"behemoth hyperscalers\" like Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ), investors get exposure to AI through companies with diversified cash flows. Such companies aren't just AI plays, but are advertising and software giants that use AI to optimize businesses that were already succeeding.\n\nIf the \"safe\" end of the barbell is Big Tech, the other side is \"growth,\" and it can be found in the infrastructure required to keep those systems running and secure.\n\"Down the chain, we like the things that overall the AI story will help prop up,\" Coons said. \"For us, it's cybersecurity [as it] becomes more and more important.\"\nHe added that Fortinet ( FTNT ) and CrowdStrike ( CRWD ) are among \"two of our top picks on the security side.\"\nAs AI advances, so does the risk for hacking, Coons noted. Cybersecurity isn't a discretionary expense, but a tax on the digital age that must be paid. Unlike the volatile demand for graphics processing units, the need for protection is more predictable.\nThe sector isn't without its risks, however. CrowdStrike faced a global IT outage in July 2024, caused by a faulty software update. It prompted the \"blue screens of death\" across 8.5 million machines, including airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nCoons says the final piece of the 2026 investor blueprint is disciplined position sizing. He suggests building a \"basket\" of smaller, high-conviction names — like Reddit ( RDDT ), which he views as a unique data play for AI training — but with the caveat of keeping those positions small.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to Coons, the average investor should steer clear of trying to find the next Nvidia. The low-hanging fruit has been picked, and winning 2026 is more about leaning into the giants that own the platforms and the specialists who protect the data.\nAdditionally, Chris Versace, chief investment officer at Tematica Research, sees Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) and Arista Networks ( ANET ) as the next logical steps in the AI revolution.\n\nVersace argues that the massive spending on data centers is creating a \"network congestion\" problem. As AI usage explodes, the connection between chips becomes the new bottleneck.\n\"It's the network connection that will be the big bottleneck that I think folks are missing,\" Versace notes, pointing to Marvel because of its dominance in optical and networking hardware.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Although nine publicly traded American companies have achieved a valuation of $1 trillion or more, only four have graduated into the $3 trillion club.\nAmazon is an incredibly diverse technology company, with a dominant market position in industries like e-commerce, cloud computing, and more.\nThe tech titan could join the $3 trillion club in 2026 thanks to a combination of its attractive valuation and its strong earnings growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nNine publicly traded American companies are worth $1 trillion or more, but only four have graduated into the exclusive $3 trillion club so far: Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , and Microsoft .\nI think Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could join them by the end of 2026 thanks to the accelerating revenue growth in its cloud computing division, and the surging profits in its legacy e-commerce business. The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Forget High‑Risk AI Penny Stocks: This Established AI Leader Is a Safer Long‑Term Bet\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Many new AI companies are making big promises without much progress to show for it.\nAlphabet's massive quantity of data from its businesses gives it an advantage in training AI.\nIt also has nearly $99 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at its disposal.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been around for a while, but it has undoubtedly leaped into the mainstream with the popularity of generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT. With this new surge of excitement and interest, we've seen legacy companies pivot to making AI a focal part of their business, and plenty of newer AI companies hit the scene with big promises.\nThe issue is that the AI boom has ushered in a lot of AI stocks that are headed nowhere fast. And unfortunately, they're taking investors along for the ride as people search for the \"next big thing\" in the bargain bin via penny stocks. There's seemingly no shortage of AI penny stocks in the market right now.\nYet, these stocks often come with more risk than is needed for someone looking to invest in AI and take advantage of the emerging technology. Instead, it's wise to go with an established AI leader that has stood the test of time and continues to be at the forefront of innovation.\nA full-stack AI company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) might be best known for Google and YouTube, but it has plenty of other businesses and ventures under its umbrella that operate in virtually all phases of the AI pipeline outside of manufacturing AI chips.\nTo begin, DeepMind is an AI research lab that has made breakthroughs that modern AI relies on. This gives Alphabet in-house access to some of the smartest people in the field. It also owns dozens of data centers (and plans to build plenty more), allowing it to process the massive amounts of data its AI needs.\n\nAlphabet designs its own advanced AI chips, reducing its reliance on companies like Nvidia , which charges premiums and could have issues meeting demand in the near future. It has its own cloud platform, Google Cloud, which is currently the third largest in the world by market share.\nThen there's Alphabet's consumer-facing applications, like Gemini, and its ecosystem of software products that allow it to integrate its AI models into tools people already use daily.\nAlphabet has a key advantage not easily replicated One thing working in Alphabet's favor when it comes to its AI tools is the amount of data it has.\nGoogle Search is essentially the gateway to the internet, collecting billions of questions and getting an inside look into what people are interested in; YouTube has billions of hours of data that give insight into what people enjoy watching and what topics are trending; and Maps has tons of data on how the world moves and the places people are interested in.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's only a few sources, too. There's also the Android operating system that is on billions of phones, and Gmail, which millions of people use. AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and Alphabet has more data than virtually any other company in the world.\nWith its data advantage, Alphabet has a chance to make its AI models the most accurate and nuanced of all.\n\nNo penny stock can compete with Alphabet's finances One thing you'll never have to second-guess with Alphabet is its ability to make money. In the third quarter, it generated $102.3 billion in revenue (up 16% year over year and its first-ever $100 billion quarter), and its net income totaled nearly $35 billion (up 33% year over year). Both of those have grown impressively over the past five years.\nAlphabet is a certified cash cow, with nearly $99 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, giving it the capital to continue investing in its AI infrastructure and capabilities. That's what I'd look for in an AI stock instead of essentially gambling on penny stocks, hoping that it works out.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Why the electrical grid needs more software\n\nTim De Chant\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nOne of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was … nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background.\nThat low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch.\n\nElectricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including repurposing supersonic jet engines for data center duty and working on beaming solar power down from space .\nAnd that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is projected to nearly triple in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled consumer frustration around pricing and drawn the ire of environmental groups that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.\n\nThis confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.\nFor example, startups like Gridcare and Yottar argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.\nGridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amidst the data center boom.\nSeveral other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.\n\nBase Power, for example, is building one in Texas by leasing batteries to homeowners at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.\n\nStory Continues\nOther startups including Texture, Uplight, and Camus are developing software layers to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.\nThere’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid.\n\nNvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to develop industry-specific models in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is working with the grid operator PJM to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.\nThese changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold.\nUtilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability.\nSoftware, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction.\nAnd that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It’s cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL)).\n\nDon't Miss:\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nWhen Time Away Lost Its Appeal Brin said he retired about a month before COVID hit, with plans to sit in cafés and study physics. When routines disappeared, he said he was \"kind of stewing\" without a technical outlet and felt mentally disengaged.\nAs Alphabet gradually allowed a limited number of employees back into offices, he began returning more often. That return led to deeper involvement in internal AI work, including Google's Gemini AI models, which he said was \"very rewarding.\" Brin said staying retired \"would've been a big mistake.\"\n\nHow Google Reached Its AI Crossroads Brin also offered a direct assessment of Google's AI trajectory. He said the company underinvested after publishing the 2017 Transformer research paper, which later became foundational for many large language models.\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\n\nHe told Widom that internal caution slowed broader releases because of concerns that chatbots could \"say dumb things.\" While Google held back, competitors moved faster. Brin said OpenAI \"ran with it,\" a move that accelerated public adoption of generative AI tools.\nEven so, he said Google benefited from long-term investment in neural-network research, custom-built chips, and large-scale data centers . Brin said very few companies operate across the full AI stack at that scale, including in-house research, proprietary semiconductors, and global computing infrastructure.\nWhy He Urges Students To Stay Technical Asked how students should prepare for careers shaped by AI, Brin cautioned against abandoning technical fields. He said choosing a different discipline simply because AI can write code misses how broadly those systems already operate.\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\n\"I wouldn't go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,\" he said.

      "Content": "Why Alphabet Just Paid $4.75 Billion for Intersect -- and What It Means for the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Intersect specializes in energy management solutions for data centers.\nBuilding an AI data center requires more than just chips and servers -- efficient energy solutions are also needed.\nAs the AI infrastructure era kicks off, investors should expect to see more capital flow toward the energy space.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nIt's been a busy period for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . In mid-November, investors learned that Warren Buffett's investment conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway , took a $4 billion stake in the internet giant during the third quarter. Subsequently, shares soared to new all-time highs.\nThen on Dec. 22, Alphabet announced a definitive agreement to acquire Intersect, a provider of data center and energy infrastructure solutions, for $4.75 billion. As Alphabet continues to push the frontiers of all things artificial intelligence (AI), investors may be wondering how the Intersect deal fits into the company's long-term roadmap.\nLet's dig into why this deal represents a savvy move by Alphabet, and unpack what it could mean for the broader AI infrastructure movement.\nWhat does Intersect do, and why is it important? When it comes to AI-related capital expenditures (capex), most investors immediately think of graphics processing units (GPUs), server architecture, and other networking gear hosted inside data centers. While these costs are indeed important, the rising expenses of procuring chips are only part of the equation.\n\nIntersect develops utility-scale renewable energy solutions for data centers. The company places various sources of power generation, such as wind, solar, and battery, alongside data centers. This co-location strategy allows Intersect to power its infrastructure efficiently, bypassing long wait times associated with new facilities accessing the U.S. electrical grid.\nWhy did Alphabet acquire Intersect? One of the biggest drains on gross margins for AI developers is the rising cost of energy. As AI workloads continue to grow, investors can expect training and inference costs to multiply exponentially from their current levels .\nAlphabet is trying to hedge against these headwinds by gaining control over its future energy costs. Tucking Intersect into its ecosystem allows Alphabet to access data center capacity more efficiently than relying on external utility providers. This will become increasingly important as the company brings new products and services online to its Gemini model and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\nInvestors should not be surprised by Alphabet's decision to acquire Intersect. The company already employs a vertically integrated business model across its search, cloud, advertising, and consumer electronics businesses.\n\nStory Continues\nWhether it's furthering research in quantum computing through DeepMind, accelerating the production of its custom Tensor Processing Unit chips, or refining the algorithms powering search across Google and YouTube, Alphabet's core assets are stitched together by the same thread: artificial intelligence.\n\nIntersect represents another layer of Alphabet's vertically integrated model, providing the company with greater cost visibility as well as critical flexibility around the future of its infrastructure buildouts.\nWhat does the Intersect deal signal about AI infrastructure? For the last three years, chip companies such as Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , and Broadcom have raced to design cutting-edge hardware to serve as the backbone of generative AI development. While demand for next-generation chips isn't waning by any stretch of the imagination, most hyperscalers realize that AI accelerators will eventually become commoditized.\n\nIn my eyes, Alphabet's acquisition of Intersect already signals that these dynamics are in motion. Although chip procurement remains a priority, Alphabet is getting a head start in laying the groundwork to lower the overall cost of compute and improve the flow of data within GPU clusters by acquiring Intersect.\nThis deal suggests that hyperscalers will not be able to afford to rely on incremental improvements from GPU developers and external power providers in the long run. In a broader sense, this move by Alphabet signals that the AI infrastructure era will feature much more than new chips.\nOver the next several years, I suspect more players in big tech will follow a similar playbook to that of Alphabet and begin accelerating investment in the energy infrastructure space -- diversifying their AI budgets beyond new chips and interconnect gear.\n\nUltimately, I believe the biggest winners of the AI revolution will be those who control all aspects of the value chain, from hardware and software design to the costs associated with energy management and infrastructure development.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

The question is which one fits your risk tolerance.\nPure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum QBTS are lottery tickets with better odds. They’re not competing with the Magnificent Seven; they’re auditioning to be acquired by them. If one of these companies cracks a genuine commercial advantage, it becomes a buyout target overnight. High risk; asymmetric upside.\n\nThe Mag Seven are already in: Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN have billion-dollar quantum programs. So does IBM IBM. You’re not betting on whether they’ll participate. You’re betting on whether quantum becomes material to their earnings this decade. Safer, but the quantum upside is diluted by everything else in the stock.\nInfrastructure is where the near-term money lives. Post-quantum cryptography is already a compliance issue. NIST standardized new algorithms in 2024, and every government contractor, bank and defense company needs to upgrade. That’s not speculative.

That’s the holy grail physicists have chased for 30 years. The chip showed that scaling up qubit arrays, from 3×3 to 5×5 to 7×7, reduced error rates instead of compounding them. That’s never happened before.\n\nThree weeks later, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in topological qubits. Amazon’s Ocelot chip cut error-correction costs by 90%. IBM confirmed it’s on track for a 100,000-qubit system by 2029. A University of Chicago professor called it “escape velocity.”\nYou’re right that quantum computing was vaporware for decades. So was AI. In 2020, experts said artificial general intelligence was 50 years away. In 2024, AI writes code, passes the bar exam and diagnoses cancer better than radiologists.\nThe difference between “decades away” and “here” is usually about 18 months of denial.\nStill skeptical after all these years,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best time to invest in a technology is when smart people still think it’s a fantasy.\nDear Charlie, North Korea stole $2 billion in crypto in 2024. When quantum computing matures, all encryption is at risk. What makes you think bitcoin BTCUSD survives?\nAlex\nDear Alex, You’re conflating two different problems: hackers and hardware.\nNorth Korea didn’t crack bitcoin’s cryptography. It compromised employees. The Bybit heist, around $1.5 billion, came from social engineering and insider access, not supercomputers. That’s not a quantum threat. That’s a human one.\nNow, the real question: What happens when quantum computers can break elliptic curve cryptography?\n\nAnswer: Everything breaks. Not just bitcoin. Google, Microsoft, the U.S. Federal Reserve, every bank, every military system, every government database on earth. If quantum computing cracks bitcoin, it’s already cracked the entire digital infrastructure of modern civilization. Bitcoin isn’t the first domino. It’s somewhere around the 40th.\nBut here’s what the doomsayers miss: bitcoin upgrades. The U.S. government’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) — the same agency that sets the standards for everything from weights and measures to cybersecurity — standardized quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms in 2024.\nThe bitcoin network can migrate to post-quantum signatures. Active coins move to new addresses with new encryption.\n\nLost bitcoins, including founder Satoshi’s, stay frozen in old addresses. That’s roughly 4 million coins in vulnerable P2PK addresses that become unspendable. Security goes up. Circulating supply goes down. That’s not a death sentence for bitcoin. That’s a supply shock.\nTimeline? Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang says 15 to 30 years before quantum computers can break current encryption. Bitcoin security expert Jameson Lopp estimates bitcoin needs five to 10 years to complete a migration. The math works.\nQuantum computing is a threat to everything. That’s exactly why it isn’t a special threat to bitcoin.\nWatching the sausage get made,\nCharlie\nP.S. North Korea’s hackers don’t need quantum physics. They just need your password.\nDear Charlie, Horizon scanning is no longer optional. First movers will be those who translate technical complexity into business strategy.\nDon’t you agree?\nSarah\nDear Sarah, Exactly right. The companies that win won’t be the ones with the most qubits. They’ll be the ones who figure out what to do with them first.\nQubits are a vanity metric. Error-corrected, commercially viable quantum systems are the real race. The winners will be the ones that turn physics experiments into recurring revenue.\n\nYou’re right that horizon scanning is no longer optional. The companies that spot quantum’s commercial applications first will own the decade. The ones still waiting for proof of concept will be writing case studies about what they missed.\nEyes on the horizon,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best business strategies are written by people who understand what the technology can’t do yet.\nDear Charlie, You’re right that “wafer-scale cryogenic integration” makes investment decisions difficult. But when the railroad was hard to explain, the travelers were few.\nWhen it worked, they were 100 times more numerous. I’m buying the complexity.\nPierre\nDear Pierre, You understand something most investors don’t: The more revolutionary the technology, the harder it is to evaluate. “Wafer-scale cryogenic integration” doesn’t fit in a spreadsheet.\nNeither did “horseless carriage” in 1905.\nThe best investors in transformational technologies aren’t the ones who understand physics. They’re the ones who understand the implications.\n\nYou’re buying the complexity. I’m right there with you.\nFellow traveler,\nCharlie\nP.S. Nobody who bought Standard Oil stock could explain fractional distillation either.\nHe has no position in any of the companies or investments mentioned in this article.\n\nMore from Charlie Garcia:\nQuantum computing is the stock market’s next big tech play — and these stocks are still cheap\nChina is quietly destroying the dollar — and that’ll cost you. Fight back with these money moves.\nThe real money in AI chips is in these stocks — and you’ve probably never heard of them\nThe dollar is losing the world’s respect — but you’re losing much more\nMost Read from MarketWatch Here are the ideas that could really help solve America’s affordability crisis in 2026\n‘I completely trust her’: Should I name my daughter as beneficiary on all my accounts — or add her name instead?\nHow the New Year’s tax deadline poses a risk for gold, silver and the Dow\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Those systems could eventually break many forms of current encryption, raising concerns that data stolen today could be decoded later, a practice often described as harvest now, decrypt later.\nBy adopting new security tools ahead of formal global standards, Bahrain is aiming to reduce exposure before those risks become more immediate. The platform is intended to help agencies spot vulnerabilities and adjust protections over time as threats evolve.\nThe agreement also highlights growing government interest in AI-driven cybersecurity, as public institutions look to move from reactive responses toward earlier prevention.\nSandboxAQ emerged from Alphabet's internal research efforts and now operates as an independent company focused on enterprise and government security applications.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The project reflects growing global concern over harvest now, decrypt later attacks, in which hackers store encrypted data for future exploitation once quantum capabilities mature.\nThe deployment of SandboxAQ's AI driven system is one of the first national scale efforts to address quantum-era cybersecurity risks. Experts say the program demonstrates a proactive shift in government cybersecurity strategy prioritizing early defense and resilience rather than reacting to breaches.\nThe transaction with Bahrain shows that there is growing worldwide demand for sophisticated, AI based encryption and post quantum protection capabilities, according to SandboxAQ. Analysts think this step shows that governments are getting ready for the next wave of digital danger, even if quantum computing won't be widely used for a few more years.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Amazon stock could have nearly 50% upside in 2026\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nAmazon's ( AMZN ) stock has hardly had a prime performance in 2025.\nShares of the e-commerce and cloud giant are only up 6% year to date, badly lagging the 18% advance for the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ). Experts cite slowing sales growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) business and mixed sentiment on the company's ability to monetize artificial intelligence as the drivers of the \"mixed\" sentiment.\nAmazon didn't do much to bolster sentiment in October when it announced its largest-ever round of layoffs in its history, eliminating 14,000 corporate roles.\nThe stock is likely to close out the year with the unenviable award for worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" member.\n\nFor perspective, the top performer of the Magnificent Seven, Alphabet ( GOOG ), has surged 66% this year on the back of optimism for its new Gemini 3 model .\nBut Wall Street has stuck with Amazon, with some even putting it on their \"top picks\" lists for 2026.\nEvercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney wrote that he thinks Amazon has about 50% upside potential. He was one of the Street analysts slapping a top pick stamp on the stock.\n\nMahaney cited several catalysts coming into focus soon, including reaccelerating growth at AWS, demand for new Trainium AI chips, further strong growth in advertising revenue, and a ramp in the new Alexa+.\n\"At the end of the day, Amazon remains a high quality compounder (25% EPS compound annual growth rate), with solid double-digit revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and free cash flow likely to inflect up materially in a 24-month timeframe,\" Mahaney said.\nYahoo Finance data shows of the 67 sell-side analysts that cover Amazon, 96% rate the stock a Strong Buy or Buy. The average $295 price target for the Street assumes 27% upside from current levels.\nInput from Polymarket, a Yahoo Finance partner for prediction market data, reveals Main Street has a more skeptical take on the stock, however. About 96% of users think the stock will be little changed by the end of January 2026 compared to today.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth is in Mahaney's bull camp on Amazon, with a more subdued projection on the stock that estimates 30% upside potential.\nAnmuth's thesis on Amazon is similar to Mahaney's, though he noted that Amazon's new $38 billion, seven-year cloud services deal with OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) could \"add upside\" to the company's top line.\n\"Amazon is the most diversified mega-cap across revenues and profit and has various large growth opportunities — mixed sentiment and attractive valuation,\" Anmuth added.\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nTraini Raises $7.5 Million to Build Pet Emotional Intelligence\n\nBusiness Wire\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nXIACF\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif., December 29, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Palo Alto–based pet emotional intelligence startup Traini has announced the completion of a $7.5 million funding round , aiming to bridge the communication gap between humans and pets by developing intelligent systems capable of understanding pet emotions and intentions. The round was led by Banyan Tree , Silver Capital , ZhaoTai Group , and NYX Ventures , with participation from Starting Gate Fund , Jade Capital , and renowned tech investors including VPs from NVIDIA , Julian Qian (Member of technical staff at Anthropic) , Weihe Zheng (Founding Partner, Cowin Capital) , Jia He (Founding Partner, Nanshan Capital) , Peter Xu (CEO, Plug and Play China) , and Zach Zhang (Founding Partner, Edgewater Investments) . Existing investors Tao Foundation and Xiaomi Co-founder Feng Hong also participated. The proceeds will be used primarily for technology R&D, product iteration, and market expansion.\n\nPrior to this, Traini also received investments from senior management at Google, Meta, and Palo Alto Networks and institutional investment from FutureX Capital , BlueSea Partners , Tao Foundation , Mint Capital , and Valkyrie Fund .\nFollowing this round of financing, Traini will launch its first smart hardware product—the world’s first cognitive pet wearable , the Cognitive Smart Collar . This device is also the world’s first human–dog \"language\" translation device built on generative AI. It is now available for pre-order through the Traini App and the website, traini.app .\nTraini founder Arvin Sun stated, \"Our mission is to develop an intelligence that reignites the natural instincts of our furry companions and builds a true spiritual bond between pets and their humans.\" Traini’s founding team brings extensive experience from companies like OpenAI , Chewy , and ByteDance .\n\nTraini is the world’s first—and so far the only—technology company to translate pet behavior using multimodal generative AI. Its breakthrough technology has pioneered a new way for humans to communicate with their pets.\nThe defining feature of Traini’s product lies in its ability to enable real-time voice conversations through its proprietary multimodal models. Traini’s core product, PEBI (Pet Empathic Behavior Interface) , supports multimodal interaction across text, images, video, and audio. By analyzing pets’ vocalizations, facial expressions, and behaviors, PEBI delivers a precise understanding of pets’ psychological and emotional states and expresses them in a human-like conversational form—achieving true, two-way communication between humans and pets.\n\nStory Continues\nTraini’s models cover nearly 120 dog breeds, with emotion translation accuracy reaching up to 94% . PEBI can be applied to behavior translation, emotion recognition, personalized service matching, and pet-assisted healthcare diagnostics. In addition, Traini provides APIs to veterinary clinics and hardware companies, empowering medical services and intelligent device interactions. Traini has established deep partnerships with leading smartphone and electric vehicle brands, and soon users will be able to communicate with their pets in real time directly through mobile operating systems and in-car infotainment systems.\n\nIn product quality validation, beyond collaborating with pet behavior experts for extensive data annotation, Traini has innovatively adopted a \"human–pet vocal spectrogram comparison\" methodology. By using the spectrogram of human speech—captured when expressing corresponding emotions and intentions—as a baseline, Traini compares it against pet vocal patterns to enhance emotional mapping accuracy.\nTraini‘s smart dog collar integrates advanced AI with real-time emotion tracking. It is powered by Traini’s proprietary Valence–Arousal model, 3D Pet Emotion Model and Instant Emotion Vector . Developed in close collaboration with pet behaviorists, the model is built upon insights from more than 900 peer-reviewed studies in animal behavior and trained on behavioral data from over 2 million dogs . Designed to deepen emotional bonds between pets and their owners, the Cognitive Smart Collar helps pet parents gain a richer understanding of their dogs’ emotional well-being and overall mental health.\n\nThe collar's most remarkable feature lies in its ability to autonomously identify and track kinds of emotional states in dogs, including joy, anxiety, excitement, and distress. Translating them into human-understandable language enables real-time, meaningful two-way communication — including vocalizations, emotions, behaviors, and even what the dog \"wants to say.\" Using a combination of sound analysis from the dog’s barks and vital signals like heart rate, temperature, and body movement, Traini’s AI-powered collar interprets these data points to provide a comprehensive emotional profile of the pet. Traini's collar offers actionable feedback that can enhance the bond between owner and pet.\nBeyond everyday care, the collar also has significant potential in the realm of pet healthcare. By continuously monitoring a dog’s emotional and physiological signals, it can help detect early signs of health issues.\n\nOn the user side, Traini has already served over 2 million dogs and received widespread coverage from major media and influencers. Its videos on YouTube have surpassed 70 million views . In 2023, Traini launched PetGPT , a natural-language and behavior-analysis model with 99% coverage across users, improving service engagement by 70% . Earlier this year, it unveiled T-Agent , an AI-powered product recommendation and purchasing system that autonomously identifies dogs’ real needs—allowing pets to make decisions, with their owners acting as co-pilots . Traini now collaborates with nearly 40,000 local pet stores across the U.S.\nTo realize this vision, Traini had to overcome two major challenges: data scarcity and environmental complexity . Traini addressed these through multimodal fusion , integrating image, video, and audio data to train its PPI (Pet Perception and Interaction) model. Powered by transformers, PPI combines real-time perception, adaptive reasoning, and feedback generation.\n\nTraini also introduced a \"train-as-you-use\" mechanism , where every anonymized user-pet interaction feeds back into model training, enhancing personalization and continuously expanding the behavioral dataset. This approach strengthens the model’s precision while building a sustainable data moat. Traini has achieved breakthroughs at both data and model levels , developing a rich, high-quality pet audio-video dataset across multiple breeds, scenes, and emotions. As a result, users can detect early signs of pet stress, loneliness, or health risks, transforming Traini from a passive tool into an emotional interface for daily companionship.\nInvestors describe Traini as a breakthrough example of AI in vertical applications—where technology, empathy, and consumer experience converge.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251229406590/en/\nContacts\ntrainipet@gmail.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nMeta Platforms' AI Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\nMeta Platforms is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META&rsquo;s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META&rsquo;s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms&rsquo; initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company&rsquo;s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet and Amazon , are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space\n\nMeta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\nAlphabet&rsquo;s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon&rsquo;s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nMETA&rsquo;s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\nMeta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 24.6%.\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s 6.62X. META has a Value Score of C.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.16 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, suggesting 1.75% year-over-year growth.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc.

The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. , Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\nGlobal e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN&rsquo;s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon&rsquo;s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is &ldquo;Growing at a pace we haven&rsquo;t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we&rsquo;ve been focused on accelerating capacity &mdash; adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.&rdquo;\nExtensive AI Applications\n\nAmazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called &ldquo;Project Rainier.&rdquo; This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers&rsquo; queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\nAMZN&rsquo;s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance\nAmazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp.\nMicrosoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT&rsquo;s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company&rsquo;s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength\nMicrosoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN&rsquo;s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT&rsquo;s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company&rsquo;s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\n\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business\nGoogle Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon&rsquo;s AWS and Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\n\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions\nZacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

They have made bank in Mac 7. Uh not only this year, the year before and the year before that, maybe even a couple years before. They're they're sitting on a lot of gains is what I'm trying to say. What should they be doing right now with these gains?\n00:14 George\nGood morning, Brian. Can you imagine being a short seller in this market and trying to bet against the the Mag 7 or the AI trade or anything. I mean, you get carried out. Short selling's been like the worst uh possible thesis on the market you could have the last 15 years other than maybe going long oil and gas stocks. So I I I would not bet against any of any of these complexes, any of these movements. You want to talk about earnings growth, this market's got it. A lot of the other developed countries really don't. So betting against the US has been a fool's game and I'm certainly not going to be doing it in 2026. I'm going not I'm be going to not try to time the market. I'm going to try to stay in there, stay positions as is and just trim and reallocate as as wisdom would would dictate.\n01:05 Brian\nGeorge, I just had a a guest on uh I'm doing double duty here. I was in the 9:00 a.m. hour and they were making the case for healthcare. If you had to stack up these two sectors side by side, you got uh AI plays, you got the Mac 7, healthcare. What excites you more and why?\n01:22 George\nYeah, I don't really like any of those the best. I think healthcare's seen a significant rally in the closing parts of 2025. If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Broadcom, Vertiv and Alphabet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:58 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: VRT\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Broadcom AVGO, Vertiv VRT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n3 Leading AI Stocks Investors Can Buy for 2026\nThe market, and many leading AI stocks, are at an inflection point. In the near term, further volatility or even a pullback is possible. However, the longer-term opportunity remains compelling, with upside potential that extends well into 2026 and beyond.\n\nAI capital spending is projected to reach an estimated $571 billion in 2026, and Nvidia , Broadcom and Vertiv sit at the center of this historic infrastructure buildout. These companies are among the most critical enablers of the AI expansion.\nAfter running multiple screens focused on growth, valuation, and margin strength, these three names consistently rose to the top. Collectively, they represent exceptional businesses with durable competitive advantages and strong earnings power.\nDespite their leadership positions, these stocks are not stretched on valuation and in recent weeks have experienced earnings upgrades, giving two of them top Zacks Ranks.\nRecent months have been choppy in these stocks, with prices moving sideways to lower, leaving shares near technically important levels. Whether those levels hold or break in the short term is uncertain, but the risk-reward profile remains attractive at current prices regardless.\n\nEven if further downside materializes and bearish narratives resurface, any weakness is unlikely to persist given the scale and durability of AI-driven demand. If support holds, these stocks may already be positioning for their next leg higher.\nBelow, I will break down the recent developments, fundamental strength of these businesses and highlight a tactical trading plan using the technical charts.\nNvidia Stocks Breaks Out on Bullish Developments\nNvidia continues to anchor the AI boom as the critical infrastructure provider through its leadership in GPU technology. While 2025 was comparatively subdued for the now roughly $4.5 trillion semiconductor giant, with shares delivering a tidy 42% return, the company has remained firmly on offense.\nOver the past week, Nvidia advanced its largest acquisition to date, agreeing to acquire assets from AI chip startup Groq in a deal valued at approximately $20 billion. Groq, founded by former Google TPU architects, develops high-performance inference-focused silicon that competes in certain AI workloads. While Groq described the transaction as a &ldquo;non-exclusive licensing agreement,&rdquo; the deal includes the integration of Groq&rsquo;s CEO and senior leadership into Nvidia, signaling deeper strategic alignment.\n\nStory Continues\nFrom a competitive standpoint, the acquisition strengthens Nvidia&rsquo;s already formidable moat at the leading edge of AI semiconductors.\nFundamentals also continue to move in the right direction. Analysts have resumed raising earnings estimates, earning Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) . Consensus forecasts for next year&rsquo;s earnings have climbed nearly 16% over the past two months, and longer-term projections call for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years. At roughly 40.6x forward earnings, the valuation remains reasonable given Nvidia&rsquo;s growth profile and its central role in the most powerful technology cycle in more than a decade.\n\nThe technical picture has also improved meaningfully. After months of choppy, volatile trading marked by sharp rallies and pullbacks, NVDA has made a decisive bullish turn. During the low-volume holiday period, the stock broke out from a clear descending bullish wedge, marking its most constructive advance in several months. As long as shares hold above the breakout level, the setup points to further upside as 2026 begins.\nBroadcom Shares Consolidate at Key Price Level\nBroadcom has been a core beneficiary of the AI boom since the trend began, but its importance has become even more apparent in recent months. After being viewed as a relative laggard for several years, Alphabet has reasserted itself as a leader in AI and large language models. A major driver of that shift has been renewed appreciation for Alphabet&rsquo;s proprietary hardware stack, most notably its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which Google has deployed internally for nearly a decade.\n\nBroadcom plays a critical role in that ecosystem. While TPUs are branded as Google-designed chips, Broadcom provides the underlying expertise in ASIC design, networking, and high-speed I/O, effectively enabling Google to scale these systems reliably at hyperscale. As Alphabet rapidly expands AI infrastructure across Search, cloud services, and generative AI models, custom silicon becomes economically unavoidable. Broadcom sits squarely at the center of that transition, helping design chips optimized for inference, training, and internal workloads, areas where generic GPUs are often less cost-efficient. As Alphabet&rsquo;s AI leadership has become clearer, Broadcom&rsquo;s strategic importance has risen alongside it.\nFrom a fundamentals perspective, Broadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) , reflecting a pause in earnings revisions rather than any deterioration in outlook. Consensus estimates still call for 35.7% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, and the stock trades at roughly 36x one-year forward earnings. Given that growth profile and Broadcom&rsquo;s deep entrenchment in the AI infrastructure stack, valuation remains reasonable relative to peers.\n\nTechnically, Broadcom had been outperforming much of the AI complex in recent months as investors increasingly recognized its role within the Alphabet AI ecosystem. The sharp selloff following its most recent earnings report was less about weakening fundamentals and more about positioning and nuanced guidance, a classic &ldquo;sell-the-news&rdquo; event after a strong run. Importantly, shares found support at a level that has held up the stock since late summer. As long as that support holds, the consolidation looks constructive, and the near-term technical outlook remains encouraging.\nVertiv Stock Sits Within Trading Range\nVertiv remains one of the purest plays on the physical backbone of the AI buildout, supplying critical power, cooling, and thermal-management solutions to hyperscale and enterprise data centers. Recent developments continue to reinforce that positioning. Over the past several months, Vertiv has announced expanded partnerships with large data center operators and hyperscalers, while management has highlighted strong backlog growth and improving visibility tied directly to AI-driven capacity expansion. Demand for high-density cooling solutions continues to exceed expectations as next-generation AI workloads push power and thermal limits higher.\n\nFundamentally, the story remains compelling. Vertiv currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates continue to trend higher. Consensus forecasts call for 30.2% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, reflecting operating leverage, improving margins, and sustained AI-related demand. While the stock trades at a 40.6x forward earnings multiple, that valuation appears justified given Vertiv&rsquo;s growth rate, expanding addressable market, and increasingly important role in AI infrastructure.\nThe technical setup adds another layer of appeal. After a sharp advance earlier in the cycle, VRT has spent recent months consolidating within a well-defined trading range. Importantly, the stock recently bounced cleanly off support within its rising channel. The key level to watch on the upside is the ~$180 area, which marks the top of the current range. A decisive breakout above that level would likely signal the next leg higher, while continued support near the lower end of the channel keeps the risk-reward profile attractive.\n\nTaken together, Vertiv offers a differentiated way to participate in the AI boom&mdash;not through chips or software, but through the indispensable infrastructure that makes large-scale AI deployment possible. With fundamentals strengthening and the technical picture improving, VRT remains well positioned as investors look ahead to 2026.\nShould Investors Buy Shares in VRT, NVDA and AVGO?\nTaken together, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Vertiv offer complementary exposure to the core layers of the AI buildout&mdash;compute, custom silicon and networking, and physical infrastructure. While near-term volatility is always possible, fundamentals, earnings momentum, and long-term demand visibility remain firmly intact. With each stock positioned at a critical point in the AI value chain and trading near technically important levels, the current setup favors accumulation opportunistically as the AI investment cycle extends into 2026 and beyond.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The tail end of 2025 hasn’t been kind to the shares, as they are down by 7.9% since the start of November. The past couple of months have seen reports of an AI bubble, and the strength of Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) chips make rounds in the media. Google’s chips are cheaper to use than NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s products. However, more recently, the stock has benefited after reports have suggested that the firm will be able to ship its H200 GPUs to China. These chips have been a thorny issue in 2025 after the Trump administration restricted their sale.

Since it's an established and highly successful business, it's less risky than many hot tech stocks . Although it's already worth $3.8 trillion (as of Dec. 26), this company still has plenty of room to grow for one key reason.\nAlphabet is increasing its share of the AI market Once seen as a potential threat to Alphabet and its Google Search business, AI has become an important part of the tech giant's success. Google's AI assistant, Gemini, had 650 million monthly active users in the third quarter of 2025, according to Alphabet's earnings report. That's up from 450 million in July.\n\nIn that earnings report, Alphabet also reported that its first-party models, including Gemini, processed 7 billion tokens per minute. For perspective, OpenAI (the developer of ChatGPT) announced in October that its API platform processes 6 billion tokens per minute.\nThis is just one metric, and it's entirely possible that OpenAI soon announces it's processing 8 billion tokens per minute. Regardless, it's a sign that Google is attracting users to its AI products. Gemini's market share has also more than tripled over the last year, from 5.4% to 18.2%, according to Similarweb.\nAlphabet is integrating AI across all its business segments. Its most successful business in terms of revenue, Google Search, now offers AI Overviews and AI Mode. AI Overviews reached over 2 billion monthly users earlier this year. The tech giant also has AI-powered ad tools.\n\nAlphabet is one of the larger positions in my own portfolio, and I've added to it regularly. It's highly profitable (net income was $35 billion in Q3 2025), which provides a good degree of security, and its AI advancements set it up well for the future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Investing in These 3 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Right Now Could Set You Up for Life\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:57 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nWMT\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms continues to dominate with its social networks while exploring AI glasses, which can become a lucrative revenue stream.\nInteractive Brokers is one of the top beneficiaries of surging interest among investors who want to beat the stock market.\nWalmart's online ads continue to gain momentum and can yield higher profit margins in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Interactive Brokers Group ›\n\nInvesting in high-quality growth stocks and gradually building your positions can turn you into a millionaire investor. It takes a while to achieve that goal, and some people look beyond the S&P 500 index to amplify their returns. These are some of the most promising stocks that can produce appealing long-term returns.\nMeta Platforms is still a top-tier ad platform Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the second-largest advertising stock , only behind Google. However, Facebook's parent company has been reporting higher financial growth rates than Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which gives it an edge for new investors.\nTop-line results continue to expand, based on the company's 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter. Meta Platforms also recently launched its AI glasses, which may turn into a valuable revenue source that diversifies the company's finances in a few years.\n\nSocial media growth remains strong, with the company reporting 3.54 billion daily active users in Q3, which represents an 8% year-over-year increase. Continued demand for Meta Platforms' family of apps will yield more ad impressions and sales.\nInteractive Brokers is riding strong demand from investors When people make more stock trades and use margin to boost their exposure to equities, brokerage firms like Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ: IBKR) come out as the big winners. Shares are up by more than 40% year to date and have more than quadrupled over the past five years. Recent earnings results suggest that the momentum can continue.\n\nInteractive Brokers increased its total revenue by more than 20% year over year in Q3, with commission revenue and net interest income as two of the biggest winners. Strong engagement drove these results, with customer account growth increasing by 32% year over year. Interactive Brokers added 4.13 million accounts while delivering stock and options trading volume gains of 67% and 27% year over year, respectively.\nInvestors are still feeling good about the stock market based on a 39% year-over-year increase in Interactive Brokers' customer margin loans. Strong demand for the stock market should help the brokerage firm continue to outperform the S&P 500 and deliver millionaire-maker returns.\n\nStory Continues\nWalmart's pivot to advertising is a long-term tailwind that will boost margins Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) has made its mark as the world's top retailer and has a real shot at exceeding a $1 trillion market cap in 2026. The company continues to boost sales and delivered 5.8% year-over-year revenue growth for investors in Q3 FY26.\nHowever, the company's advertising segment is addressing one of Walmart's biggest weaknesses. Walmart enjoys high order volumes but struggles with profit margins. The company's net margins usually hover near 3% since retail stocks aren't known for high margins. Ads can be a game changer, especially since Walmart reported 53% year-over-year revenue growth for its global advertising business.\n\nAds don't make up a large portion of Walmart's total business, but they can grow over time and boost margins. In the meantime, Walmart continues to gain market share in retail while expanding its e-commerce sales, which were up by 27% year over year. Each Walmart store acts as a distribution facility, which results in lower shipping costs and quicker deliveries.\nFew companies can compete with Walmart in terms of size, and that works well for investors who want millionaire-maker stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Interactive Brokers Group right now? Before you buy stock in Interactive Brokers Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Interactive Brokers Group wasn’t one of them.

This can make investing in quantum computing businesses a high-risk, high-reward proposition suitable for only a small portion of a diversified portfolio.\nInvestors can approach this sector in two primary ways: through established tech giants or pure-play start-ups. The former offer a more stable entry point, as quantum computing is only a small part of their diversified operations. This approach can limit the impact of quantum-specific volatility on your overall investment.\nOn the other hand, pure-play quantum computing stocks can be highly speculative, early-stage companies whose stock prices are often volatile and tied to technological breakthroughs and future potential rather than current profits, but which could deliver higher returns if successful.\nOn today's list, I've included one quantum computing stock from each bucket for long-term investors to consider. Let's dive right in.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , through its Google Quantum AI division, is a leader in developing quantum computing technology focused on creating a large-scale, error-corrected quantum computer for solving problems currently impossible for classical supercomputers. Its recent work has led to significant breakthroughs, including the Willow quantum chip.\n\nThe Willow chip, unveiled in late 2024, has achieved two major milestones. First, it can significantly reduce error rates as more qubits (quantum bits, the basic units of quantum information) are added, which is a crucial step for building a scalable and reliable quantum computer. In October 2025, Google Quantum AI announced a breakthrough algorithm called Quantum Echoes run on the Willow hardware that generated a calculation demonstrably faster (13,000x) than any classical supercomputer.\nThe algorithm also achieved verifiable quantum advantage, which means it is repeatable and can be checked by other quantum systems. The work on the Quantum Echoes algorithm is a major step toward practical applications.\nPotential uses range from drug discovery and medicine to materials science. Google Quantum AI is pursuing a six-milestone roadmap to build a large error-corrected quantum computer with a goal of 1 million qubits. The division regularly collaborates with universities and national labs to provide access to their processors via the Google Cloud platform.\n\nStory Continues\nUnlike smaller pure-play quantum computing companies that require constant fundraising, Alphabet can leverage immense profits from its core advertising and Google Cloud businesses to fund decades of research without pressure for immediate commercial viability. A key challenge in quantum computing is error correction. The Willow chip was designed to exponentially reduce errors as qubits are added, which is a major technical advance over competitors.\n\nThe company's vision includes integrating future quantum computing capabilities into its existing AI ecosystem and Google Cloud platforms. In the third quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew 16% year over year to $102.3 billion, and net income climbed 33% to about $35 billion. The company is also a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), which is driving real business results and driving heavy investment in data centers and custom chips.\nAlphabet maintains a virtually unassailable financial position, with a strong balance sheet including $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities , and low debt too. Long-term investors who want to add wealth-building stocks to their portfolio should certainly consider taking a position in this business.\n\n2. IonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) IonQ is a leading pure-play quantum computing company that utilizes trapped-ion technology to build high-performance quantum systems. Unlike competitors like Alphabet and International Business Machines that primarily use superconducting qubits, IonQ's approach leverages naturally occurring, identical trapped ions as qubits.\n\nBy using naturally stable atoms that are isolated in a vacuum, IonQ's qubits are less susceptible to environmental noise and decoherence. In short, this can lead to fewer errors and more reliable results.\nIn October 2025, IonQ achieved 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, a critical industry benchmark that essentially means its quantum computers can perform complex operations with extremely high accuracy. Every qubit in an IonQ system can directly interact with any other qubit. This slashes the computational overhead and errors required to move data between qubits.\nIonQ is actively collaborating with partners to solve complex problems in several sectors. The company is working on accelerated drug development workflows with companies like AstraZeneca and Nvidia , it's partnered with Hyundai to use quantum AI for image recognition in self-driving cars, and even collaborated with Airbus to optimize high-complexity cargo loading problems.\n\nIonQ operates with an evolving business model that's designed to monetize its proprietary trapped ion technology through three primary avenues. One is through QCaaS, or Quantum Computing as a Service, a cloud-based model that lets major cloud providers like Amazon , Microsoft , and Google access quantum hardware, software, and tools remotely, much like traditional cloud services.\nAnother revenue source involves partnering with government agencies and enterprises for specialized quantum applications. IonQ is also expanding into quantum networking, sensing, and security after strategic 2025 acquisitions like Oxford Ionics and Vector Atomic.\nIn Q3, IonQ's revenue surged 222% year over year to $39.9 million. The company reported a substantial GAAP net loss of $1.1 billion, largely due to non-cash charges related to warrant liabilities and acquisition costs. Following a $2 billion equity offering in October, IonQ holds a pro forma cash balance of $3.5 billion and carries zero long-term debt.\n\nIonQ could enrich long-term investors if it successfully transitions from a high-growth speculative play to a dominant utility in the quantum era. It is currently the only pure-play public quantum company with triple-digit annual revenue growth and widespread cloud integration.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia's \"Aqui-Hire\" of Groq Eliminates a Potential Competitor and Marks Its Entrance Into the Non-GPU, AI Inference Chip Space\n\nBeth McKenna, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 12:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia is entering into a non-exclusive licensing agreement for Groq’s AI inference technology.\nNvidia's reportedly paying $20 billion for this deal, about three times Groq's most recent valuation.\nGroq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross -- who will join Nvidia along with other Groq personnel -- is widely considered the creator of Google’s TPU.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOn Friday, artificial intelligence (AI) chip start-up Groq announced via a very brief press release that it \"has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) for Groq's inference technology.\"\nThe deal also includes Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, Sunny Madra, Groq's president, and other members of the Groq team joining Nvidia to \"help advance and scale the licensed technology.\"\nThis was a smart move by Nvidia, in my view. Nvidia has tons of cash, and it makes sense to use it to accomplish two goals at once: eliminate a potential competitor and obtain a new chip technology to offer its customers.\nHere's what investors should know.\nAs close to an acquisition as it gets That Nvidia is not only entering into a non-exclusive license with Groq, but also hiring its founder-CEO, president, and reportedly key engineering talent, makes this deal an \"acqui-hire\" and as close to a full-fledged acquisition as possible.\nGranted, Groq will reportedly continue to operate, with its CFO taking over the CEO position, and operate its GroqCloud. However, with the founder -- who is the mastermind behind the company's tech -- leaving, it appears that all advancements in Groq's tech will now be made under Nvidia.\n\nNo doubt, Nvidia structured the deal to avoid potential regulatory scrutiny. The company already dominates the AI chip space, so any acquisition that could potentially increase its current or future market share further would likely garner a very close look from regulators.\nNvidia-Groq deal size The deal's size wasn't disclosed by the companies involved, but one major financial outlet has reported it at $20 billion, which would be Nvidia's largest deal to date, by far. Its prior largest deal was its $6.9 billion acquisition of high-performance networking specialist Mellanox Technologies in 2020. That acquisition proved to be extremely successful, as Nvidia's networking business is booming.\nIf the $20 billion is accurate, it represents a huge premium over Groq's most recent valuation. After a $750 million financing round in September, Groq's valuation was $6.9 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia tried to buy leading central processing unit (CPU) chip designer Arm Holdings in 2020, but that massive deal was called off due to significant antitrust concerns from regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nGroq's chip technology Groq's chips are language processing units (LPUs) designed for AI inferencing. Inferencing is the second step in the two-step AI process, following training. Training involves using vast amounts of data to teach an AI model, while inference is the deployment of that model to generate answers to a user's questions, images, and other outputs.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long dominated the AI training stage. They're also leaders in AI inference, but they face growing competition in this area. Competitors include Advanced Micro Devices ' (AMD) data center GPUs, as well as custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that Broadcom and Marvell Technology are making for big tech company customers. Until now, the big tech companies have just used their custom AI chips internally and, where applicable, also in their cloud computing services.\nHowever, it was recently revealed that social media giant Meta Platforms is considering buying Alphabet 's Google custom AI chip, called a tensor processing unit (TPU), for inferencing purposes in its data centers.\n\nThe big tech companies are exploring alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs for two reasons: to reduce costs and to diversify their supply chains. Relying on just a single supplier for anything can be risky.\nGroq's goal was for its LPUs to be a big player in the AI inference market. The company claims its technology is faster than alternatives for specific inference applications. Its plans included selling its chips for less money than Nvidia GPUs and perhaps other offerings.\nIt makes good sense that Nvidia views Groq's tech as potentially very valuable and evidently viewed the company as a potential, significant future rival. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross is widely considered the creator of Google's TPU. Granted, he didn't create this chip alone, but he was the force behind the effort to develop it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "2026 will be 'year of autonomous': Analyst on Tesla, Waymo robotaxis\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: LYFT\n\nTSLA\n\nUBER\n\nGOOG\n\n2026 is on the road to being the \"year of autonomous\" driving as Tesla ( TSLA ) and the Alphabet-owned Waymo ( GOOG , GOOGL ) seek to expand their robotaxi services to other major US cities.\nWedbush Securities managing director of equity research Scott Devitt weighs in on the biggest themes and investing plays around self-driving technology, and how he sees 2026 playing out for rideshare companies Uber ( UBER ) and Lyft ( LYFT ).\n\nCatch Scott Devitt's top three consumer internet stock picks heading into 2026.\nAlso watch Yahoo Finance's interview with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign associate professor Katherine Driggs-Campbell about the recent behavior shifts in autonomous vehicles' driving habits\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nSo talk to me a little bit about how you're seeing these themes going into 2026. Robo taxi, AI.\n00:10 Speaker B\nAutonomous is going to be it's going to be the year of autonomous. You know, frankly, particularly in the US with the expansion of Waymo into uh as many as 20 markets in 2026. Our estimate for uh Tesla is that it it enters 30 US markets by the end of 2026 and you're beginning to really see the early stages of a transition from uh human human-driven activity to one that's run by robots. and it's very exciting. It's good for society, it's good for um the health of consumers given that it lowers traffic uh deaths and uh and incidence rates. And so I think autonomous is something that could be a headwind for companies I cover, Lyft and Uber in some ways. Um could be beneficial in other ways and certainly will will be good for Waymo and Tesla. On the AI side, you know, a lot of the the benefits the past two to three years in terms of security prices have come with infrastructure plays. I think you're going to start to see a transition more towards use cases, the enterprise and consumer use cases. And um, you know, these things kind of being found in the wild now and starting to see the ability to quantify uh the returns. Meta's been an early beneficiary of incorporation of AI into the business. I think you'll see more companies as well in 26.\n02:08 Speaker A\nAnd looking at Lyft and Uber, I mean, Uber has done well this year. Uh and I'm curious, is that because of robo taxi uh and and how you see the competition between some of these players uh shaking out? I mean, you've got Waymo that has done so well, and then you've got Tesla that is also making advancements and Tesla which touched all-time highs this year. So I I guess I'm just curious as to how you see it all shaking out within those players.\n02:44 Speaker B\nSo Uber and the performance year to date, it's a little tricky because it did underperform exiting 2024 on fears of autonomous and then recovered this year as it, you know, as autonomous has has been, you know, uh held at bay and hasn't really impacted anyone's business quite yet. And so I I think that that that performance looked over an extended period of time called the next 18 months, Uber's been relatively flat. You know, I think Uber as a company is a bit more insulated than Lyft because it has a delivery business for restaurants as well, which is about half of the gross bookings, and also has a significant business outside the US. In the US, you know, autonomous is ramping quickly and I think it's going only going to accelerate on an S-curve type uh pattern in 2026 and that really exposes Lyft which has over 90% of its gross bookings in the US and and so I think that you're going to start to see the effects of that in the share price which has also done well um this year in 25 could come to an end in 26.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Oscars to air on YouTube: What it means for media industry\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Josh Lipton\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: GOOG\n\nDIS\n\nThe Oscars will be streaming on Alphabet-owned ( GOOG , GOOGL ) YouTube, rather than Disney-owned ( DIS ) ABC, starting in 2029. The shift marks a win for streaming over traditional cable television.\n\"The Ankler\" awards editor Katey Rich explains what the Oscars' move to YouTube means for the media industry.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThe Oscars will stream live for free on YouTube starting in 2029, leaving its longtime home of ABC.\n00:10 Speaker A\nThe deal will run through at least 2033. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reached a deal to broadcast the ceremony, as well as behind the scenes content and red carpet coverage for free on the streaming platform.\n00:23 Speaker A\nThe Oscars are the first major award show to decamp from linear and cable TV for streaming.\n00:30 Speaker A\nFor more, I'm joined now by Katie Rich, the Ankle Awards editor.\n00:35 Speaker A\nKatie, is good to see you. Um, maybe start at a at a high level, Katie, for those of us who don't follow this as closely, you know, the Oscar's moving to YouTube, Katie, why is that such a big deal for Hollywood and and media companies and and media investors? Give us the context.\n00:53 Katie Rich\nWell, Hollywood and digital streaming services and tech in general have a complicated relationship. You know, there's tech companies making their way into Hollywood.\n01:03 Katie Rich\nYouTube has certainly been among them, more on the television side than making anything that you would call films that would be eligible for Oscars. And there's been this growing sense not only that these tech companies are trying to take over more of the industry, but with the ABC, with ABC airing the Oscars, the ratings for it had been going down over the years, just part of the way that audience attention works in no small part thanks to these tech companies.\n01:24 Katie Rich\nSo, ABC had been paying around $100 million to license the Oscars every year, and there has been some reporting that they were looking to spend a little bit less. And then YouTube, constantly trying to maybe prove itself, get a little bit more credibility within Hollywood, I think saw an opportunity and said, okay, we'll be the steward for the Oscars for at least four years.\n01:42 Speaker A\nAnd why, Katie, do you think the Academy chose YouTube? Why that platform? Because reportedly there were there were others, right? Netflix.\n01:49 Katie Rich\nIt's possible that they paid the most, which is certainly no small thing. But there's also the way that the Academy considers itself is kind of a neutral arbiter within Hollywood. You know, it wants to give everyone a fair treatment. It wants all of these studios and streamers and everyone to kind of come to their table, compete for the Oscars, and really just be kind of a home for celebration of good cinema, no matter where it is.\n02:11 Katie Rich\nSo Netflix is obviously a huge player. They're airing the Screen actors Guild Awards, which were recently renamed the Actor Awards, but Netflix also makes movies that compete in the Oscar race.\n02:22 Katie Rich\nSo there's a way that YouTube is sort of a a neutral uh third party that can be in the middle of it. And also in terms of the global reach that they're talking about, Netflix is a global company, of course, but YouTube is just everywhere. It's a link that you can send to anyone you in your life and make sure they can see it. They've emphasized over and over again in announcing this, how they want to expand the audience for the Oscars around the world, and YouTube has that infiltration that basically nobody else does.\n02:45 Speaker A\nAnd for a streamer like YouTube, Katie, how impactful can an event like the Oscars be? I mean, how how impactful can it be for for eyeballs and subscribers and ad dollars?\n02:55 Katie Rich\nI mean, YouTube certainly doesn't lack for eyeballs. They are probably getting more of of people around the world's attention than any studio currently. But in terms of prestige, in terms of saying, you know, we're not just a place where you can look up a video for how to fix your washing machine or watch Mr. Beast, we can be somewhere that stars want to be part of.\n03:09 Katie Rich\nYou know, YouTube has not really made high profile celebrity driven shows the way that say Apple or Netflix or Amazon have. So this is sort of their way of saying, we're not just the every, you know, the everything place, the platform for absolutely anything you want to find, but we're somewhere where you can, you know, celebrate really the great things in culture.\n03:28 Katie Rich\nSo in terms of advertisers, you know, Rolex has partnered with the Academy for years and years. I wonder if that would be an advertiser that would work on YouTube that wouldn't otherwise. You know, the plan doesn't start till 2029, so there's a lot of details left to work out, but I would imagine on YouTube side of thing, the prestige is maybe more of a draw than the eyeballs themselves.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "California tech founders unload on a proposed state wealth tax that already has some billionaires preparing an escape. ‘I am screwed for life’\n\nJason Ma\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nA proposed wealth tax aimed at billionaires hasn&#8217;t yet qualified for California&#8217;s ballot, but it&#8217;s already sparked intense pushback from tech founders in the state.\nIt started when the New York Times reported that venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google cofounder Larry Page were looking into leaving California in case the tax becomes law.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents part of Silicon Valley, flagged the story on X and echoed President Franklin Roosevelt by adding &#8220;I will miss them very much.&#8221;\nThe proposal calls for California residents worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax equivalent to 5% of their assets that can be paid over five years.\nThe wealth tax&#8217;s backers, who want to use the revenue to help offset federal funding cuts for healthcare, must still gather enough signatures before it can get on the ballot in November 2026.\nWhile Khanna is a member of Congress and not a California state lawmaker, his support for the wealth tax unleashed a flood of negative reactions.\nPalmer Luckey, cofounder of defense tech startup Anduril, warned the tax would force founders to sell big pieces of their companies to pay for &#8220;fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.&#8221;\n\nIf he and his wealthy peers can&#8217;t come up with billions of dollars in cash to pay the tax, he said the state could seize his home and garnish his wages.\n&#8220;One market correction, nationalization event, or prohibition of divestiture (not at all uncommon during wartime) and I am screwed for life,&#8221; Luckey posted on X .\nOf particular concern is how the potential wealth tax might treat paper profits from stock gains and stakes in companies that haven&#8217;t gone public, a key form of compensation among startups that have yet to turn profitable.\nFigma cofounder and CEO Dylan Field pointed out that founders and potentially early employees could get caught up in the wealth tax but wouldn&#8217;t be able to use company stock to pay it. Some founders may also have to pay capital gains taxes, meaning they would face a &#8220;double tax event.&#8221;\n\nAnd in the event a startup has an unsuccessful year, founders still on the hook for the wealth tax may be forced to lower their startup&#8217;s valuation via a &#8220;down round&#8221; that would make it harder to draw talent and investors; take out a loan that they may have trouble repaying; or leave California.\n&#8220;Silicon Valley startups (ironically) follow the herd. Once enough respected companies/founders establish a pattern, other startups will follow, even if the wealth tax does not apply to them yet,&#8221; Field posted on X .\n\nStory Continues\nFor his part, Khanna said he opposes capital gains taxes on unrealized income and supports workarounds for founders with illiquid assets and unprofitable companies.\nHe also said tax dollars helped build the AI industry and dismissed the idea that tech entrepreneurs wouldn’t start companies in the state due to a 1% per-year tax, adding that innovators are drawn to the area’s talent.\n\n“We cannot have a nation with extreme concentration of wealth in a few places but where 70 percent of Americans believe the American dream is dead and healthcare, childcare, housing, education is unaffordable,” he said on X . “What will stifle American innovation, what will make us fall behind China, is if we see further political dysfunction and social unrest, if we fail to cultivate the talent in every American and in every city and town.”\nBut Dave Friedberg, cofounder and CEO of Ohalo Genetics, said the wealth tax still amounts to an &#8220;organized government seizure of private property from citizens&#8221; who have already paid other taxes that can total 53% in California.\nHe said the tax flirts with socialism and represents &#8220;a slippery slope that has never gone anywhere good (see economic effects in USSR, Cuba, Venezuela, France and Norway wealth tax etc.)&#8221;\nGarry Tan, CEO of tech startup accelerator Y Combinator, told the New York Post that the wealth tax would drive capital out of the state, hurt innovation, and eventually weaken support for healthcare services.\n“This measure would cause a stampede of unicorns out of California to other states, which would reap the benefits of entrepreneurs, technology and jobs that California enjoys now,” he added.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This Growth Stock Continues to Crush the Market\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Besides powerful network effects, this leading internet enterprise benefits from its dynamic ability to collect and leverage data.\nShares trade at a slight premium to the overall market, a compelling setup for investors.\nThe company has its foot on the gas pedal in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, spending more than $90 billion in capital expenditures this year.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) became a publicly traded company in August 2004. Since that date, it has been one of the best stocks investors could have owned. The share price has climbed 12,240% during that time (as of Dec. 22). The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 844% over that stretch.\nEven after such a monumental gain, this growth stock continues to crush the market, soaring 64% just in 2025. Alphabet is a monster business with a $3.75 trillion market cap. Nonetheless, investors might still want to consider buying shares.\nAlphabet possesses powerful competitive advantages It's not an accident that the company's stock has done so well. This is one of the best businesses on the face of the planet. One of the most important reasons comes down to the economic moat . Alphabet possesses many durable competitive strengths that play to its advantage, giving it a dominant position in the industries it operates in.\n\nNetwork effects are certainly at play. Google Search is constantly getting better, as more queries generate more data that's always refining the algorithm. YouTube is a two-sided ecosystem, with a higher number of viewers and engagement drawing in more content creators, which then improves the user experience. These are positive feedback loops that are hard to stop.\n\"With 15 products that each serve half a billion people, and six that serve over 2 billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in July 2023.\nThere might be no company out there that collects more data than Alphabet. This is a powerful advantage in today's internet economy. Imagine the vast amounts of data that the business can leverage to enhance its various apps. This data also helps train Alphabet's artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nGoogle Cloud benefits both from a cost advantage and from switching costs . Sizable fixed investments are required to scale up the infrastructure needed to serve cloud customers.\nGoogle Cloud was unprofitable for quite some time. However, now it's producing robust profits. And its customers, who have integrated their own workflows with Google Cloud, are discouraged from changing providers unless they want to disrupt their operations and deal with training and onboarding employees to a new system.\n\nStory Continues\nAssume you're a highly motivated, extremely skilled, very resourceful, and well-funded tech entrepreneur. Your mission is to disrupt Alphabet's key segments, including Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. Where do you even begin?\nIt's an almost impossible task that underscores just how dominant this company has become. And for long-term investors, it makes Alphabet a less risky opportunity, since it seems to always be in a position of power.\n\nWhat about the stock's valuation? Successful businesses, especially those with massive market caps like this one, don't fly under the radar. That's why it might come as a surprise that Alphabet's shares aren't expensive today. Investors interested in adding this growth stock to their portfolios are being asked by the market to pay a price-to-earnings ratio of 30.6.\n\nThat's more expensive than the S&P 500. And it's a 23% premium to Alphabet's trailing-five-year average. But the quality of this company is worth the price tag.\nAlphabet is humming along. Revenue in Q3 2025 (ended Sept. 30) increased 16% year over year to $102 billion, with net income rising at a faster rate of 33%.\nThe business has its foot on the gas pedal in the AI race, with forecasted capital expenditures this year of $91 billion to $93 billion, a sizable sum. Alphabet is planning to introduce ads on its Gemini app , which has 650 million monthly active users. This could bring incremental revenue to the mix, giving the company a clear path to monetize all its free AI users.\nSometimes investment opportunities just hit you over the head with how obvious they are. Alphabet is precisely that right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nvidia Stock Had a Volatile 2025: What’s the 2026 Forecast?\n\nMohit Oberoi\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nNvidia stock (NVDA) is up 41.88% year-to-date and is the second-best performing constituent of the “Magnificent 7” stocks, trailing only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), whose 2025 price action surprised even some of the bulls. While Nvidia’s 2025 returns – which are well above twice the average S&P 500 Index ($SPX) constituent – would look stellar, they pale in front of the triple-digit returns that it delivered in the previous two years.\n\nNvidia stock was quite volatile this year and plunged to $86.62 on April 7 amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The rebound was also quick, though, and the stock has more than doubled from its 2025 lows even as it is down 11.37% from the record high of $212.19 in late October.\nMore News from Barchart The Next Market Collapse Will Be Quiet And That Is Exactly Why Investors Will Miss It\nNvidia Stock Is ‘Ripe’ for Gains in 2026, According to This Top Analyst\nThe Saturday Spread: Using Risk Topography to Plan Your Options Strategies (JD, NTAP, ZS)\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\nNvidia Announced Multiple Deals in 2025 Nvidia went on a deal-making spree in 2025, announcing a flurry of investments. Among others, it reported an investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI, $5 billion in Intel (INTC), $10 billion in Anthropic, $1 billion in Nokia (NOK), $2 billion in Synopsis (SNPS), and also participated in funding rounds of several other companies this year. In addition, it committed to invest two billion British pounds in AI startups in the U.K. as well as reportedly investing $2 billion in Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nMore recently, Nvidia struck a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq in a deal that is said to be valued at $20 billion, making it the biggest ever deal for the Jensen Huang-led company. Meanwhile, in an apparent bid to evade regulatory scrutiny, the deal has been structured as an “inference technology licensing agreement,” which would see the Groq founder, president, and other employees join Nvidia.\nUncertainty Over Nvidia’s China Business Another defining feature for Nvidia this year was the continued uncertainty over its China business. The Trump administration barred the company from exporting H20 chips to the Communist country. While later it approved their exports in exchange for a 15% cut in revenues, Nvidia’s China sales all but evaporated after the country cautioned domestic companies against using these chips over potential backdoors.\n\nNow, the U.S. government has allowed exports of the more powerful H200 chips, albeit with an even fatter revenue cut of 25%, and reports suggest that this time around, the demand for these chips is quite strong. However, Democratic lawmakers have called upon the administration to disclose the license applications of Chinese companies looking to buy these chips. The H200 is more powerful than the H20, whose exports were ostensibly blocked over “national security” concerns. So we can be sure of a political slugfest over its exports, given the “civil-military” fusion in the world’s second biggest economy.\n\nStory Continues\nNVDA Stock Forecast Nvidia’s mean target price of $256 is over 34.36% higher than the current price levels. Dan Ives of Wedbush, a permabull on tech stocks, believes that $250 is the base case target for Nvidia by the end of this year, whereas Evercore ISI has the Street-high target price of $352 on the stock, making for a potential 84.75% upside.\nConsensus estimates call for Nvidia’s revenues to rise 63% to $213.2 billion in the current fiscal year, which would end in January 2026, and then rise by almost 50% to $319 billion in the next fiscal year. There could be more upside to these already splendid numbers if Nvidia’s China business gets back on track. Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 42.9x while its P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiple is 0.92, which makes it the only Magnificent 7 constituent to have a PEG multiple below 1.\n\nTo be sure, there are concerns over a potential AI bubble and rising competition in the AI chip market, with even some of Nvidia’s biggest customers like Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN) selling their own chips to third parties.\nOverall, Nvidia appears to have another strong year ahead, and while investors should temper their expectations and not expect triple-digit annual returns in perpetuity, the stock should continue to create investor wealth as it has been doing for the last several years.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: NVDA, INTC, GOOG, AMZN.

      "Content": "'I don't see a bubble': Why Wall Street thinks the stock market can keep climbing even as AI anxiety grows\n\nInes Ferré · Senior Business Reporter\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nAs stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\nAt least for now.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks ( XLK ).\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia ( NVDA ) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq ( GROQ.PVT ).\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google ( GOOG ) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \" One Big Beautiful Bill \" that passed this year and the AI boom.\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile most of the earnings growth this year has been led by the largest seven stocks in the S&P 500, Goldman Sachs analysts also see participation broadening.\n\"We expect macro tailwinds from accelerating economic growth and a fading tariff drag on margins will support an acceleration in the earnings growth rate for the remaining 493 stocks,\" wrote Goldman's Ben Snider earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, AI productivity is expected to lift earnings for companies outside the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks, said Joseph Shaposhnik, founder of Rainwater Equity.\n\"I think some of them will take a break — some of them will perform well,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\"But really, the opportunity for outsized returns next year are going to be outside those seven businesses,\" he added.\nInes Ferre is a Senior Business Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "‘Normies’ lose interest in crypto, but advocates say ‘10-year Bitcoin grind’ will pay off\n\nTim Alper\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 3:14 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nGOOG\n\nPopular interest in Bitcoin and crypto is bottoming out as the year’s end approaches, search engine data indicates.\nThe podcaster and crypto advocate Mario Nawfal wrote on X that there is “close to no retail interest in crypto right now.”\n“None of my normie friends or family ask me anything about crypto anymore,” Nawfal wrote, posting a screenshot of a chart showing a sharp drop in Google searches for the term “crypto.”\n\nThe drop in interest coincides with sluggish Bitcoin price performance and dashed hopes of a “Santa rally” on the markets over Christmas.\n‘Normies’ losing interest Google’s Google Trends data hub records search interest changes on a scale from zero to 100. At the time of writing, global searches for “Bitcoin” stand at just 19, a six-month low, and just a single point above 2025’s low of 18, recorded in mid-June.\nSearches for “crypto” have also crashed from over 50 at the start of the month to just 25 on December 28.\n\nEvidence suggests the trend is not limited to Google. In South Korea, where Naver is the dominant search engine, similar trends have taken root.\nOn a similar 0-100 scale, Naver searches for “Bitcoin” have dropped from a mid-month high of 46 to just 15 on December 28, with “cryptocurrency” experiencing a similar slump.\nOther indicators make equally grim reading, with CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index, a market sentiment measurement tool, locked firmly in the “fear” zone.\nAnother Fear and Greed Index, run by South Korea’s Upbit Data Lab, meanwhile, shows sentiment hovering between the “Fear” and “Neutral” ranges.\nMemecoin hype fades Nawfal said that memecoin losses have taken their toll on retail investors’ confidence.\n“Do we need to start pumping the dino coins again to get retail to come back?” Nawfal mused. “After the Trump/Melania memecoin drama, it seems that retail lost a lot of faith in the space.”\nOfficial Trump, a coin introduced by US President Donald Trump, has seen its market cap slump from a January high of over $9 billion to under $1 billion in late December. Official Melania, the First Lady’s coin, has fared no better.\n\nBut, in an interview with CNBC , Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of the crypto investment provider Bitwise Asset Management, said Bitcoin was likely to bounce back in the long term, and that the first signs of recovery would emerge next year.\n“I think the four-year [Bitcoin price] cycle is being replaced by a 10-year grind,” Hougan said. “I mean, there are big new forces in the world.”\nThese forces, he explained, were the emergence of crypto exchange-traded funds , progressive regulation in the US, and “the growth of stablecoins and tokenisation.”\n\nStory Continues\n“I think those forces are bigger and stronger than the forces that historically caused the four-year cycle ,” Hougan said. “So, specifically, I expect the market to be up next year.”\nHowever, the Bitwise executive warned that meteoric price rises were unlikely in 2026. “It’s not spectacular returns,” he said. “[More like] strong returns, lower volatility, [with] some ups and downs.”\nTim Alper is a news correspondent at DL News.

      "Content": "2 Unstoppable AI Stocks That Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Own\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon is set for a comeback in 2026, helped by its cloud computing segment.\nAlphabet answered a ton of questions about the future of its business in 2025.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAlthough Warren Buffett is on his way out as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , studying his stock picks is a smart move for investors. He's known to be a value investor and only picks stocks that he understands, so when artificial intelligence (AI) companies show up in Berkshire Hathaway'w portfolio, investors would be wise to pay attention.\nTwo AI stocks Berkshire owns that I'm excited about are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Both of these stocks look primed to soar higher in 2026, and I think they make for excellent investments right now.\nBuffett may not have bought these stocks Although Buffett has been the primary money manager at Berkshire Hathaway, there are others who also have management over some funds. Todd Combs (who now works for JPMorgan ) and Ted Weschler ran a portion of the Berkshire portfolio and were known to invest in more tech-centric stocks than Buffett did. So, it's possible that the Amazon and Alphabet purchases were made under their direction.\n\nAlphabet is Berkshire's most recent purchase, and accounts for about 1.7% of its total portfolio. Amazon is a far older holding, and Berkshire has owned shares since 2019, although it only makes up 0.7% of its portfolio. With the size of the positions in Berkshire's investment portfolio, Buffett likely gave them the thumbs up to purchase these shares. So even if they weren't originally his purchase, he has still hung on to them.\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet look like great investments right now, so I'd be surprised if Berkshire were looking to pivot away from them.\nAlphabet and Amazon look primed to soar in 2026 Alphabet has had a great 2025, while Amazon's has been lackluster. Alphabet's stock is up around 60%, while Amazon's is nearly flat, rising only 3%.\nAlphabet's stellar performance comes after many doubted it could be successful in the artificial intelligence realm at the start of the year. There were concerns about Alphabet being broken up for a monopoly, falling behind in generative AI technology, and its cash cow, Google Search, being replaced by generative AI. However, none of those investment theses panned out in 2025, which is why the stock soared.\nThese same points that allowed it to soar in 2025 shoould continue in 2026, allowing Alphabet to continue down its path of dominance next year. With Alphabet leading the way in generative AI after trailing for so long, it opens up new revenue streams that could trickle in.\n\nStory continues\nFurthermore, it's potentially selling its custom AI chip, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), as an alternative to graphics processing units (GPUs) on the open market for the first time. So 2026 could be a monster year for Alphabet, and owning shares like Berkshire is a smart move.\nAmazon's lackluster 2025 isn't on account of its business. Amazon has grown quickly for its size, with revenue rising 13% in the third quarter. The highlight of its sprawling business is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit. AWS is a critical part of Amazon, as it accounts for 66% of operating income despite making up just 18% of revenue.\n\nFurthermore, AWS just posted its fastest growth quarter in multiple years, which should have gotten the market excited about its prospects. However, the market mostly ignored Amazon in 2025, setting it up for success in 2026.\nI think Amazon could easily be the comeback stock of the year in 2026, and its dominance in the cloud computing realm, as well as its content strength in the commerce business, support that prospect. Buffett may be on his way out at Berkshire Hathaway, but his investment picks remain. With Alphabet and Amazon still being fairly large holdings, it's another vote of confidence for these two stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Watch: DebitMyData Human Energy Grid .\nThe Crisis: Billions Spent, Projects Stalled\nSince 2022, the world’s largest AI companies have pledged more than $200 billion to build data centers powering generative intelligence. Yet projects remain paralyzed across multiple jurisdictions — halted by community opposition, regulatory confusion, and growing fears that “AI progress” benefits only corporations, not citizens.\n\nDebitMyData’s solution reframes the equation.\nBy valuing human participation in data exchange, energy contribution, and consent verification, the Human Energy Grid introduces an economic model where infrastructure growth yields tangible local and individual benefits — aligning corporate expansion with community trust.\n“Before the Genesis Order, we already understood the next frontier,” said Preska Thomas,, Founder and CEO of DebitMyData, Inc. “The challenge isn’t building more compute — it’s building more trust.

      "Content": "Have $2,000? 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for at Least a Decade.\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:50 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nSOUN\n\nAMPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's growing AI ecosystem creates compelling growth tailwinds for this quality business.\nSoundHound's voice and conversational AI solutions have caught the attention of major clients.\nAmplitude's AI agents and other tools are building a high-revenue-growth business.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) revolution contains a wealth of investment opportunities, not to mention the potential for massive economic transformation and productivity enhancements. Companies ranging from small start-ups to the world's largest corporate giants are investing heavily in AI research and infrastructure in a bid to keep up in the global technology race.\nThis strong institutional support is expected to accelerate development and adoption and create a favorable and stable environment for AI-focused businesses over the long run. While not all AI stocks will be winners, focusing on quality companies with robust competitive advantages and strong financial foundations can allow you to capitalize on the future of this industry in its still relatively nascent stages.\nOn that note, if you have $2,000 to invest, here are three AI stocks to buy and hold for at least a decade.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) full-stack AI ecosystem, vast data moat, dominant market positions in search and cloud, and substantial financial strength continue to pose enviable tailwinds for this behemoth business. Alphabet boasts end-to-end AI infrastructure, including its in-house AI chips (Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs), the Gemini foundational models, the Google Cloud platform, and a massive array of user-facing products, including Search, YouTube, and Android.\n\nTPUs are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed specifically for neural network math, which makes them efficient for AI training and inference, unlike more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Not only are TPUs the backbone of Google's AI, running core products like Google Search and training massive models like Gemini, but they also provide notable cost savings and boost internal performance.\nBy developing its own silicon, Alphabet is able to decouple from external chip supply chains and pricing to achieve greater control and scale for AI development. Google Cloud now offers TPUs as a service, which also positions Alphabet as a major force in the lucrative AI hardware market beyond just being a consumer of chips.\n\nUser interaction data from Search and YouTube is used to train and refine AI models, providing another durable competitive advantage for the broader business ecosystem. Importantly, AI is boosting Google Search traffic and optimizing ad placements. Search is the company's core cash engine and still represents more than half of the company's overall revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle is the default search engine on most devices, which gives Alphabet a vast distribution network to deploy and refine new AI features. Other ventures, like Waymo (autonomous driving) and AI-powered healthcare research through its subsidiary Verily, are more nascent sources of long-term growth potential and demonstrate Alphabet's commitment to AI innovation.\n\nAlphabet remains consistently profitable (net income increased 33% in the third quarter alone) and generates significant cash flow, which it habitually invests in AI infrastructure, data centers, and research. The company remains a compelling and stalwart play in the AI space that long-term investors can buy, hold, and add to for years to come.\n2. SoundHound SoundHound (NASDAQ: SOUN) specializes in developing and providing independent voice and conversational artificial intelligence solutions for businesses across various industries. This enables companies to integrate customized, natural-sounding voice assistants into their products, services, and apps. Instead of a two-step process of transcribing speech to text and then processing it, SoundHound's technology understands both speech and intent in one step, allowing for faster and more accurate responses.\n\nThese solutions are used in multiple sectors. SoundHound has moved beyond its initial focus on the automotive sector (e.g., its partnership with Stellantis ) into areas such as restaurants (e.g., Chipotle Mexican Grill , Five Guys, White Castle, Jersey Mike's) to reduce its dependency on any single customer. For example, restaurants utilize SoundHound's platform to automate phone and drive-thru orders, manage complex menu modifications, and address customer inquiries about business hours.\nSoundHound also provides AI agents for customer service in various industries, including healthcare, financial services, and insurance. The company generates revenue through subscription fees for its software solutions, commissions from voice-enabled commerce interactions, and by licensing its technology to partners.\n\nSoundHound's Q3 2025 revenue of $42 million represented a 68% increase from a year ago. However, SoundHound has never posted an annual profit, continues to report substantial GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net losses, and its core operations are still bleeding cash. That's why the stock has been hit so hard of late.\nStill, SoundHound's collaborations with major brands and the acquisition of companies like Amelia (an enterprise agentic AI platform) and Interactions (a customer service AI platform) have strengthened its market position, expanded its customer base, and added new capabilities that could prove to be generous growth tailwinds. SoundHound reported a significant contractual backlog of approximately $1.2 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAnd unlike big tech competitors ( Amazon , Google, and Apple ) whose voice AI solutions are tied to their ecosystems, SoundHound offers white-label, customizable solutions that allow businesses to maintain full brand control and data privacy and provide a key selling point for these enterprises. If you believe in that value proposition and have the risk tolerance to invest in a more pure-play, AI-driven business, SoundHound could be worth considering for at least a small position over the next decade.\n3. Amplitude Amplitude (NASDAQ: AMPL) is a digital analytics platform that helps businesses understand how customers use their digital products to improve user experiences and drive revenue growth. The company has fully embraced AI by launching a suite of AI agents and features that automate data analysis and generate actionable insights for customers.\n\nAmplitude's AI agents are autonomous AI tools that monitor user behavior, detect issues (like falling conversion rates), form hypotheses, and suggest or even implement optimizations for things like checkout flow or feature adoption. Its AI feedback solution is an AI-native tool that synthesizes customer feedback from various sources (e.g., calls, reviews, tickets) to instantly develop themes, connect them to user behavior, and help companies build better features.\nAfter some post-pandemic headwinds, Amplitude's growth has started to accelerate again, with recent quarters showing solid increases in revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR). Amplitude reported excellent Q3 2025 results, with ARR of $347 million, up 16% year over year, and remaining performance obligations (RPO) of $391.9 million, up 37% year over year.\n\nAmplitude's business model is a freemium tiered software-as-a-service framework centered on product analytics. It employs a land-and-expand strategy, where it acquires customers through a robust free tier and scales revenue as they grow and adopt more advanced platform capabilities. Companies across various industries, including prominent names such as Walmart , Atlassian , and Shopify, as well as growth-stage disruptors like DoorDash and Coinbase , utilize Amplitude to gain insights into their users' behavior and enhance their digital products.\nThe company has a diverse base of over 4,500 customers and a growing number of large enterprise customers. Its cohort of customers with $100,000 or more in ARR rose 15% year over year in Q3. Overall revenue grew 18% year over year in Q3 2025.\n\nWhile still posting a GAAP net loss, Amplitude is cash-flow positive and expects to achieve non-GAAP operating income for the full year 2025. It generated free cash flow of $3.4 million in Q3. If the company's AI platform continues to gain headway, this business could have a significant role to play in the evolving AI revolution. That's a value proposition that some long-term investors might want to capitalize on.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nMSFT\n\nTSM\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is a leader in e-commerce and fintech.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are making waves with their respective AI innovations.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the top chip manufacturer in the world.\n10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre ›\nInvesting for the long term requires a disciplined and resilient mindset to navigate the inherent volatility of the stock market. Managing the psychology behind your investment decisions is as crucial as selecting the right investments.\n\nThe market price of a stock is often driven by short-term emotions and news, while its true value is tied to the underlying company's long-term earning power and assets. A strong mindset allows you to view temporary price drops as potential buying opportunities for quality assets, not reasons to panic.\nLikewise, if you're focused on the long-term picture, you can select quality businesses with robust fundamentals that make sense as part of your portfolio without being swayed by short-term market volatility. If you have cash to invest in the stock market right now, here are four stocks to consider buying and holding for at least five years.\n1. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the clear e-commerce leader across over a dozen countries in Latin America, including major markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. It has a significant competitive advantage over global players like Amazon due to its established presence, brand recognition, and deep understanding of local market needs.\n\nThe company operates a vast tech ecosystem, including its e-commerce marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, which is powered by its integrated fintech arm Mercado Pago, its robust logistics business Mercado Envíos, and advertising services. It's worth noting that Mercado Pago has grown into a full digital financial services platform (e.g., payments, credit, savings, investments) that serves the region's large unbanked population and has created a sticky user base with high monetization potential.\nThe company is consistently profitable and boasts impressive growth metrics. In Q3 2025, it reported a 39% year-over-year revenue increase. Total net revenue reached $7.4 billion. Total payment volume reached $71 billion, up 41% year over year, and gross merchandise volume rose to $16.5 billion, a 28% year-over-year spike.\n\nRobust e-commerce performance in core markets like Brazil and Mexico bolstered MercadoLibre's quarterly performance. And, the number of successful items sold grew by 39% year over year to 635 million. If you want to invest in an e-commerce and fintech giant operating outside the U.S., MercadoLibre is a profitable and compelling leader to consider.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) managed to effectively monetize generative AI faster than most peers by integrating it across its entire tech stack. AI services accounted for roughly 15 percentage points of the total Azure revenue growth in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026. Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, which has created a high-margin recurring revenue stream.\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI capacity, and its capital expenditures have exceeded $30 billion per quarter to meet surging demand. Azure remains a primary catalyst for the business's long-term value and consistently delivers high growth even on a massive revenue base. For the full fiscal year 2025, Microsoft's annual revenue surpassed $281 billion, growing by 15% from the prior year. Azure revenue was more than $75 billion, a 34% increase year over year. Azure holds approximately 20% of the global cloud market.\nMicrosoft maintains one of the strongest balance sheets in the corporate world, which supports its consistent returns to investors. It's one of only two U.S. companies with a perfect AAA credit rating (that's higher than the U.S. government). The company generated over $100 billion in net income in fiscal 2025, so it continues to have massive flexibility for R&D and acquisitions.\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years and regularly repurchases billions in stock (it returned almost $11 billion to shareholders in the most recent quarter alone through dividends and share repurchases). Management and analysts have set ambitious targets for the next five years. CEO Satya Nadella aims to exceed $500 billion in annual revenue by 2030, nearly double its current scale.\n3. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is deeply integrating powerful AI models like Gemini across its massive ecosystem (e.g, Search, YouTube, Cloud). AI improves its search relevance, makes YouTube more engaging, and personalizes user experiences, which in turn can drive better engagement and more ad dollars. Instead of cannibalizing search, Alphabet's new tools like AI summaries are increasing ad impressions and conversions, and expanding its commercial pathways in search.\n\nAlphabet is also leveraging its custom TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) semiconductor chips to compete in cloud infrastructure. While historically the company had reserved most TPUs for in-house use and cloud services, it has recently begun selling some directly to third parties in specific bilateral deals. These include major AI clients like Anthropic as Alphabet creates a new high-margin revenue stream.\nAlphabet's TPUs are revolutionary, particularly because they are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) purpose-built for the core mathematical operations of deep learning applications. This specialized design provides significant advantages in performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness at scale compared to the more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Revenue from TPUs is a key driver of the overall Google Cloud segment's growth, which generated robust Q3 2025 revenue of $15.2 billion, a 34% year-over-year increase.\n\nAnalysts from firms like Morgan Stanley project that expanded external sales could add billions in new revenue to Alphabet's top line in the coming years (an estimated $13 billion for every 500,000 units sold by 2027). AI could also unlock opportunities in robotics (Waymo), healthcare, and enterprise solutions outside of Alphabet's traditional advertising and cloud businesses. Alphabet's strong balance sheet with substantial cash and low debt, and a generous history of providing enviable returns to shareholders, are icing on the cake for long-term investors in this storied business.\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) or TSMC is the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing and controls roughly 70% of the global foundry market. Unlike investing in a single chip designer, holding TSMC can allow investors to profit regardless of who wins the AI race. And the reality is that there will likely be many winners as the AI revolution heats up.\n\nThe demand for AI computing power is soaring, and only a few companies possess the capabilities to design the required chips. All major AI players -- including Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom -- rely on TSMC to build their most advanced chips. The company produces at least 90% of the world's most advanced chips, which has created a massive technological moat that competitors like Intel and Samsung are currently struggling to bridge.\nManagement expects AI-related revenue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. TSMC had a very strong Q3 2025 financially and beat expectations with both record profits and revenue. Substantial and growing demand for AI chips and high-performance computing (HPC) drove revenue up over 30% year over year. Net income surged 40% year over year, and TSMC's gross margin improved to 59.5%.\n\nTSMC is aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of Taiwan. The company has committed $165 billion to build six advanced fabs in Arizona, with the first already being in volume production. Additional major investments are underway in Japan and Germany, and management aims to have 30% of its most advanced capacity located outside Taiwan by 2028. Shares are up about 40% year to date, and it may be wise to scoop some up before the business soars higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?

Here's What's Next.\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia was the first $5 trillion stock, but it's declined over the past few weeks.\nThe chipmaker has an edge in its vertically integrated ecosystem of products.\nHowever, it's facing new competition from the likes of Amazon and Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made stock market history, again, when it reached a $5 trillion market value at the end of October. However, it has since fallen almost 10% from those highs and currently sports a $4.4 trillion value. What's next for the artificial intelligence (AI) giant?\nCompetition and new products One way Nvidia has stayed on top of the AI mountain is by constantly upping its game and releasing new, groundbreaking products. It's best known for its expensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), but it's increasingly focused on vertically integrated products that draw high-paying clients into its ecosystem.\n\nThese companies are spending vast amounts of money on their AI development using Nvidia products, creating high barriers to entry for other vendors. That gives Nvidia an edge on top of the one it already has from having the most powerful program.\nHowever, there are other top companies, including Amazon and Alphabet , that are creating their own AI chips and finding the white space to drive AI.\nWhat seems likely is that Nvidia will keep launching new and improved technology and keep its lead, but as competition heats up, the landscape continues to change, and the company gets bigger, growth will decelerate. The price is already coming down to a more realistic valuation , and it could still beat the market next year, but it isn't likely to deliver the life-changing gains it has in the past.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Peter Thiel and Larry Page are preparing to flee California in case the state passes a billionaire wealth tax, report says\n\nJason Ma\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 12:38 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTech billionaires are making plans to bail on California ahead a possible ballot measure that would tax their assets to help pay for healthcare.\nSources told the New York Times that venture capitalist Peter Thiel has explored spending more time outside California and opening an office for his Los Angeles-based personal investment firm, Thiel Capital, in another state.\n\nMeanwhile, Google cofounder Larry Page has discussed leaving the state by year&#8217;s end, sources told the Times , while three limited liability companies associated with him have filed documents to incorporate in Florida.\nThe Thiel Foundation and Google parent Alphabet didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Thiel and Page did not respond to the Times .\nTech investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned on the risk of a wealth tax in California, saying it will eventually bankrupt the state.\n&#8220;The inevitable outcome will be an exodus of the state’s most talented entrepreneurs who can and will choose to build their companies in less regressive states,&#8221; he posted on X on Monday. &#8220;All that will be left behind is the middle class. The tax burden, then, will fall to the middle class because after the &#8216;richest&#8217; choose to leave, the middle class are both (a) the only ones left and (b) are the largest source of state income to extract taxes from.&#8221;\n\nOn Friday, he posted in a reply to Sen. Ted Cruz , who urged him to move to Texas, that it&#8217;s &#8220;under serious consideration.&#8221;\nBackers of the potential wealth tax must still gather enough signatures before it can qualify for the ballot in November 2026.\nThe proposal calls for California residents worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax equivalent to 5% of their assets. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Page is worth $270 billion and Thiel is worth $27.2 billion.\nThe healthcare union pushing the measure, the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, estimated the wealth tax could raise $100 billion in revenue and offset federal cuts.\nBut California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is also considered a top presidential hopeful, has come out against it.\n\nCompanies have already been leaving California for places with lower taxes and less red tape. Elon Musk moved Tesla and SpaceX to Texas.\nAnd while leading AI companies are based in California, new data centers and AI infrastructure are being built outside the state, where land, water and electricity are more available.\nNew Yorkers aired similar worries about an exodus after democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected the city&#8217;s mayor last month. But so far, that has yet to materialized as luxury home sales in Manhattan surged in November.\n\nStory Continues\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents part of Silicon Valley, said tax dollars helped build the AI industry and dismissed the idea that tech entrepreneurs wouldn&#8217;t start companies in the state due to a 1% tax, adding that innovators are drawn to the area&#8217;s talent.\n&#8220;We cannot have a nation with extreme concentration of wealth in a few places but where 70 percent of Americans believe the American dream is dead and healthcare, childcare, housing, education is unaffordable,&#8221; he said on X . &#8220;What will stifle American innovation, what will make us fall behind China, is if we see further political dysfunction and social unrest, if we fail to cultivate the talent in every American and in every city and town.&#8221;\nStill, he acknowledged lack of accountability and fraud concerns over state tax dollars, saying Sacramento needs anti-corruption measures.\nBlake Scholl, founder and CEO Boom Supersonic, pointed to the billions spent by California for a high-speed rail project that&#8217;s over-budget and behind schedule.\n&#8220;This is morally wrong and ends poorly for everyone,&#8221; he said about the wealth tax in response to Khanna on X.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Alphabet Crushed Mag 7 Stocks This Year — Only To Be Crushed By These 8 Country ETFs\n\nPiero Cingari\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 11:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is on pace to top the 2025 Magnificent Seven leaderboard, but investors who looked beyond U.S. tech found even richer returns across eight different global equity markets.\nShares of Google's parent company are up 66% year-to-date, the best performance among the seven mega-cap tech giants. That rally easily tops Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which is up 42%.\n\nYet the real surprise sits overseas.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nAcross emerging and developed markets alike, eight country exchange-traded funds tracking stocks from around the globe have outpaced Google's parent, offering a vivid reminder that the world's investment story this year is not solely written in Big Tech.\nAccording to data from CountryETFtracker, eight country-focused ETFs have delivered stronger year-to-date returns than Alphabet:\n8. iShares MSCI South Africa ETF (NYSE: EZA ), up 67.3%\n\n7. iShares MSCI Austria ETF (NYSE: EWO ), up 67.9%\n6. Global X – MSCI Colombia ETF (NYSE: COLO ), up 68.5%\n5. iShares MSCI Poland ETF (NYSE: EPOL ), up 68.6%\n4. iShares MSCI Spain ETF (NYSE: EWP ), up 73%\n3. Global X – MSCI Greece ETF (NYSE: GREK ), up 77%\n2 . iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF (NYSE: EPU ), up 85%\n1 . iShares MSCI South Korea ETF (NYSE: EWY ), up 87%\nPhoto: CountryETFtracker.com\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nCommodities Rewrite The Script In Emerging Markets At least three of the strongest performers share a common driver: commodities.\nSouth Africa, Colombia and Peru rode a powerful surge in precious and industrial metals.\nSilver has surged 160% year-to-date, while gold has climbed nearly 70%. Even lesser-known metals like platinum and palladium posted gains of 170% and 110%, respectively.\n\nFor stocks tied to these markets, it has been a windfall of gains.\nIn South Africa, miners dominated the tape. AngloGold Ashanti Plc (NYSE: AU ) and Gold Fields Limited Sponsored ADR (NYSE: GFI ), both top holdings in EZA, have each surged more than 220%.\nCurrency strength added fuel. The South African rand is up more than 11% against the dollar, on track for its best year since 2009.\nPeru followed a similar script. Six mining companies rank among the top 10 holdings in EPU. Each has posted triple-digit gains so far this year, lifting the entire market higher.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Peruvian sol gained over 10% against the dollar, on track for its best-performing year since Peru’s Central Bank issued the new currency in 1997.\nFor markets long viewed as cyclical or volatile, commodities turned into a powerful tailwind — and investors willing to look beyond the U.S. were rewarded.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

Countries like Spain and Greece — and even Italy, up 51% year-to-date — have benefited from a sharp rebound in their banking sectors after decades of underperformance.\nIn Greece, shares of National Bank of Greece , Eurobank and Alpha Bank — the three largest holdings of the GREK ETF — are up 85%, 68%, and 133% respectively in 2025.\n\nSpain tells a similar story.\nBanco Santander S.A. (NYSE: SAN ), which carries roughly an 18% weight in the EWP ETF, has climbed an eye-catching 129% year-to-date.\nHigher interest margins, improved balance sheets and renewed investor confidence combined to lift sectors many had written off for years.\nHow Did South Korea Take The Crown? South Korea's rally came straight from technology.\nChipmakers tied to artificial intelligence drove nearly all the upside.\nSamsung Electronics Co. Ltd (OTC: SSNLF ) and SK Hynix together account for about 40% of EWY's portfolio. Their shares have jumped 123% and 250% year-to-date, respectively.\nThe move mirrors global demand for memory chips and AI infrastructure, but with far more leverage than U.S. megacaps.\n\nThe takeaway for investors fixated on a narrow group of American tech stocks is clear.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d558a4b2-0c74-3ba9-9b62-bfd66341ea62/the-best-stocks-to-invest.html",
      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 10:50 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nLLY\n\nABBV\n\nKey Points Amazon and Alphabet are key leaders in the AI race on top of their flagship businesses.\nWalmart benefits from consistent non-discretionary spending like groceries.\nEli Lilly and AbbVie are major pharmaceutical players that have impressive portfolios.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAttempting to time the market by identifying the exact bottom of a dip is very difficult, even for experienced investors. What appears to be a dip can turn into a prolonged decline or a falling knife, and you could just as easily miss out on the best market days to invest as you could the worst.\n\nInstead, by focusing your attention on making quality investments and additions to your portfolio in all market environments, you can withstand the highs and lows of market whims while enriching your portfolio over time.\nIf you have $50,000 to invest right now, you could choose to diversify that capital across a handful of different businesses. Here are five names that you might want to include on that list.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for its leading cloud infrastructure business and flagship e-commerce platform, but also boasts an ever-expanding presence across various sectors, including digital entertainment, groceries, advertising, and autonomous vehicles. Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) isn't just the most profitable segment for the company -- it's also the dominant player in the competitive cloud computing market and controls about 30% of this lucrative space.\n\nThe company remains the leading online retailer in the United States, with a market share of around 40%. Amazon is heavily investing in AI across its operations, from logistics optimization to developing custom AI chips like Trainium and Inferentia to offer clients a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs . These innovations are designed to improve efficiency and attract new customers to AWS.\nOpenAI has signed a landmark, multi-year deal to use AWS's infrastructure for running its AI workloads, including the training of future models. Until recently, Microsoft was OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider. The deal is a significant win for Amazon, as it reassures investors that AWS can compete effectively with other dominant players in providing AI infrastructure.\n\nThe deal involves a massive commitment of computing resources, and Amazon plans to build dedicated data center capacity for OpenAI. It's also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion or more in OpenAI. The investment would likely involve OpenAI using Amazon's custom-designed AI chips for some workloads to compete with Nvidia's dominant chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon remains extremely financially sound thanks to its strong balance sheet, consistent profitability, and expanding margins. Despite its status as a growth stock, the stock looks reasonably valued at approximately 27 times forward earnings.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has integrated AI seamlessly into its core products and created new tailwinds of growth for the business that long-term investors can capitalize on. The Gemini app alone has over 650 million monthly active users. There have been rumors that the company plans to monetize this user base through various forms of advertising, an area where Alphabet has long remained an indomitable leader.\n\nHowever, Google's Vice President of Global Ads, Daniel Taylor, and the official Google Ad Liaison account have publicly stated otherwise, so that remains unlikely, at least for now. The company is still actively monetizing AI in other areas, including AI Overviews in Google Search, and testing ads in AI Mode within Search. Meanwhile, the core Google Search business, along with YouTube, continues to drive profitable growth for the Alphabet ecosystem.\nGoogle Search & Other revenue reached $56.57 billion in Q3, a 15% year-over-year increase. YouTube advertising revenue surpassed the $10 billion mark for the first time in the third quarter (a 15% increase year over year). The Google Services segment, which includes Search and YouTube, also reported operating income of $33.53 billion (up about 9% from a year ago), despite absorbing a $3.5 billion European Commission fine during the quarter. And, consolidated revenue for Alphabet rose 16% to $102.35 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3 2025, and this segment's operating income increased by an eye-popping 85% in the same quarter. Alphabet's backlog of future cloud deals increased 79% in Q3. Alphabet also has potential future growth engines beyond its core businesses, including Waymo and advancements in quantum computing.\nDespite the stock's strong performance in 2025 (up over 60%), it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 30. Alphabet also retains approximately $98.5 billion in cash against $22 billion in long-term debt. This stock continues to look like a no-brainer buy.\n3. Walmart Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) is the world's largest retailer by sales. Its massive scale allows it to offer lower prices and negotiate better terms with suppliers, a significant advantage that helps it attract cost-conscious shoppers, including in inflationary periods.\nWalmart has effectively integrated its vast network of thousands of stores into its e-commerce operations and uses them as fulfillment hubs to offer fast delivery and easy in-store pickup options. This strategy has driven robust e-commerce growth (e-commerce sales were up 27% globally in Q3 FY26).\n\nThe company continues to expand into higher-margin areas like advertising and its membership program, which are contributing a meaningful share of operating income and bolstering overall profitability. Walmart also continues to invest in technology, automation, and AI-driven systems to improve its supply chain efficiency, inventory management, and customer experience, which could position it for long-term success against major retail competitors.\nIn Walmart's Q3, the company generated total revenue of $179.5 billion, up about 6% year over year. Its global advertising business clocked growth of 53%, bolstered by the integration of VIZIO and strong performance from Walmart Connect, while membership income increased 16.7% thanks to double-digit growth in Walmart+ and Sam's Club China memberships.\n\nHouseholds earning more than $100,000 accounted for 75% of Walmart's market share gains during the quarter. Approximately 35% of store-fulfilled orders in the U.S. were delivered in under three hours, with expedited delivery sales growing nearly 70%.\nWalmart is also a Dividend King, having raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years. This history of reliable payouts could appeal to income-focused, long-term investors and underscores its cash flow durability. Its current yield is in the ballpark of 0.8%, a bit below the average S&P 500 stock. While Walmart's trading higher than historical averages (about 38 times forward earnings), this stalwart consumer staples stock could be a smart addition to a long-term investor's portfolio.\n\n4. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) leads the market for GLP-1 medications and has officially surpassed its rival Novo Nordisk . The market for these drugs is projected to reach over $100 billion by 2030, so there's a considerable long-term growth opportunity for the company to continue to capitalize on.\nIts dual-acting drugs, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss), have shown superior efficacy compared to competitors in clinical trials, which has fueled a significant increase in Eli Lilly's market share.\n\nThe company has promising late-stage candidates, including the once-daily oral weight-loss pill orforglipron and the triple-agonist injectable retatrutide, which could further expand its market reach and offer more treatment options to patients. Eli Lilly has filed for FDA approval for orforglipron. It's a small molecule, easier to manufacture than peptides, and shows promise for diabetes as well as cardiovascular risk factors.\nRetatrutide replicates the effects of three different natural hormones: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon. By combining the effects of all three hormones, retatrutide is designed to be a highly effective treatment for conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could serve as a future pillar of Eli Lilly's portfolio.\n\nEli Lilly has consistently beaten analyst expectations, with its third-quarter 2025 revenue soaring 54% year over year to $17.6 billion. The company has invested billions in expanding its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and internationally to meet the explosive demand for its drugs.\nDespite the stock's high P/E ratio of around 34 on a forward basis, the company's strong growth prospects and dominant position in a revolutionary therapeutic area could warrant a long-term investment in this powerhouse healthcare stock. The company has also paid a dividend in some form since the 1800s, and regularly increases its payout. It's increased its dividend by a notable 15% for seven years in a row and counting.\n5. AbbVie AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) is benefiting from the burgeoning sales of its flagship immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which delivered combined revenues of about $7 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. These drugs are more than making up for the decline in sales of Humira, which was once the top-selling drug in the world, and have patent protection into the 2030s.\n\nThe drugmaker's overall net revenue for the three-month period totaled just shy of $16 billion, up 9% year over year. AbbVie has around 90 programs in its R&D pipeline across various therapeutic areas. Recent acquisitions have added promising new candidates to the mix.\nThese include candidates like Bretisilocin (from Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals) and ISB 2001 (from Ichnos Glenmark Innovation), and signal AbbVie's push into novel neuroscience and oncology, including psychedelic-inspired therapies and advnced antibody-based cancer drugs. Bretisilocin is a serotonin receptor agonist designed for major depressive disorder (MDD), while ISB 2001 is a T-cell engager for multiple myeloma.\nThe company has increased its dividend for 54 consecutive years (including its time as part of Abbott Laboratories ), which makes it another Dividend King on today's list. The current forward dividend yield is an attractive 3.05%.\n\nAbbVie stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 16. If you're looking for a quality healthcare stock to buy and hold for the long run, definitely don't overlook AbbVie the next time you go stock shopping.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?
