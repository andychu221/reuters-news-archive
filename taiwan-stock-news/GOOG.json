TAE's backers include tech giant Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Goldman Sachs ( GS ), and oil major Chevron ( CVX ).\n\nThe agreement, valued at more than $6 billion, is a bet on the future of fusion, a type of nuclear technology that mimics the way the sun produces light and heat. Fusion is carbon-free and produces significantly less radioactive waste than traditional nuclear power.\nThe technology is not yet commercially available, but the deal includes an immediate $200 million in cash at signing. The combined company is expected to start of construction of its first utility-scale fusion power plant in 2026.\nUnder the terms of the deal, TMTG and TAE shareholders will each own approximately 50% of the newly combined entity.\nUpon closing, TMTG, currently majority owned by President Trump's revocable trust, will serve as the holding company for Truth Social and TAE, among other entities.",

      "Content": "ChatGPT’s mobile app hits new milestone of $3B in consumer spending\n\nSarah Perez\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:50 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: XAAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nChatGPT has hit a new milestone of $3 billion in worldwide consumer spending on mobile as of this week, according to estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures . This figure represents the total spending on iOS and Android devices since the app’s launch in May 2023, when it first arrived, then only on iOS.\nWhat’s notable is that the bulk of that spending took place this year. Worldwide, consumers spent an estimated $2.48 billion in the ChatGPT mobile app in 2025, representing a 408% year-over-year increase from the $487 million spent in 2024. In 2023, the app’s first year of availability, it earned $42.9 million, before growing 1,036% to reach the 2024 figure.\nThese numbers represent a sharp rise in consumer adoption, compared with other popular apps. For instance, it took ChatGPT 31 months to reach $3 billion in consumer spending, but the top earner, TikTok, took 58 months to do so, Appfigures told TechCrunch.\nChatGPT also reached the milestone faster than top streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max, which hit the $3 billion figure in 42 months and 46 months, respectively.\nxAI’s Grok, however, is seeing a similar revenue trajectory to ChatGPT, compared with other AI rivals.\nGrok was released in late 2023 to X Premium Plus subscribers before becoming more broadly available last year. But if you compare the pace of consumer spending across AI apps, Grok came the closest to matching ChatGPT’s cumulative revenue at the same point, once it began monetizing. (You can see this on the chart below, which plots the AI apps’ spending aligned to when each app began monetizing.)\nWhile the $3 billion in spending represents a significant uptake by consumers, it’s not the only way to measure AI app adoption or potential long-term revenue.\nChatGPT’s mobile customers are buying paid subscriptions, like the $20 per month ChatGPT Plus or the $200 per month ChatGPT Pro for advanced users. But AI apps can generate revenue in other ways, including through developer offerings and, perhaps soon for ChatGPT , ads. In addition, ChatGPT on Wednesday launched its own app store of sorts, which the company suggests will be monetized in some way in the future, its blog post noted .\nGoogle, meanwhile, is exploring the potential to transition its healthy search ads business to AI-powered search, placing ads in AI Mode , AI Overviews , AI shopping , and an increasingly AI-powered Discover page , among other things.\nAnthropic is aiming at the business market and is reportedly on track for $70 billion in revenue by 2028.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

( HUT ) unveiled its own partnership with Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Fluidstack to build an AI data center in Louisiana. Alphabet's Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) is providing the backstop on this latter deal.\nHut 8 CEO Asher Genoot joins Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to further discuss the logistics behind constructing the data center, designing the systems inside the facility, and Google's credit history that ultimately enabled this deal.\nAlso watch Asher Genoot explain some of the details of the data center deal and Google's invaluable role in securing it.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nI'm sure you've seen these stories recently, Azure of the difficulty building AI infrastructure, building out these data centers. You know, Core Weve stock has gotten absolutely hammered the past six weeks because of delays in building out their sites. What, how hard is it to bring these sites to life and what challenges do you anticipate over the next year?\n00:23 Speaker B\nSo there's two things there. One is expectation management. We actually have told the customer we're going to deliver the data center, start delivering the first data hall in Q2 of 2027. That gives us ample runway and a conservative delivery schedule to make sure that we're able to push to deliver on time, rather than be crunched on a schedule that's really tight already. And second, it's all about do you have the local labor? Do you have the general contracting? Because there are so many of these data centers being built, are there the people to actually build and manage these?\n01:00 Speaker B\nSo with Jacob's Engineering as a design and engineering firm, we have an engineering group and we have a construction group. Then local contractors like MMR, Cajun, Turner, these are all local contractors on electrical, civil, mechanical in the state of Louisiana that have already committed to our facility and the manpower required to build this site. Then what goes into the data center? It's the actual supply chain. Verve is our partner on from a supply chain perspective, delivering long lead time items.\n01:40 Speaker B\nMany of those we're actually going to skid so we can actually do a lot of the manufacturing and the uh assembly offsite. And so when we bring it on site, it's a faster execution and deployment as well. So I think giving customers more conservative schedules, meanwhile bringing together a group of partners that have already committed to those expectations is critical. And that's why it took us a little bit longer to announce this deal because if we just announced a customer deal, that would have been great, we would have to figure out how to actually deliver after signing the contract.\n02:19 Speaker B\nHere, we signed all of these commitments at the same time and so we're not only delivering a commitment to the customer, but we have commitments from all of our partners that they are going to deliver on that same commitment.\n02:35 Speaker A\nSo the market rewarding Hut 8, uh also a couple of your competitors, but on the other side of the spectrum, you have the market worried about a company like Oracle and Blue Owl Capital and perhaps Oracle having too much debt and Blue Owl Capital not supporting their initiatives. Is the market right to have those debt fears?\n03:04 Speaker B\nThere's a lot of dollars being deployed into infrastructure today. And at the end of the day, these are long-term commitments. For us, we had multiple customers that we were negotiating, dealing with and working with, and credit is so important. Is this a customer that in all scenarios, AI strong, AI weaker, but in all scenarios will pay on their lease obligations. And that's why having this Google backstop and this financial backstop on all lease payments, roughly about $7 billion throughout the course of this project.\n03:45 Speaker B\non all minimum power bills, about a billion dollars on other pass through expenses like insurance, operations, taxes and so forth. Having that commitment is critical because Google, in our opinion, is one of the most creditworthy companies in the world. They have a strong core business through their search engine that is able to generate one of the best cash flows as a company in the whole world. Then they have Gemini, they have their own TPUs in terms of manufacturing their own chips.\n04:23 Speaker B\nThey own YouTube, they own Android, they own Waymo for car uh collection. I think the next frontier of AI training is not just text training of the web, but on video recognition as well. So if you think about the all the footage that they pick up in those Waymo cars, all the video uh footage that they have in uh in on YouTube, we are massive believers not to even mention Quantum which they're leading in as well. And so we're big believers that Google has strong cash flows, one of the best in the world and that they also have a diversified business stream and is able to continue to grow and become a stronger and stronger business and partnering with them having their financial back stop and guarantee behind this project.\n05:14 Speaker B\nI think has given us, our lenders, our partners all a ton of confidence in the value of this specific deal.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company\n\nSamantha Dorisca\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nDarrell Spencer is shattering various glass ceilings.\nThe Chicago native credits his hustling nature to his parents. His mother works as a postmaster for the United States Postal Service. His father worked for the Chicago Police Department and rose through the ranks to become a commander before retiring. His father also has a real estate portfolio, which was an additional stream of revenue for the family and was an early sign for Spencer that there are other financial paths to follow outside the confines of corporate America.\n\nWorking In Big Tech After completing a bachelor’s in economics at Connecticut College on a full-tuition national scholarship, Spencer got a job in finance but later pivoted into big tech. He has worked at Facebook, Google, Pinterest, and LinkedIn within their customer sales department in advertising, he told AFROTECH. Still, he felt called to entrepreneurship.\n“I helped them generate millions of dollars in revenue through a strategy across each different platform at each company that I was at,” he shared. “Did really well there. However, I just didn’t feel fulfilled. I woke up every day feeling just like it was routine. And it got to a point where I was very dissatisfied with the trajectory of my life. I felt as if there was more in life that I had to do. And growing up, I’ve always known that I wanted to do something in business … I just never knew what I wanted to do, but I’ve always known I wanted to create.”\n\nLeap Into Entrepreneurship In 2021, Spencer’s first swing as a founder was with Kings Crowning, which offered a satin-lined cap that was a functional, stylish, alternative bonnet for men. The business launched from a storage unit and grew into a multimillion-dollar company, leading him to become a first-generation CEO and millionaire by the time he was 27 years old, per Business Insider.\n\nCrowned Skin Fast forward to March 2024, and Spencer is on to his next brainchild, Crowned Skin, a science-backed skincare and grooming brand for men. The inspiration for the company came from a place of frustration while walking down retail aisles, seeing little representation and few innovative products for men in these categories, he told AFROTECH\n.\nSpencer made an upfront investment of between $10,000 and $15,000 into Crowned Skin with the income generated from King’s Crowning, coupled with real estate investments. These funds were recouped within a few months, he recalled. The investment gave him the financial freedom to create products, establish warehousing, and fund advertising.\n“I just wanted to create products that made men feel seen and confident,” Spencer explained. “I think men across the board, there’s this stigma when it comes down to men’s beauty, men’s grooming. It’s this hush topic that men don’t feel comfortable talking about.”\n\nStory Continues\nCrowned Skin offers body butter, cologne, and body oil in a range of scents, including its newest scent, Empire.\nSpencer has been intentional with growing the company to be profitable and self-sustaining. Strategic decisions, such as pivoting early in Crowned Skin’s marketing messaging, have helped him guide the company towards those goals. Working at various big tech companies as an ads manager allowed him to understand the power of attention and how to retain it.\n\nThis knowledge influenced how the brand positioned its products. Spencer showed the functionality of the products, which include ultra-moisturizing and healing properties; aligned with what would resonate with men, such as the allure of certain scents; and demonstrated the products’ efficiency, as they could cut morning routines in half by functioning as a two-in-one product.\n“We ended up running with those street marketing pieces. And then we learned that through creative messaging, through compelling five- to ten-second ad content around that messaging, that’s what really compelled. That’s what really propelled the business forward very, very fast,” he acknowledged.\n“So then at that point, we were getting our revenue shot up. The business was funding itself. We were very profitable. We were mindful of our return on ad spend, and we were able to scale up as more funds came in. And the next thing we knew, at that point, we really didn’t need any outside investments,” he added. “We didn’t need any other injections of capital … We chose to scale intentionally and scale when revenue came in.”\n\nRevenue Crowned Skin earned $4 million in revenue within its first year and is now a multi-million-dollar company, Spencer confirmed to AFROTECH\n. This feat is aided by strong teams across financial, fulfillment, product development, and manufacturing. Additionally, e-commerce has remained a major component of Crowned Skin’s success through Amazon and TikTok Shop, which have particularly helped boost revenue for the venture.\n“If you want to be a highly competitive and successful brand and company in today’s age, you need to diversify, be on every e-commerce channel across the board, and be your best at all of them. TikTok Shop has been huge. TikTok shop is becoming one of our biggest revenue channels. And the way that you can work with affiliates and really seed samples and fuel your company through affiliates, but also the age of live selling on TikTok, we’re coming into a whole new age of e-commerce marketing,” Spencer explained.\nTikTok Shop has become a six-figure-a-month channel for the company. Crowned Skin also makes history as the first Black male-founded skincare company to reach the #2 spot on TikTok Shop, according to information shared with AFROTECH\n.\n“I get to really be a forward-thinking leader in this space as a Black man in an underrepresented category where there’s not many other Black males doing this … This all was self-taught … Representation is everything for me because I think there’s so many other Black men out there that are in that similar position, but honestly, fear might stunt them. I’m really proud that I get to really create this amazing company and showcase all that you can do as a Black man. If you truly put your head down, it really works,” Spencer explained.\n\nFirst Retail Partnership The overarching goal is to position Crowned Skin as a one-stop shop for men’s grooming. There are currently various products in research and development, including body washes and deodorants, Spencer told AFROTECH\n. It will also soon gain greater visibility following its first-ever retail partnership with Walmart.com. There are plans to later expand regionally, then nationally on store shelves, Spencer shared.\nSpencer also stated that he intends to raise a Series A, likely in 2026, to scale the company globally.\n\n“I want Crowned Skin to be around for years and years, and I want it to last even when I’m not here. I want this to be a legacy company … I want global access … That’ll be an amazing opportunity for us to scale to even more heights, bring on an amazing partner or partners right in this space that have done it, that have scaled companies to nine, 10 figures, and that can really position Crowned Skin to be one of the most dominating forces in men’s grooming,” he expressed.\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "If I Could Only Buy and Hold a Single Stock, This Would Be It\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Alphabet remains reasonably priced despite a gain of more than 60% this year.\nThe company recorded its first-ever quarter with more than $100 billion in revenue.\nGoogle Cloud is a difference-maker for Alphabet stock.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nI have been appreciating Warren Buffett more than ever lately as the legendary investor prepares to step down from the helm of Berkshire Hathaway . Buffett has likely had the greatest influence on my investing journey because his buy-and-hold method resonates strongly with me. When Buffett makes a move, I tend to pay attention because I want to see what he and his management team see.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also a huge fan of tech stocks (which is an area that Buffett has often steered clear of). I think tech stocks are among the most interesting investments on Wall Street because the companies are often dynamic and bring innovation to every sector of Wall Street. Whether you have a consumer goods company, a financial services organization, or a healthcare operation, you rely on technological advancements to improve your business and stay ahead of the competition.\nRecently, I have been paying closer attention to a company that offers the best of both worlds. It has outstanding management, strong earnings, and an insurmountable moat (just like Buffett prefers). And it also claims a front-row seat to how the world is changing and will be one of the most critical companies to help us get there.\nMy pick for the best buy-it-today-and-hold-it-forever stock is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nAbout Alphabet stock Alphabet is a member of the \" Magnificent Seven \" group of stocks that's been dominating Wall Street for the last several years, and it's also one of the biggest publicly traded companies in the world. Currently, Alphabet has a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion.\nThe company's stock is up a whopping 61% this year, which is great considering that Alphabet got off to a rough start, falling into bear market territory in April before recovering.\nOf course, with that comes a hefty valuation, but considering the sandbox that Alphabet plays in, its forward price-to-earnings ratio isn't that bad. There are four companies on the planet with a market cap greater than $3 trillion, and Alphabet stacks up favorably to them all.\nWhat to like about Alphabet stock There are two major things I'm looking at with Alphabet right now. First is the company's business model and revenue. And all that is good. Alphabet just turned in its first-ever quarter of $100 billion in revenue, bringing in $102.34 billion in the third quarter, up 16% from last year. The vast majority of that comes from advertising, which brought in $74.18 billion in the quarter thanks to its powerful YouTube platform, as well as its dominant position in internet search, in which Google maintains a 90% market share.\n\nStory Continues\nAll that helps Alphabet maintain 31% operating margin, with net income in the third quarter of $34.97 billion and $2.87 per share, up from $26.3 billion and $2.12 per share a year ago.\nThe second thing that I appreciate is Alphabet's innovation. Faced with a massive threat a year ago, as ChatGPT, TikTok, and other social media platforms threatened to cut into Google's search dominance, Alphabet harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to work in its favor. It rolled out AI Overviews on its search pages, generating summaries to answer users' queries using generative AI and advanced reasoning.\n\nAlphabet also uses AI to optimize and improve advertising, and on YouTube to recommend content.\nFinally, there's Google Cloud, the company's fast-growing cloud computing segment. Cloud computing is a growing field because companies running or training AI programs don't want to invest in expensive semiconductor clusters. Cloud services like Google Cloud are a more reasonable alternative, and it's one of the reasons why Google Cloud revenue jumped 33.5% in the third quarter from a year ago.\nAlphabet's growth curve is expected to continue, which is impressive for a company of its size and maturity.\nAlphabet is a buy right now Of course, I also can't ignore that Berkshire Hathaway took a stake in Alphabet in the third quarter -- and while it's impossible to know if Buffett himself pulled the trigger, the purchase of nearly 18 million shares of Alphabet stock will go down in history as one of the last transactions under Buffett's reign as CEO.\n\nThe company's core advertising business is a profit center that can't be duplicated, despite efforts by competitors such as Microsoft , Meta Platforms , and Amazon to encroach on the digital advertising market. Alphabet has too many advantages, is too entrenched, and management has proven its ability to adapt to any challenges. Meanwhile, the Google Cloud opportunity will continue to provide outsize growth to Alphabet's bottom line.\nI think it's the best stock to have right now for long-term investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Hut 8 CEO says $7 billion data center deal with Google is 'first domino to fall'\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 10:31 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: HUT\n\nGOOG\n\nBTC-USD\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nGS\n\nThe \"crypto miner\" label is becoming a relic of the past for Hut 8 ( HUT ).\nIn a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ). The move effectively trades the volatility of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for the high-margin stability of AI infrastructure.\n\n\"We think that the value of energy will continue to go up, and so for us, we [had] to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers, but that drove a strong return to our shareholders,\" Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\nThe market is rewarding the transformation. The energy infrastructure company's stock surged roughly 20% on Wednesday following the announcement as investors cheered its potential to secure blue-chip partners in a crowded field.\nBeyond the one-day pop, the stock has been a standout in the mining-to-AI pivot, fueled by the company's deep energy assets and its strategic partnership with American Bitcoin ( ABTC ), a Trump family enterprise in which Hut 8 holds a 60% stake. Year to date, Hut 8 stock is up 90%.\n\nThe linchpin of the Louisiana project is a financial guarantee from Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), which guarantees payments of the 15-year lease if Fluidstack, an AI cloud infrastructure provider, cannot meet them. The deal secures 245 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with the possibility to scale up to 2,300 MW within that timeframe — a move that could swell the total lease value to $17.7 billion.\n\n\"We're very excited because it's the first domino to fall,\" Genoot said. \"If we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full strategic partnership on 2,300 MW, we see a lot of growth upside for the company and the deal overall.\"\nThe creditworthiness was the key. Genoot noted that without Google's involvement, securing project financing from titans like JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) at favorable rates would have been nearly impossible.\nHe added that Google has a \"strong core business,\" including diversified cash flows from Search, YouTube, and cloud services, making the tech giant's pledge the ultimate security for a 15-year infrastructure play.\nHowever, securing the money is only half the battle. Competitors have seen their stocks hammered due to construction delays. Genoot claims Hut 8 has de-risked the execution side, partly by issuing a \"conservative delivery schedule\" and tapping local labor.\nThe company has turned to established industrial partners, including Jacobs Engineering for design and local contractors like Cajun Electric for electrical services. By scheduling the first data hall delivery for Q2 2027, Genoot said the company is avoiding the \"crunch\" of unrealistic timelines that has plagued the sector.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We signed all of these commitments at the same time,\" Genoot said. \"We're not only delivering a commitment to the customer, but we have commitments from all of our partners that they are going to deliver on that same commitment.\"\nAs Hut 8 doubles down on its new identity, the Miami-based company may still be undervalued by a market that largely views it through a crypto lens.\nAccording to Genoot, the Louisiana deal is just the beginning. \"It's about repeating this program again and again and again to start growing the value of this company,\" he said.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nYouTube's first telecast will be the 101st Academy Awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said it signed a multiyear deal running from 2029 through 2033. The agreement covers more than the awards ceremony itself, including red carpet arrivals, behind the scenes access, and coverage of the Governors Ball. Alphabet said U.S. viewers will be able to watch through YouTube TV, while audiences elsewhere can stream the show for free on YouTube.\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan said the partnership is about bringing the Oscars to a broader global audience while honoring its long standing cultural legacy. The move comes after the Academy's current deal with Disney's ABC, which runs through 2028.\nFor investors, the deal highlights YouTube's growing push into premium live events and its ambition to turn traditional TV moments into global streaming experiences.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Set to commence construction in early 2026, the Citra Energies solar farm will deliver renewable energy to power Google’s data center operations in the country.\nNew Deal Extends TTE’s Existing Collaboration With Google Google wants to utilize clean energy for its new AI based data centers and has been entering into long-term agreements with power providers for 24/7 supply of clean electricity. Last month, Google selected TotalEnergies to supply renewable power for its data centers in the United States.\n\nThe new contract to supply clean energy to Google’s data center in Malaysia seems to be an extension of the existing partnership of both these companies. TotalEnergies has been successfully providing clean energy to its customers across the globe, with is also acting in favour of this multi-energy provider.\n\nHow Will This Deal Benefit TTE? This long-term renewable power supply deal will secure a stable revenue stream for the company.\n\nThis deal will allow TotalEnergies to tap deeply into growing opportunities in the Southeast Asian region in the long run, as this region is experiencing rising demand for power supply due to the establishment of new data centers. The company is set to build a renewable power plant in Malaysia, providing access to the Malaysian market and offering strong, sustainable growth potential.\n\nThis new deal is in sync with TotalEnergies’ long-term vision on clean energy generation. The company is gradually building a portfolio of low-carbon businesses that could account for 15-20% of sales by 2040.\n\nRising Demand for Clean Energy The demand for clean energy is rising due to the development of large AI-based data centers, usage of more electric vehicles and higher usage of residential customers. Given the expected increase in clean energy demand, the power providers are also expanding their clean energy generation capacity.\n\nTotalEnergies continues to expand its clean energy generation capabilities to meet growing customer demand. Gross installed renewable power generation capacity was 32.3 GW at the end of the third quarter of 2025, up from 24.2 GW at the end of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOther operators have also outlined their goals to generate more energy from clean energy sources. With the changing demand scenario, these companies continue to make upward revision in their generation capacity.\n\nPrice Movement of TTE Over the past six months, TTE’s shares have risen 5.4%, which beat the industry’s growth of 1.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nZacks Rank & Key Pick TTE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "3 Best AI ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Quantum computing is an exciting theme, but one that's going to take some time to play out.\nInvestors should consider a broad spectrum of names beyond just the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nThe three ETFs below offer a range of options for investors to gain exposure to the AI sector.\n10 stocks we like better than Defiance Quantum ETF ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already well on its way to being the biggest technological revolution since the internet -- and it's still in the early innings.\nWhile names such as Nvidia , Microsoft , OpenAI , and Alphabet have emerged as the \"faces\" of AI, there are plenty of potential winners throughout the sector. Infrastructure builders, enterprise software creators, application developers, and cloud providers all play an integral part to the ecosystem. AI is far more than just semiconductor manufacturers.\nThat's why when it comes to investing in AI, it may be better to just buy the theme instead of trying to pick individual winners. Some of the biggest returns so far have been delivered by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. But stretched valuations, evidence of slowing momentum, and questions surrounding whether all the AI development spending will be worth it are beginning to plague some companies.\nAn ETF that can maintain exposure to some of those megacap names but look beyond them for additional opportunities may be the way to play it in 2026. Here are the three artificial intelligence ETFs that I'm favoring as we head into the new year.\n1. Defiance Quantum ETF If you're interested in true futuristic tech, quantum computing is probably for you. If artificial intelligence is the next revolution, quantum is the rocket that could really propel it to the next level.\nQuantum computing involves developing the technology for processing and calculating at speeds far beyond what traditional computers can do today. It has potential applications in technology, medicine, energy, finance, scientific discovery, and more.\n\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF (NASDAQ: QTUM) invests in companies at the forefront of quantum development. Top holdings right now include Tower Semiconductor , Rigetti Computing , Teradyne , Coherent , and Micron Technology .\nThe only Magnificent Seven name among the top 10 holdings is Alphabet, and it only comes in at No. 10, with a weight of 1.8%. So there's good diversification here relative to the broader tech sector and the equity market in general.\nQuantum is a little more niche and a lot more appropriate for a long-term holding than traditional AI stocks. It may be years before quantum becomes anything close to having mainstream applications, so it should be considered an investment in potential more than concrete current results.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF The Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) looks more like a traditional big tech ETF, but it's careful to include companies of all sizes and from all around the world. In that way, it's designed to be a more inclusive and comprehensive take on AI investing.\nThe fund's index starts by grouping companies in two categories:\n\nAI developers: Includes product and services developers and users, as well as companies that offer AI solutions as a service to customers.\nAI and big data analytics: Semiconductor, storage, and/or hardware manufacturers, as well as quantum computing developers.\nA minimum \"exposure score\" is required for inclusion. Qualifying components are weighted by market cap.\nAIQ is a nice middle ground between big and small companies, although it definitely tilts toward large caps. The AI exposure requirement is a nice way to build the portfolio and ensure that the fund is more of a pure AI play than just a generic megacap tech fund.\n3. Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) describes itself as the world's first generative AI ETF. It's unique in that it's the only actively managed fund among the three, which is advantageous in such a rapidly evolving space. But it also leans more toward the megacap names.\n\nTop holdings currently include Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms , and Palantir . Amazon , Broadcom , and Advanced Micro Devices also reside in the top 10, so there's very much a Nasdaq-100 index feel to this fund.\nIf you're looking for a straightforward, more \"conservative\" way to invest in AI, CHAT might not be a bad choice. You get the heavy large-cap exposure without a lot of the risk that comes from investing in newer or emerging names.\nShould you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF right now?

( HUT ) unveiled its own partnership with Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Fluidstack to build an AI data center in Louisiana. Alphabet's Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) is providing the backstop on this latter deal.\nHut 8 CEO Asher Genoot joins Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to explain how vital Google was to making this deal happen. Also watch Asher Genoot explain some of the details of the data center deal.\nHut 8 also owns a majority stake in American Bitcoin ( ABTC ), which was co-founded by Eric and Donald Trump, Jr.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nHow important was it that Google backstopped all this?\n00:03 Asher\nCritical. I mean, without Google, we would not be able to get JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs to commit the balance sheet financing to be able to give us up to 85% of the actual cost to build a data center for project financing, and at a really low rate of SOFR plus 2.25% target. And so overall, the the clarity of Google backstopping, and think about this.\n00:30 Asher\nIt's a $7 billion deal, that's roughly $450 million a year.\n00:33 Asher\n$450 million on average a year for 15 years for Hut 8 transforms the business. You look at mostly data center infrastructure multiples trade at a 15 to 20x multiple. That's somewhere between 7 and a half to 9 billion dollars of overall value. You take out the build costs, you're at 5 and a half to 7 billion dollars of equity value creation. And so overall, we're extremely excited because if you think about the company today, 330 megawatts alone is worth more than our full market cap today.\n01:10 Asher\nIn addition to that, we own 60% of American Bitcoin, which is another publicly traded company we have with the Trumps. That's worth about a billion dollars. We have about 10,000 Bitcoin on the balance sheet, that's worth another billion dollars. And then we have 9,000 megawatts, 1,000 that we currently operate, another 8,000 of new development megawatts that I haven't even counted. And so we're extremely excited that about the company, its future growth potential. I think this is the first step in showing the market we have an ability to take a site from the very, very beginning on a piece of land that we find to bring it to a commercialized AI data center.\n01:43 Speaker A\nAsher, what's the next step? Because if I, if it's, if I have this correct, you have a pipeline. What does that pipeline look like? And and are you just on the cusp of announcing more deals like you just announced?\n01:54 Asher\nYeah, so when we announced this deal, creating a program with partners that could scale is really important. You brought up Jacobs engineering. They have 40,000 contractors and engineers. You have Vertiv, one of the best equipment manufacturers within the whole data center space. Obviously, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have some of the largest balance sheets as banks. So we put together a group of partners that we believe could scale with us in our development pipeline. And so we spent this whole year creating that foundation, find the right customers who have the demand as well. And now it's about repeating this program again and again and again to start growing the value of this company. And we're extremely excited and we think, uh, if we're on here a year from today, we'll have uh had a lot of headway in the scale that we were able to deploy and develop for our shareholders.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/73b1bf83-705b-3ccc-bb88-7224d05ea345/what-is-ethereum-%28eth%29%3F-a.html",
      "Content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nMatt Hussey,Jason Nelson\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:40 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMETA\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts —self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps , that run without banks, governments, or big tech.\n\nWhen programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain —not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games , digital art , and assets worth billions.\nUltimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.\nThis guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.\nSmart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.\nSmart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.\n\nWho Invented Ethereum? Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.\n\nDevelopment of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nA crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.\n\nThe network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.\nThe switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work\nThis shift, known as “ The Merge ,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.\nBlocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhat applications have been built on Ethereum? 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.\n📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.\n💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.\n💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.\n💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.\n🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.\n\nTimeline: Major milestones in Ethereum Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.\nMid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.\nJuly 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.\nSeptember 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.\nMarch 2016: Homestead upgrade improves protocol security and usability.\nApril 2016: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, launches via crowdsale.\nJune 2016: Hackers exploit The DAO and drain roughly $50 million in Ether. Community votes to hard-fork, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\nOctober 2017: Byzantium hard fork enhances performance, privacy, and sets the stage for Proof-of-Stake.\nDecember 2017: CryptoKitties and CryptoPunk NFTs go viral, stressing network capacity and highlighting scalability issues.\nJanuary 2018: ERC-721 NFT standard is introduced, enabling unique digital assets.\nDecember 2020: Beacon Chain launches, beginning Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake.\nMarch 2020: Visa begins settling USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin transactions using Ethereum.\nApril 2021: Berlin hard fork reduces gas costs.\nAugust 2021: London hard fork activates EIP-1559 ; introduces fee burning, reducing inflation.\nSeptember 15, 2022: “The Merge” transitions Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, cutting energy use by more than 99 percent.\nApril 12, 2023: The Shanghai upgrade enables withdrawal of staked Ether from the Beacon Chain.\nMarch 13, 2024: The Dencun upgrade introduces proto-danksharding, a step toward reducing costs and increasing scalability.\nMay 7, 2025: The Pectra upgrade, combining Prague and Electra updates, aims to expand staking flexibility and improve Ethereum’s efficiency.\nDecember 3, 2025: The Fusaka upgrade introduces changes to Ethereum's data availability and block capacity.\n\nEthereum and DAOs One of Ethereum’s most radical innovations was the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes . Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.\nThe first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack , but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.\n\nWhat Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?\nSince then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon , to investment collectives like Syndicate , and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO , which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.\nSupporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.\nA network tested by crisis If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.\nEthereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.\nThe community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nEthereum and the NFT boom Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.\nThe breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties , CryptoPunks , and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\nBy 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million , and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.\nEthereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nThe race to scale Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.\nTo address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 . The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.\n\nVitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'\nEthereum and the Web3 vision Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.\n\nBut competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana , Cardano , and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.\nEthereum and privacy In 2025, privacy has become a key focus of the Ethereum project. In November, Vitalik Buterin stated that \"Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene,\" building on a narrative in which he framed it as a fundamental requirement for digital systems such as blockchain platforms.\nEthereum Foundation Launches New Cluster Focused on Privacy\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has followed suit, launching a privacy cluster in October 2025 that includes 47 researchers, coordinators and cryptographers. The Foundation also launched Kohaku, a \"privacy-first\" toolkit for Ethereum, alongside a browser wallet and SDK. Upon its launch, Buterin commented that \"Full-stack privacy and security are first-class priorities in Ethereum.\"\nA decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.\nWhat’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

JPMorgan's 2026 outlook, backed by new CEO survey data, suggests markets are now recalibrating expectations — shifting focus from AI adoption to whether it actually delivers profits.\nGenAI Fell Short Of CEO Expectations PwC's latest global CEO survey, covering more than 4,700 executives across 109 countries, shows a clear expectation gap. While over 40% of CEOs entered 2025 expecting GenAI to boost revenue and nearly half anticipated a lift in profitability, only about one-third reported meaningful gains in either metric by year-end. Efficiency improvements were more visible, but even those undershot initial expectations.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nJPMorgan's interpretation isn't that AI spending was misplaced — it's that monetization arrived slower than anticipated. Adoption moved quickly, but translating that into top-line and margin expansion proved harder than forecasts implied.\nFrom Experimentation To ROI Discipline That gap is now changing behavior. JPMorgan notes that boards and CFOs are pressing harder on return on investment, favoring projects with clearer financial outcomes over open-ended experimentation. Growth alone is no longer enough; it needs to come with margin discipline.\nAs a result, valuation frameworks are tightening. Metrics like the Rule of 40 — and JPMorgan's stricter Rule of X — are reasserting themselves as filters rather than afterthoughts.\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nWhy 2026 Will Look Different The implication for 2026 is straightforward.

Investors are rotating toward companies that can pair innovation with durable earnings power.\nIn the next phase of the cycle, belief won't be enough.

This, coming the day after crypto minor Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a massive data center complex in Louisiana. Hut 8, of course, partners with another Trump family enterprise, American Bitcoin. Joining me now for today's Power player, Asher Ganoot, Hut 8 CEO. Asher, good to see you again. Uh, congrats on this big uh moment for your company.\n00:23 Speaker A\nWalk us through the the process a bit because I sense you have been very disciplined on arriving to this point. It was very very important for you to not make just a bad deal.\n00:39 Asher Ganoot\nWe think that the value of energy will continue to go up. And so for us, we had to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers but that drove a strong return to our shareholders. And so the announcement of our deal yesterday, we had actually two announcements. One was an announcement with Anthropic to have the opportunity to scale with them for 2,300 overall megawatts. Then the actual deal we signed itself that was $7 billion was only 330 megawatts, which is 245 megawatts of IT load.\n01:13 Asher Ganoot\nAnd so, for 245 megawatts of IT load, we announced a $7 billion deal that had a financial financial backstop with Google. And so, we're very, very excited because this is the first domino to fall. Um, if we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full uh strategic partnership on 2,300 megawatts, we see a lot of growth upside for the company. And the deal overall, not only did we announce that Google was creating a financial backstop, we had great partners like Fluidstack and Anthropic, but also that we had execution partners to deliver the data center.\n01:46 Asher Ganoot\nFrom JP Morgan to Goldman Sachs providing the financing, and to Jacob's Engineering and to Vertive providing the contracting and the supply chain. This deal is fully packaged and signed to be able to deliver for the customer.\n02:00 Speaker A\nYeah, Jacobs Jacobs is really a uh really one of those under the radar infrastructure plays. really enjoyed uh following their following their story. For the average investor out there, Asher, why would an Anthropic need this much power? Break that down for us.\n02:14 Asher Ganoot\nThey're growing month over month. I mean, if you look at some of the public reports, their revenue has been increasing by billion dollars ARR every single month. And so as they continue to grow, they need additional compute to keep up with the demand of their users. And so they're one of the fastest growing companies in the world right now, and we'd like to provide the our first infrastructure layer to be able to allow them to keep up with that demand and continue to build out those models and those inference and training solutions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Charlie Munger Said, 'Find A Way To Get Your Hands On $100,000' Even If It Means Walking Everywhere — The Magic Number If You Want To Be Rich\n\nJeannine Mancini\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nCharlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

The 15 year, US$7.00 billion Fluidstack lease directly strengthens the near term catalyst of more predictable, infrastructure like cash flows, but it does not remove the key risks tied to Bitcoin exposure, project execution and the capital intensity of River Bend and other builds.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement is the Anthropic and Fluidstack partnership, which sets a framework for Hut 8 to deploy at least 245 MW and potentially up to 2,295 MW of AI data center capacity. That context matters for this lease because it links the River Bend campus to an identified AI tenant ecosystem, reinforcing the idea that Hut 8’s growth runway increasingly depends on executing large, complex AI and high performance computing projects alongside Bitcoin focused operations.\nYet the biggest risk investors should be aware of is how quickly execution or Bitcoin volatility could pressure...\nRead the full narrative on Hut 8 (it's free!)\nHut 8’s narrative projects $767.3 million in revenue and $140.6 million in earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Tesla’s ‘Musk Premium’ in Focus With SpaceX IPO in View\n\nJordan Fitzgerald\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nMU\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\n(Bloomberg) -- (Updates stock price after Thursday’s open)\nElon Musk is selling investors a future of driverless cars, robot assistants and life on Mars. The problem for investors is there’s only one way to buy into his vision: Tesla Inc.’s stock.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker’s shares were up nearly 3% on Thursday. They hit their first record of the year on Tuesday amid gains of more than 20% over the last four weeks. Since tumbling to a low on April 8 during the height of panic over the Trump administration’s tariffs, the stock has soared almost 120%, putting it among the 20 best performers in the S&P 500 Index.\nThe rally is a testament to Wall Street’s faith in Musk’s artificial intelligence ambitions, particularly since Tesla’s core auto business is struggling. But it has also made Tesla shares extremely expensive. At 214 times earnings over the next 12 months, the stock has the second highest valuation in the S&P 500, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and far ahead of number three, Palantir Technologies Inc., another high-flyer that trades at 178 times forward earnings as of Wednesday’s close.\n\n“The valuation doesn’t make any sense,” said Vikram Rai, portfolio manager and macro trader at First New York, which sold its Tesla position earlier this year after Musk and President Donald Trump had a very public fallout on social media.\nA Tesla representative didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nWith Musk’s SpaceX possibly going public next year, stock traders looking for “Elon exposure” will likely have another way to get it before long. The space exploration company is planning an insider share sale that would value it at $800 billion, making it the most expensive privately held business in the world. Its initial public offering would be the largest ever.\n\n“A SpaceX IPO could lead to some selling pressure on Tesla shares,” said Dmitry Shlyapnikov, an analyst at Horizon Investments who works with portfolio managers. “There are investors that own Tesla for exposure to Elon’s ideas and not for the car company attached to the ticker.”\nOf course, there’s another school of thought that a SpaceX public stock offering would shine a spotlight on Musk, giving Tesla another jolt of momentum.\n\nStory Continues\n“Historically, when one of Musk’s companies achieves a major milestone, it tends to lift sentiment for the others,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. “A high-profile SpaceX IPO could attract a fresh wave of investors who are drawn to his innovation story — and that enthusiasm often spills over into Tesla.”\n\nSo far, Tesla’s stock price is getting a boost from the hype surrounding SpaceX, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. The missions of the two companies are interlinked, he said, describing a future where Tesla’s Optimus robots help with Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, and SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system bolsters vehicle connectivity on Earth.\nThe companies also share lofty valuations. But Tesla skeptics question whether the company’s fundamentals can support those numbers. Its sales are slowing and profits are falling, while regulations rise and consumers spend less on cars.\n“If you’ve been long Tesla stock, you’ve made money, there’s no denying it,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, who has a small short position in Tesla. “It’s just bizarre to me because the fundamentals are so bad.”\n\n‘Double-Down on Elon’\nOptimists, on the other hand, point to Tesla’s growth prospects with opportunities in autonomous driving and robotaxis. Musk’s goal is to transform Tesla from an auto manufacturer to an artificial intelligence and robotics company. He wrote in a September X post that 80% of the firm’s profits will eventually come from robots.\n“We believe Tesla’s earnings are going to be growing at 30% to 35% over the next two to three years based on the innovation that they have in the automotive segment,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns the company’s shares.\nIf Musk can pull that off, Tesla’s stock market valuation would make more sense. If he can’t, that’s where SpaceX comes in. Publicly traded shares of SpaceX would give investors the opportunity to own a piece of Musk’s vision without Tesla’s baggage.\n\n“I think most investors will not want to double-down on Elon,” First New York’s Rai said. “That is a lot of risk to carry.”\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce disagrees.\n“We don’t see investors making an either/or choice, but instead backing both companies,” he said. “Investors that have made money in Tesla are likely to want to back another Musk venture.”\nFor now, the reality for investors is Tesla is the only way to bet on Musk’s vision. The immediate risk is the stock’s valuation, which is getting close to dangerous territory. On a technical level, the shares had been close to being considered overbought earlier this week. When they last reached that level in early October, the stock fell 10% over the next seven sessions.\n“In the short term, it’s probably ready for a bit of a cooling off type of period after having that all-time high,” Mulberry said.\n\nBut to long-term Musk believers, the valuation may indeed be a short-term concern.

      "Content": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nKO\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Beverage behemoth Coca-Cola is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s longest-held and biggest positions.\nYou know Amazon as an e-commerce powerhouse, but that’s not quite what makes it such a promising long-term prospect.\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet has proven it’s willing and able to successfully build or acquire businesses that expand its digital consumer-facing ecosystem.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nThe end of an era is almost upon us. After 55 years at the helm, at the end of this year, Warren Buffett will be stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and chief stock-picker.\nAnd when he goes, many members of the investment community could find themselves at a loss. Although Berkshire isn't just a mutual fund, plenty of investors took Buffett's lead by copying Berkshire's trades; now the conglomerate's stock picks won't necessarily be Buffett-approved holdings. So, if you want to know for sure that you're following in his footsteps, you'd better act soon.\nTo this end, here's a rundown of three names currently in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio that you not only know the Oracle of Omaha likes well enough to own them, but each of which could safely be bought and held forever.\n1. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) isn't just one of Berkshire's longest-held positions at 19 years. It's also become the conglomerate's third-biggest holding, currently worth $28 billion. That's 10% of Berkshire's entire publicly traded portfolio.\nIt's not hard to see why Buffett's been such a long-term fan of the beverage giant, either. Not only is it the biggest and best-known name in the business, but it's a dividend machine! In addition to paying a dividend like clockwork for decades, The Coca-Cola Company has raised its per-share dividend payment for 63 consecutive years (and counting). This year, Berkshire's 400 million shares of KO will provide Buffett and his lieutenants with more than $200 million in cash. Never even mind the near-200% gain this stock's price alone has produced since Buffett first bought it back in late 2006.\n\nIt's also a great \"forever\" stock for two other reasons. One of these is simply that the world will always need something to drink. With brands like Gold Peak tea, Powerade sports drinks, Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, and, of course, its namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company has something to offer everyone.\nAnd the other reason this name's got staying power worth buying into? Its sheer size (read \"deep pockets\") -- the drinks giant can afford to outspend its competitors. For perspective, Coca-Cola spent more than $5 billion on advertising last year alone.\n\nStory Continues\nNo, it may not be fair. Investors don't want a fair fight, however. They want the companies they own to have an unfair advantage over their competition.\n2. Amazon Yes, Berkshire Hathaway holds a stake in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . It's not a big stake, mind you -- just 10 million shares currently worth about $2.2 billion. That's less than 1% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\nStill, the fact that he's willing to let Berkshire hold any Amazon at all is noteworthy just because Buffett has typically eschewed such flashy technology stocks, explaining that he doesn't always fully understand their business models. And to be sure, the pick was likely encouraged by Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler, who help oversee the conglomerate's equity holdings.\n\nThe pick also makes much more sense to Buffett now, however, than it would have several years ago.\nWhile Amazon may have been something of an unknown in its infancy (when the internet itself was still young and evolving, and when Buffett was forming his previous opinion on most technology stocks), even he would have to agree that uncertainty no longer applies. E-commerce is clearly here to stay, and Amazon clearly leads at least the U.S. e-commerce market; it isn't doing too badly overseas either. All told, despite its already-massive size, this company's product sales are up more than 8% through the first three quarters of this year. This growth rate accelerated last quarter, too, despite the lethargic economy here and abroad.\nAmazon isn't just e-commerce anymore, either. Although it only accounts for a minority of its revenue, its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, contributes roughly 60% of the company's total operating income. And the cloud computing industry is here to stay as well. Indeed, Straits Research expects the worldwide cloud computing industry to grow from less than $1 trillion this year to nearly $3.7 trillion per year by 2033.\n\nWhat makes this name such a great forever holding, however, is that -- not unlike Berkshire Hathaway itself -- Amazon has proven that it's willing and able to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace of opportunities.\n3. Alphabet Finally, add Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold forever for yourself.\nThere are actually several clear parallels between Berkshire's positions in Amazon and Alphabet. Both are holdings that wouldn't have likely even been considered as potential picks a few years ago, for instance, yet both businesses have clearly solidified in the meantime. Both companies are also flexible; Amazon added cloud computing to its repertoire several years ago and is now turning its online shopping platform into an advertising medium, while Alphabet has moved well beyond its Google search engine with profit centers like YouTube and its own cloud computing service. Berkshire doesn't exactly have a huge stake in either outfit, only holding 17.8 million shares currently worth about $5.5 billion. That's less than 2% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\n\nIt's also a pretty safe bet that this position is the result of prodding from Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.\nWhatever the case, Buffett's pseudo-endorsement of Alphabet serves as a green light of sorts for you, plugging you into the company that still handles 90% of the world's web searches (according to Statcounter).\nThat's not the chief reason Alphabet is such a great long-term bet, though. The biggest and best bullish argument here is a more philosophical one. That's Alphabet's willingness and ability to build or buy a business, anything that allows it to expand its digital ecosystem.\nYouTube is one example; Google acquired it back in 2006. Alphabet's chat-based artificial intelligence platform Gemini is another example, as is 2004's launch of Gmail and 2005's acquisition of mobile operating system Android, which Statcounter says is installed on 72% of the world's mobile devices.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" arm is home to developing self-driving taxi service Waymo and life-science outfit Verily.\nSome of these projects pan out. Others don't. There's a reason, however, that Alphabet has only failed to produce year-over-year quarterly revenue growth once in the past 10 years. That's the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 -- and that was a short-lived headwind. Its profit growth has been almost as persistent. There's no end in sight to this growth streak, either. There's just too much worldwide dependence on Alphabet's offerings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Trump Media is merging with fusion power company TAE Technologies in $6B+ deal\n\nTim De Chant, Amanda Silberling\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies , a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.\nThe all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.\n\nTMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch , the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”\nTMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.\nTruth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.\n\nTMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.\nBut the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.\nCurrently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion , are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.\n\nIf one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.\n\nOver the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.\nIn the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.\nAfter the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI data centers are eating the memory industry, and it could hurt your wallet\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 5:09 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSSNLF\n\n000660.KS\n\nMemory maker Micron ( MU ) reported a blowout first quarter earnings report on Wednesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines and offering a better-than-anticipated outlook for the second quarter, as data center builders look to grab as much of the company's memory chips as possible.\nMicron builds memory, known as DRAM, for data centers. And as data center construction booms in the US, that memory is selling at a premium.\n\nThere's just one problem: DRAM is also used in devices like smartphones and laptops.\nConsumer PCs and other systems use a type of DRAM called double data rate memory (DDR), while data centers use a version of DRAM called high-bandwidth memory, HBM.\nDRAM suppliers are currently focusing more on building HBM than DRAM, thanks to higher margins on data center parts. And that's starving the broader market.\nIt's not just PC buyers who are feeling the sting, either. Everything from cars to medical equipment could be impacted by the dearth of memory chips.\nCompounding that is the fact that, ahead of its earnings, Micron announced that it is exiting the consumer memory business to focus on providing memory to AI data centers.\n\"It's not going to be good for consumers, because it's driving prices up, and very soon,” Ryan Reith, group vice president for IDC's worldwide device tracker, told Yahoo Finance.\nA massive memory crunch While most of us tend to think of GPUs powering AI data centers, they're only part of the server clusters that run apps like OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) ChatGPT and Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Gemini. In addition to CPUs and storage, they also need large pools of memory.\nThe problem? There are only a few major memory manufacturers in the world. That includes big-name companies like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron ( MU ). And the incredible demand for data center equipment is driving up prices across the entire industry.\n\nAccording to Reuters , Samsung has increased the prices of some memory by as much as 60%. Enthusiast site PCPartPicker , which tracks the prices of various memory sticks, shows the cost of some memory climbing from $100 to nearly $450.\n\"I think the general consensus is that in the last month … this has gotten a lot more attention, and not in a positive way,\" Reith said, adding that the price impact will likely end up getting passed through to consumers, especially on low-cost laptops.\nThat's because companies that produce entry-level and midrange systems have less room to maneuver when it comes to pricing before they completely eat through their margins.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"All of those things are essentially PCs. Any embedded device, game consoles, specialized medical equipment, those are all embedded computers, and they all have memory, and they all have storage of some kind,\" TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut memory companies don't necessarily mind if there's a shortage of components for PCs and other systems as long as they're raking in cash on HBM, especially because the margins on HBM are higher than other types of memory.\nThere are some ways device makers can try to offset the increased price of memory, including using cheaper, less powerful components elsewhere in their products or putting pressure on suppliers to reduce costs, explained Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.\nThis isn't the first time the tech industry has had to contend with memory supply problems, however. It is, after all, a notoriously cyclical market.\n\"What happens is, there's huge demand, and capacity gets built out, but it's never smooth,\" O'Donnell said.\n\n\"So … you get to the point where all demand gets sucked up, so you build these new factories, then you end up with a ton more capacity, and then the prices drop precipitously because there's too much capacity,\" he added.\nBut with so many companies building data centers across the globe, it's difficult to tell when the memory market will come back down.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The credits were purchased at an average weighted price of $362 per ton.\nNULIFE uses high-pressure cooking to break down waste into substances such as bio-oil, which is injected into salt caverns more than 1,000 metres underground ⁠for permanent storage. Frontier estimates the ​technology could scale to 1.5 gigatons of ​carbon removal annually by 2040.\n\"The goal at Frontier is really to create a portfolio of solutions that we ‍think are most ⁠likely to go the distance to a gigaton scale future,\" Hannah Bebbington Valori, Frontier’s head of deployment, said in an interview.\nScientists ⁠say carbon removal projects are critical to offset emissions from sectors that continue ‌to rely on fossil fuels.\n(Reporting by Simon Jessop and ‌Susanna Twidale.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments.

      "Content": "Got $1,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nORCL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia boasts of exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\nAlphabet’s full-stack AI approach is proving to be a key competitive advantage.\nIonQ can prove to be a high-growth, high-risk addition to a large and well-diversified investment portfolio.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe Federal Reserve's much-awaited 25-basis-point interest rate cut, announced on Dec. 10, has not delivered the market relief many investors had hoped for. While tech stocks initially jumped, the optimism was quickly replaced as renewed concerns around artificial intelligence (AI)-powered stocks resurfaced. Investor sentiment has further deteriorated after AI cloud giant Oracle missed earnings estimates in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Nov. 30, 2025), raising concerns about its ability to convert high-level capital investment into sustained profits.\nWith markets swinging sharply in response to changing sentiment, long-term investors can convert today's uncertainty into an entry opportunity. In case you have $1,000 not required to pay bills and debt or kept aside for contingencies, then investing in any of these three stocks can help generate wealth in the long run.\n\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might seem like the most obvious buy-and-hold pick for decades, and for good reason.\nThe company's exceptional long-term order visibility, worth nearly $500 billion of Blackwell and Rubin systems through 2025 and 2026, is itself a strong indicator of the durability of its long-term growth trajectory. While $150 billion in orders have already shipped, $350 billion worth of orders remain. Nvidia has expanded its strategic partnership with Saudi Public Investment Fund-backed AI company HUMAIN to jointly deploy up to 600,000 of its latest GPU systems over the next three years. This, coupled with a new compute capacity supply agreement with Anthropic, has expanded Nvidia's multiyear demand in addition to the $500 billion.\n\nThe reopening of the Chinese market is also a significant growth catalyst, considering that Nvidia once earned nearly 20% to 25% of its data center revenue from this market. Recently, the U.S. government approved the export of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, provided that 25% of the revenue is paid to the U.S. Treasury. According to a Reuters report, the company has informed Chinese clients that it is evaluating options to expand H200 chip production to meet the surging demand. While the Chinese government has yet to formally approve the purchases of these chips, the report notes that several Chinese technology companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already contacted Nvidia to secure supply.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the stellar demand, visibility, and expanding market access, Nvidia stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 23 and a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.48. While the stock may experience short-term volatility due to changes in hyperscaler spending and policy shifts, its long-term growth story remains intact. Hence, investors should be picking up a stake in this stock, especially at its current reasonable valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has also become a crucial player in the global development of AI infrastructure. The company exited the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025) with a Google Cloud backlog of $155 billion, up 46% on a sequential basis. Customers also entered into a larger number of deals valued at over $1 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared to the combined total of the previous two years. Additionally, nearly 70% of the company's cloud customers are already using the company's AI products.\n\nThe rapid pace of enterprise adoption and improved multiyear revenue visibility of Google Cloud can be partly attributed to the company's full-stack AI strategy, spanning AI infrastructure, proprietary chips, AI models, and enterprise platforms. The full-stack approach is helping Google Cloud support large-scale AI deployments more efficiently. This, in turn, is contributing to improving margins and deepening existing customer relationships.\nBeyond Cloud, Alphabet's strategy of embedding AI across its ecosystem is also delivering strong results. AI experiences are already driving higher engagement in Search through AI Mode and AI Overviews. The company is seeing a higher number of overall queries, including commercial queries, which present additional avenues for monetization. YouTube is also benefiting from AI-driven recommendation systems and is witnessing robust double-digit revenue growth from advertising and subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet is generating durable cash flows from its consumer products, while Google Cloud is well positioned to ride the multiyear enterprise AI wave. The company trades at 27.6 times forward earnings, which appears rich. However, considering its scale, diversified revenue base, and technological edge, Alphabet can be a solid long-term pick even at an elevated valuation level.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is too speculative to serve as a core holding in a diversified portfolio. However, this quantum computing specialist could still merit a small allocation for investors seeking exposure to its long-term growth optionality or those growth drivers that cannot be fully modeled.\nIonQ has delivered exceptional top-line performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), with revenue soaring 222% year over year to $39.9 million, exceeding even the upper end of its own guidance by 37%. IonQ also has $3.5 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet, allowing the company to invest in future growth initiatives.\n\nManagement has highlighted multiple technical and product-specific milestones. The company successfully deployed its #AQ 64 Tempo system (capable of running large and complex quantum circuits) three months ahead of schedule and achieved a record two-qubit fidelity of 99.99% (meaning the system executes two-qubit operations correctly 99.99% of the time).\nIonQ is focused on expanding its presence beyond quantum computing, into associated areas, such as quantum networking, sensing, and security, through targeted acquisitions, including that of Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, and a controlling stake in ID Quantique. The company is also exploring commercialization opportunities through large-scale solutions-based contracts and a land-and-expand strategy. The company is thus striving to build long-term and sticky client relationships.\n\nStill, investors should remain aware of IonQ's risks, considering that the company is loss-making and incurring significant expenses on innovation. IonQ stock trades at 208.3 times sales, which is also very rich. Yet, the stock can be a good addition provided it does not exceed 5% of a large diversified portfolio.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?
