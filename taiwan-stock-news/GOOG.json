      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Charlie Munger Said, 'Find A Way To Get Your Hands On $100,000' Even If It Means Walking Everywhere — The Magic Number If You Want To Be Rich\n\nJeannine Mancini\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nCharlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

Find the list for free.\nHut 8 Investment Narrative Recap To own Hut 8 today, you need to believe it can evolve from a Bitcoin price sensitive miner into a contracted power and compute platform, while actually delivering its massive development pipeline. The 15 year, US$7.00 billion Fluidstack lease directly strengthens the near term catalyst of more predictable, infrastructure like cash flows, but it does not remove the key risks tied to Bitcoin exposure, project execution and the capital intensity of River Bend and other builds.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement is the Anthropic and Fluidstack partnership, which sets a framework for Hut 8 to deploy at least 245 MW and potentially up to 2,295 MW of AI data center capacity. That context matters for this lease because it links the River Bend campus to an identified AI tenant ecosystem, reinforcing the idea that Hut 8’s growth runway increasingly depends on executing large, complex AI and high performance computing projects alongside Bitcoin focused operations.\nYet the biggest risk investors should be aware of is how quickly execution or Bitcoin volatility could pressure...\nRead the full narrative on Hut 8 (it's free!)\nHut 8’s narrative projects $767.3 million in revenue and $140.6 million in earnings by 2028. This requires 76.9% yearly revenue growth and a $13.4 million earnings decrease from $154.0 million today.\n\nUncover how Hut 8's forecasts yield a $56.12 fair value , a 40% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$24 to US$56.13, showing just how far apart individual views on Hut 8 can be. Against that backdrop, the scale of the new US$7.00 billion River Bend lease highlights how much of Hut 8’s future now hinges on successfully commercializing large AI and infrastructure projects, so it is worth exploring several alternative viewpoints before forming your own stance.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 4 other fair value estimates on Hut 8 - why the stock might be worth 40% less than the current price!\nBuild Your Own Hut 8 Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nKO\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Beverage behemoth Coca-Cola is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s longest-held and biggest positions.\nYou know Amazon as an e-commerce powerhouse, but that’s not quite what makes it such a promising long-term prospect.\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet has proven it’s willing and able to successfully build or acquire businesses that expand its digital consumer-facing ecosystem.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nThe end of an era is almost upon us. After 55 years at the helm, at the end of this year, Warren Buffett will be stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and chief stock-picker.\nAnd when he goes, many members of the investment community could find themselves at a loss. Although Berkshire isn't just a mutual fund, plenty of investors took Buffett's lead by copying Berkshire's trades; now the conglomerate's stock picks won't necessarily be Buffett-approved holdings. So, if you want to know for sure that you're following in his footsteps, you'd better act soon.\nTo this end, here's a rundown of three names currently in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio that you not only know the Oracle of Omaha likes well enough to own them, but each of which could safely be bought and held forever.\n1. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) isn't just one of Berkshire's longest-held positions at 19 years. It's also become the conglomerate's third-biggest holding, currently worth $28 billion. That's 10% of Berkshire's entire publicly traded portfolio.\nIt's not hard to see why Buffett's been such a long-term fan of the beverage giant, either. Not only is it the biggest and best-known name in the business, but it's a dividend machine! In addition to paying a dividend like clockwork for decades, The Coca-Cola Company has raised its per-share dividend payment for 63 consecutive years (and counting). This year, Berkshire's 400 million shares of KO will provide Buffett and his lieutenants with more than $200 million in cash. Never even mind the near-200% gain this stock's price alone has produced since Buffett first bought it back in late 2006.\n\nIt's also a great \"forever\" stock for two other reasons. One of these is simply that the world will always need something to drink. With brands like Gold Peak tea, Powerade sports drinks, Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, and, of course, its namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company has something to offer everyone.\nAnd the other reason this name's got staying power worth buying into? Its sheer size (read \"deep pockets\") -- the drinks giant can afford to outspend its competitors. For perspective, Coca-Cola spent more than $5 billion on advertising last year alone.\n\nStory Continues\nNo, it may not be fair. Investors don't want a fair fight, however. They want the companies they own to have an unfair advantage over their competition.\n2. Amazon Yes, Berkshire Hathaway holds a stake in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . It's not a big stake, mind you -- just 10 million shares currently worth about $2.2 billion. That's less than 1% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\nStill, the fact that he's willing to let Berkshire hold any Amazon at all is noteworthy just because Buffett has typically eschewed such flashy technology stocks, explaining that he doesn't always fully understand their business models. And to be sure, the pick was likely encouraged by Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler, who help oversee the conglomerate's equity holdings.\n\nThe pick also makes much more sense to Buffett now, however, than it would have several years ago.\nWhile Amazon may have been something of an unknown in its infancy (when the internet itself was still young and evolving, and when Buffett was forming his previous opinion on most technology stocks), even he would have to agree that uncertainty no longer applies. E-commerce is clearly here to stay, and Amazon clearly leads at least the U.S. e-commerce market; it isn't doing too badly overseas either. All told, despite its already-massive size, this company's product sales are up more than 8% through the first three quarters of this year. This growth rate accelerated last quarter, too, despite the lethargic economy here and abroad.\nAmazon isn't just e-commerce anymore, either. Although it only accounts for a minority of its revenue, its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, contributes roughly 60% of the company's total operating income. And the cloud computing industry is here to stay as well. Indeed, Straits Research expects the worldwide cloud computing industry to grow from less than $1 trillion this year to nearly $3.7 trillion per year by 2033.\n\nWhat makes this name such a great forever holding, however, is that -- not unlike Berkshire Hathaway itself -- Amazon has proven that it's willing and able to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace of opportunities.\n3. Alphabet Finally, add Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold forever for yourself.\nThere are actually several clear parallels between Berkshire's positions in Amazon and Alphabet. Both are holdings that wouldn't have likely even been considered as potential picks a few years ago, for instance, yet both businesses have clearly solidified in the meantime. Both companies are also flexible; Amazon added cloud computing to its repertoire several years ago and is now turning its online shopping platform into an advertising medium, while Alphabet has moved well beyond its Google search engine with profit centers like YouTube and its own cloud computing service. Berkshire doesn't exactly have a huge stake in either outfit, only holding 17.8 million shares currently worth about $5.5 billion. That's less than 2% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\n\nIt's also a pretty safe bet that this position is the result of prodding from Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.\nWhatever the case, Buffett's pseudo-endorsement of Alphabet serves as a green light of sorts for you, plugging you into the company that still handles 90% of the world's web searches (according to Statcounter).\nThat's not the chief reason Alphabet is such a great long-term bet, though. The biggest and best bullish argument here is a more philosophical one. That's Alphabet's willingness and ability to build or buy a business, anything that allows it to expand its digital ecosystem.\nYouTube is one example; Google acquired it back in 2006. Alphabet's chat-based artificial intelligence platform Gemini is another example, as is 2004's launch of Gmail and 2005's acquisition of mobile operating system Android, which Statcounter says is installed on 72% of the world's mobile devices.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" arm is home to developing self-driving taxi service Waymo and life-science outfit Verily.\nSome of these projects pan out. Others don't. There's a reason, however, that Alphabet has only failed to produce year-over-year quarterly revenue growth once in the past 10 years. That's the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 -- and that was a short-lived headwind. Its profit growth has been almost as persistent. There's no end in sight to this growth streak, either. There's just too much worldwide dependence on Alphabet's offerings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

TAE's backers include tech giant Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Goldman Sachs ( GS ), and oil major Chevron ( CVX ).\n\nThe agreement, valued at more than $6 billion, is a bet on the future of fusion, a type of nuclear technology that mimics the way the sun produces light and heat. Fusion is carbon-free and produces significantly less radioactive waste than traditional nuclear power.\nThe technology is not yet commercially available, but the deal includes an immediate $200 million in cash at signing. This funding is intended to facilitate the start of construction of the company's first utility-scale fusion power plant in 2026.\nUnder the terms of the deal, TMTG and TAE shareholders will each own approximately 50% of the newly combined entity.\nUpon closing, TMTG, currently majority owned by President Trump's revocable trust, will serve as the holding company for Truth Social, Truth+, Truth.Fi, and TAE, among other entities.",

      "Content": "Trump Media is merging with fusion power company TAE Technologies in $6B+ deal\n\nTim De Chant, Amanda Silberling\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies , a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.\nThe all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.\n\nTMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch , the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”\nTMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.\nTruth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.\n\nTMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.\nBut the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.\nCurrently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion , are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.\n\nIf one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.\n\nOver the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.\nIn the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.\nAfter the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Trump Media and Technology Group will be the holding company for businesses including Truth Social platform, TAE Power Solutions and TAE Life Sciences.\n\nTrump Media shares jumped 33% in premarket trading, drawing traction on Stocktwits, a social media hub for retail investors. The money-losing company's stock has declined nearly 70% ​this year.\n\"TAE will also clearly have major political support from President Trump in our view,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.\nFUSION TECHNOLOGY\nCompanies and ‌physicists at national laboratories have been trying for decades to foster fusion reactions, in which light atoms are forced together under extreme temperatures to release huge amounts of energy, a process that fuels the sun.\nBig hurdles to commercialize fusion include getting more energy out of a reaction than what goes into it and developing plants that can withstand streams of fusion reactions to power the grid.\n\nTAE CEO Binderbauer and other fusion company leaders met with U.S. Energy Department officials this month, weeks after the department formed its first ever fusion ⁠office.\nThe company, which has raised more than $1.3 billion in private funding, is aiming ​to develop and sell next‑generation neutral beam systems for fusion and related applications ​in a more cost‑effective manner.\n\nStory Continues\nTrump Media has agreed to provide up to $200 million in cash to TAE at signing and $100 million more upon initial filing of the registration. The deal has been approved by the companies' boards.\nThe ‍two companies plan to begin construction ⁠on the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant after the deal closes.\n\nTrump Media CEO Devin Nunes will be the co-CEO of the new company, along with Binderbauer.

      "Content": "AI data centers are eating the memory industry, and it could hurt your wallet\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 5:09 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSSNLF\n\n000660.KS\n\nMemory maker Micron ( MU ) reported a blowout first quarter earnings report on Wednesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines and offering a better-than-anticipated outlook for the second quarter, as data center builders look to grab as much of the company's memory chips as possible.\nMicron builds memory, known as DRAM, for data centers. And as data center construction booms in the US, that memory is selling at a premium.\n\nThere's just one problem: DRAM is also used in devices like smartphones and laptops.\nConsumer PCs and other systems use a type of DRAM called double data rate memory (DDR), while data centers use a version of DRAM called high-bandwidth memory, HBM.\nDRAM suppliers are currently focusing more on building HBM than DRAM, thanks to higher margins on data center parts. And that's starving the broader market.\nIt's not just PC buyers who are feeling the sting, either. Everything from cars to medical equipment could be impacted by the dearth of memory chips.\nCompounding that is the fact that, ahead of its earnings, Micron announced that it is exiting the consumer memory business to focus on providing memory to AI data centers.\n\"It's not going to be good for consumers, because it's driving prices up, and very soon,” Ryan Reith, group vice president for IDC's worldwide device tracker, told Yahoo Finance.\nA massive memory crunch While most of us tend to think of GPUs powering AI data centers, they're only part of the server clusters that run apps like OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) ChatGPT and Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Gemini. In addition to CPUs and storage, they also need large pools of memory.\nThe problem? There are only a few major memory manufacturers in the world. That includes big-name companies like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron ( MU ). And the incredible demand for data center equipment is driving up prices across the entire industry.\n\nAccording to Reuters , Samsung has increased the prices of some memory by as much as 60%. Enthusiast site PCPartPicker , which tracks the prices of various memory sticks, shows the cost of some memory climbing from $100 to nearly $450.\n\"I think the general consensus is that in the last month … this has gotten a lot more attention, and not in a positive way,\" Reith said, adding that the price impact will likely end up getting passed through to consumers, especially on low-cost laptops.\nThat's because companies that produce entry-level and midrange systems have less room to maneuver when it comes to pricing before they completely eat through their margins.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"All of those things are essentially PCs. Any embedded device, game consoles, specialized medical equipment, those are all embedded computers, and they all have memory, and they all have storage of some kind,\" TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut memory companies don't necessarily mind if there's a shortage of components for PCs and other systems as long as they're raking in cash on HBM, especially because the margins on HBM are higher than other types of memory.\nThere are some ways device makers can try to offset the increased price of memory, including using cheaper, less powerful components elsewhere in their products or putting pressure on suppliers to reduce costs, explained Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.\nThis isn't the first time the tech industry has had to contend with memory supply problems, however. It is, after all, a notoriously cyclical market.\n\"What happens is, there's huge demand, and capacity gets built out, but it's never smooth,\" O'Donnell said.\n\n\"So … you get to the point where all demand gets sucked up, so you build these new factories, then you end up with a ton more capacity, and then the prices drop precipitously because there's too much capacity,\" he added.\nBut with so many companies building data centers across the globe, it's difficult to tell when the memory market will come back down.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided. The report also discusses market trends, drivers of the leading Cloud service providers' capex growth during the quarter, and the outlook for the next year.

      "Content": "Got $1,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nORCL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia boasts of exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\nAlphabet’s full-stack AI approach is proving to be a key competitive advantage.\nIonQ can prove to be a high-growth, high-risk addition to a large and well-diversified investment portfolio.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe Federal Reserve's much-awaited 25-basis-point interest rate cut, announced on Dec. 10, has not delivered the market relief many investors had hoped for. While tech stocks initially jumped, the optimism was quickly replaced as renewed concerns around artificial intelligence (AI)-powered stocks resurfaced. Investor sentiment has further deteriorated after AI cloud giant Oracle missed earnings estimates in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Nov. 30, 2025), raising concerns about its ability to convert high-level capital investment into sustained profits.\nWith markets swinging sharply in response to changing sentiment, long-term investors can convert today's uncertainty into an entry opportunity. In case you have $1,000 not required to pay bills and debt or kept aside for contingencies, then investing in any of these three stocks can help generate wealth in the long run.\n\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might seem like the most obvious buy-and-hold pick for decades, and for good reason.\nThe company's exceptional long-term order visibility, worth nearly $500 billion of Blackwell and Rubin systems through 2025 and 2026, is itself a strong indicator of the durability of its long-term growth trajectory. While $150 billion in orders have already shipped, $350 billion worth of orders remain. Nvidia has expanded its strategic partnership with Saudi Public Investment Fund-backed AI company HUMAIN to jointly deploy up to 600,000 of its latest GPU systems over the next three years. This, coupled with a new compute capacity supply agreement with Anthropic, has expanded Nvidia's multiyear demand in addition to the $500 billion.\n\nThe reopening of the Chinese market is also a significant growth catalyst, considering that Nvidia once earned nearly 20% to 25% of its data center revenue from this market. Recently, the U.S. government approved the export of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, provided that 25% of the revenue is paid to the U.S. Treasury. According to a Reuters report, the company has informed Chinese clients that it is evaluating options to expand H200 chip production to meet the surging demand. While the Chinese government has yet to formally approve the purchases of these chips, the report notes that several Chinese technology companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already contacted Nvidia to secure supply.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the stellar demand, visibility, and expanding market access, Nvidia stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 23 and a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.48. While the stock may experience short-term volatility due to changes in hyperscaler spending and policy shifts, its long-term growth story remains intact. Hence, investors should be picking up a stake in this stock, especially at its current reasonable valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has also become a crucial player in the global development of AI infrastructure. The company exited the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025) with a Google Cloud backlog of $155 billion, up 46% on a sequential basis. Customers also entered into a larger number of deals valued at over $1 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared to the combined total of the previous two years. Additionally, nearly 70% of the company's cloud customers are already using the company's AI products.\n\nThe rapid pace of enterprise adoption and improved multiyear revenue visibility of Google Cloud can be partly attributed to the company's full-stack AI strategy, spanning AI infrastructure, proprietary chips, AI models, and enterprise platforms. The full-stack approach is helping Google Cloud support large-scale AI deployments more efficiently. This, in turn, is contributing to improving margins and deepening existing customer relationships.\nBeyond Cloud, Alphabet's strategy of embedding AI across its ecosystem is also delivering strong results. AI experiences are already driving higher engagement in Search through AI Mode and AI Overviews. The company is seeing a higher number of overall queries, including commercial queries, which present additional avenues for monetization. YouTube is also benefiting from AI-driven recommendation systems and is witnessing robust double-digit revenue growth from advertising and subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet is generating durable cash flows from its consumer products, while Google Cloud is well positioned to ride the multiyear enterprise AI wave. The company trades at 27.6 times forward earnings, which appears rich. However, considering its scale, diversified revenue base, and technological edge, Alphabet can be a solid long-term pick even at an elevated valuation level.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is too speculative to serve as a core holding in a diversified portfolio. However, this quantum computing specialist could still merit a small allocation for investors seeking exposure to its long-term growth optionality or those growth drivers that cannot be fully modeled.\nIonQ has delivered exceptional top-line performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), with revenue soaring 222% year over year to $39.9 million, exceeding even the upper end of its own guidance by 37%. IonQ also has $3.5 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet, allowing the company to invest in future growth initiatives.\n\nManagement has highlighted multiple technical and product-specific milestones. The company successfully deployed its #AQ 64 Tempo system (capable of running large and complex quantum circuits) three months ahead of schedule and achieved a record two-qubit fidelity of 99.99% (meaning the system executes two-qubit operations correctly 99.99% of the time).\nIonQ is focused on expanding its presence beyond quantum computing, into associated areas, such as quantum networking, sensing, and security, through targeted acquisitions, including that of Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, and a controlling stake in ID Quantique. The company is also exploring commercialization opportunities through large-scale solutions-based contracts and a land-and-expand strategy. The company is thus striving to build long-term and sticky client relationships.\n\nStill, investors should remain aware of IonQ's risks, considering that the company is loss-making and incurring significant expenses on innovation. IonQ stock trades at 208.3 times sales, which is also very rich. Yet, the stock can be a good addition provided it does not exceed 5% of a large diversified portfolio.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?
