      "Content": "Why Alphabet Stock Could Double By 2030\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 10:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points The tech company's core ad business is a cash cow, helping fund investments into growth opportunities.\nAlphabet's cloud computing business is seeing impressive momentum.\nThere's a clear path to a potential doubling of Alphabet's stock price by 2030.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nNot only is Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) core business already throwing off tons of cash, but it has a second growth engine that is quickly morphing into a separate material cash machine for the company. When combining this fast-growing cloud computing business with Alphabet's core advertising business (powered by Google Search and YouTube), the technology giant has a lot going for it. Indeed, there may even be a path to the stock doubling in five years -- and that's on top of a huge move higher in 2025.\n\nTo understand why a doubling of Alphabet's stock price by 2030 is possible, let's take a look at the company's underlying business momentum -- and what would need to go right in the coming years for the stock to get to levels above $600.\nWhy the stock has soared Showing Alphabet's impressive momentum, its growth has been accelerating recently. Its revenue grew revenue 14% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, and then 16% in Q3.\n\nBut the tech company 's bottom-line momentum is even more impressive. Alphabet's third-quarter net income hit $35.0 billion, up from $326.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. And earnings per share rose more than 35% year over year.\n\nOf course, aggressive share repurchases have played a key role in the company's outsize earnings-per-share growth relative to its top-line growth. And investors are likely pleased with the company's still-young but growing dividend; in Q1, Alphabet's board approved a 5% dividend increase and a new $70 billion repurchase authorization.\n\nThis business momentum, even as the company returns huge sums of capital to shareholders, helps explain the stock's significant move higher this year. Shares have gained an extraordinary 62% year to date.\nWhy the stock can keep climbing Alphabet's main catalyst to watch over the next five years, in addition to an already strong core advertising business, is its cloud computing business, Google Cloud. The segment's revenue rose 34% year over year in Q3, hitting $15.2 billion (about 15% of the quarter's total revenue).\nEven more, the segment is proving to be quite lucrative. Google Cloud operating income in Q3 was $3.6 billion, up about 85% year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nIf this segment grows as a percent of overall revenue and continues to become more profitable as it scales, it could provide a substantial boost to the company's overall profits in the coming years.\nBut this buildout will cost a lot of money. Management recently raised its 2025 capital expenditures outlook, saying that it now expects to spend between $91 billion $93 billion in capital expenditures in 2025. Spending like this will likely pressure free cash flow in the near term, making it critical that Alphabet's big investments eventually pay off.\n\nThe math to a double With this background on the company's momentum in mind, here's the simple math behind a potential double for the stock.\nIf Alphabet trades at about a price-to-earnings ratio of about 25 in 2030 and the stock price is trading at approximately $614 (compared to its current price of about $307), annualized earnings per share would need to be near $24.60.\n\nThat implies earnings per share a bit more than doubling from where it sits today on a trailing basis (Alphabet's trailing-12-month earnings per share currently stands at $10.13), and it works out to something like high-teens annual growth over five years.\nTo achieve this, revenue needs to keep growing at a rate similar to what it has been, and expenses need to rise more slowly than sales. Further, repurchases need to keep chipping away at the share count.\nGiven how much AI has been catalyzing Alphabet's business recently, these assumptions seem plausible.\n\nOf course, there are some critical risks. AI could reshape search monetization faster than Alphabet can adapt. Additionally, regulators can force changes that reduce pricing power in ads or make distribution more expensive. Finally, the capital spending cycle for the company to capture its growth opportunities in AI looks like it's going to be intense.\n\nIn short, it's possible -- and arguably even likely -- that Alphabet's stock doubles by the end of 2030. However, investors will need to continually assess the ever-changing risks, particularly given the capital-intensive nature of the company's cloud computing business. If these big investments pay off in even faster revenue growth and margin expansion over time, the stock could easily double. But if strong growth from these investments is never realized, investors may need to reassess the bull case.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "3 Reasons to Buy Alphabet Stock in 2026 (And 1 to Sell)\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Alphabet's core businesses are doing quite well despite investor concerns.\nThe tech giant may be opening up a new business unit with great potential.\nHowever, the stock isn't as cheap as it once was, trading now at a premium.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the top-performing stocks in the whole market in 2025. Its stock has risen over 60%, placing it in the top 30 performers of the S&P 500 in 2025. While the top 30 may not be as impressive as the top 10, investors must realize that Alphabet's size makes this feat all the more impressive.\n\nAlphabet experienced several tailwinds in 2025 that brought its stock price to far below average to in line with its peers. This growth was aided by a positive ruling in its monopoly court case and Alphabet emerging as a leader in the generative AI realm. Those catalysts are gone for 2026, and investors need new reasons for why Alphabet's stock could soar next year.\nI've got three reasons why it will be a successful investment, and one reason it may be time to move on. But is that one reason to sell enough to outweigh the three reasons to buy? Let's find out.\n1. Alphabet's core business is excelling Alphabet has a ton of business units under its umbrella , but none is more important than its core business: Google Search.\nEarlier this year, investors were worried that Google Search may be going away as generative AI was in a position to replace it. However, that hasn't panned out, largely thanks to the integration of AI search overviews, which provide a hybrid generative AI and traditional search experience. This has allowed Google to maintain its market position and thrive in a booming ad market.\n\nIn Q3, Google Search revenue rose 15% year over year, not bad for a mature business unit that's expected to grow in the high single digits to the low double digits. When Alphabet's base business thrives, so does the rest of the company. If Google Search can keep delivering strong results throughout 2026, Alphabet stock will be a great one to own.\n2. Google Cloud is thriving in the AI buildout Another area of its business that's doing quite well is its cloud computing wing, Google Cloud. Cloud computing is thriving for two reasons.\nFirst, traditional workloads are migrating to the cloud because it's much easier than maintaining expensive equipment and computing hardware on-site. Second, artificial intelligence workloads are rapidly coming online, and most companies don't have the resources to build their own giant data center, so they rent computing capacity from a provider like Google Cloud.\n\nStory Continues\nIn Q3, Google Cloud's revenue rose 34% year over year. That's one of Alphabet's fastest-growing segments, and investors shouldn't be surprised to see this growth rate continue throughout 2026.\n3. Alphabet may have a new business unit launching Part of the reason Alphabet's cloud computing business has been so successful is its custom AI chips, Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). TPUs are an alternative to graphics processing units (GPUs) and are suited for specific workloads more than GPUs. This allows them to deliver better performance at a lower cost when running specific workloads, making them a popular option.\n\nCurrently, clients can only gain access to them by renting them through Google Cloud. But that could be changing. Reportedly, Alphabet is in talks with Meta Platforms to sell TPUs outright, which could be a brand-new business unit starting up. That's a revenue stream that investors haven't accounted for, making Alphabet an intriguing stock for 2026.\nAlphabet's stock isn't as cheap as it once was After its strong run in 2025, Alphabet's stock is no longer cheap. It now trades for nearly 30 times forward earnings, which isn't a historically cheap price tag for any stock.\nThis may hamper Alphabet's long-term returns, but only if the market deems the stock too expensive. Many of Alphabet's big tech peers have traded around this valuation level for an extended time period, so it isn't unrealistic to assume that Alphabet can maintain this premium.\nIf it can, Alphabet will be a top stock to own for 2025. If it can't, it could be a rough year.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $506,935 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,067,514 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 958 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 192% for the S&P 500.

(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is among the 14 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Now . According to a Reuters report on Wednesday, Google is working with Meta to make its AI chips better suited to running PyTorch, in a bid to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\nGoogle\nThe initiative, called TorchTPU, aims to position Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) as an alternative to the chipmaker’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) by ensuring compatibility with clients who have built their AI infrastructure on PyTorch. The Meta-built open source project has become one of the most widely used tools for developers.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had for years reserved a major chunk of the TPUs for internal use. However, the tech giant had been discussing with Meta over the possibility of the latter using more TPUs, said the report.\nIn other news, on December 16, Bloomberg reported that self-driving car company Waymo was in talks to generate $15 billion in capital. It plans on raising the additional funds from external investors and its parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which could help value the business at around $110 billion.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns several notable platforms such as Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, and YouTube. The company is also known for pioneering work and research in cloud computing, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "What’s next for EVs after a year of unraveling\n\nHamza Shaban · Senior Reporter\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: F\n\nRIVN\n\nGM\n\nTOYOF\n\nGOOG\n\nThis is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nOne major thing changed the game for the American EV market this year: the elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit .\n\nIn an instant, EVs became much more expensive, and a key incentive for consumers and automakers to accelerate the EV transition vanished.\nIn the place of an electrified future, pushed further away, a more incremental, hybrid present is taking shape.\nEven before the EV policy shift, consumer demand had waned. Concerns lingered over the turn away from gas-powered cars. Higher costs were a factor , but so was unresolved anxiety over a perceived scarcity of charging stations and battery range. And a strain of American machismo — think of the most over-the-top Super Bowl ad aesthetic — continues to reject the technology as something prissy and foreign.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nAutomakers have struggled with the EV transition , and ambitious, revamped lineups have been curtailed.\nThe latest sign came earlier this month , when Ford announced it would abandon plans for several EV models and instead pivot to hybrid and extended-range vehicles. Ford said it would take $19.5 billion in charges related to the EV revamp.\n\nThe European Union is also expected to advance a measure to delay its 2035 ban on sales of internal combustion cars, ceding to national governments and automakers who have pushed for more flexibility .\nThat automakers have pulled back on their EV ambitions marks a major detour for the industry.\nBut the rough going offers clues of what 2026 and the next phase of the EV roadmap will look like: A focus on hybrids, lower cost models, and pressure from international markets will help shape the market.\nFord, for instance, is ending production of its Lightning, the EV variant of the F-150 pickup truck. Taking its place will be a compromise, an extended-range version that uses a gas engine as a generator.\nCrucially, the carmaker is sticking with plans to release a low-cost EV pickup by 2027. That's a sign that carmakers believe affordability and product fit can still make EVs work... just not yet.\nToyota, which was until recently seen as late to the EV space, has embraced the hybrid lineup (where it was first mover with the Prius) as a kind of stepping stone, positioning itself within the sweet spot of consumer preference — eager for better gas mileage, but not quite ready for an EV.\nPolicy changes and competition from low-cost Chinese models do complicate things for the US market. What is considered a broad retreat from pure EVs in America could expose automakers here to the eventual adoption of Chinese and European EVs — which will have the advantage of years of development and consumer feedback.\n\nStory Continues\nIn some ways, the market energy that was once buzzing around EVs has migrated to another transportation disruptor: robotaxis.\nElon Musk's Tesla ( TSLA ) is slated to begin production of its autonomous Cybercab next year, in what its most bullish backers say could add another trillion dollars to its market cap.\n\nAlphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Waymo, seeking to raise money at a valuation of at least $100 billion , has thousands of commercial robotaxis operating in the US. And Uber, through more than a dozen partnerships , has plans to provide robotaxis in at least 10 markets by the end of next year.\nThis isn't exactly the all-electric future that its most bullish proponents had envisioned. But in 2026, a hybrid approach is the recalibration the industry is banking on.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

      "Content": "3 of the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:58 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSM\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points The stocks listed here all have market caps of more than $1 trillion.\nThey are among the leading companies in tech, but their valuations still aren't terribly high with respect to earnings.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAre you worried that you've missed out on the opportunity to generate a great return from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks? There are still plenty of good and reasonably priced AI stocks you can add to your portfolio today. And many of them are already large, safe, and established players in tech.\nHeading into 2026, three AI stocks that I think possess the most upside are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) . Here's why it's not too late to invest in these three tech giants.\nAlphabet It may come as a surprise to some that Alphabet is on this list. It is, after all, already one of the most valuable companies in the world. Its market cap of $3.7 trillion puts it not all that far behind the world's most valuable company, Nvidia , which is worth $4.3 trillion. Once a company gets that valuable, it becomes harder to keep the growth going.\n\nThe reason Alphabet still looks like a fantastic buy going into 2026 is that it can still go higher. For a while, investors were skeptical about its ability to continue to dominate in search, its core business, amid concerns that AI chatbots would steer users away from Google. And there may still be many skeptics out there, which is why Alphabet isn't the most valuable company in the world right now, which I believe is where it should rank given how massive its business is.\nAI has enabled Alphabet to enhance Google Search and add value for creators on YouTube. But don't forget that it also has a rapidly expanding robotaxi business in Waymo. Its cloud business is expanding, and the company is also making its own chips.\nIts operations are far more diverse than many other AI stocks out there, including Nvidia's. And yet, Alphabet's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28. That's modest in comparison to the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF where the average forward earnings multiple is just under 30. Alphabet should command a far higher premium than where it's at today, which is why, even at its current valuation, it can be a no-brainer buy heading into next year.\n\nAmazon Another obvious pick looks to be Amazon, whose valuation is $2.4 trillion, which remains firmly behind both Nvidia and Alphabet. Over the past 12 months, Amazon's stock price has actually declined by 4%. This is another example of an AI stock that may be worthy of a higher valuation.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company is known primarily for its online marketplace and its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a terrific growth driver. But in addition to that, Amazon also has a robotaxi business of its own, Zoox. It's not as big or popular as Waymo, but its toaster-designed vehicles look sleeker and more modern and could be more ideal for operating as robotaxis.\n\nAmazon has also been expanding its same-day delivery of fresh groceries to more markets recently, which can steal some market share from rival Walmart . Amazon has done a great job of predicting and anticipating purchases on its online marketplace, and replicating that success with groceries could make that an underrated opportunity where its AI capabilities can shine and give it an advantage.\nGiven the diversification of Amazon's business and plentiful growth opportunities, this is a stock that should also be worth more; it trades at a forward P/E of 27.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing In contrast to the other tech giants listed above, there's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC as it is also known. Its business is not as diversified, and that works to its advantage. TSMC makes chips for tech companies, including Nvidia. Its low-cost operations make it difficult for Intel and other rivals to compete. The Taiwan-based company plays an important role in the AI world due to the industry's dependence on its foundry.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, TSMC's revenue rose by 30%, and its diluted per-share profit jumped by 39%. Not only has its growth been impressive, but it has incredibly strong operating margins of around 50%.\nThe stock has rallied more than 40% this year and has a $1.5 trillion market cap. But with a forward P/E of just under 24, it's the cheapest stock on this list.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "5 predictions for tech and AI in 2026 from mega-bull Dan Ives\n\nSamuel O'Brient\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:11 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nDan Ives, one of Wall Street's biggest tech bulls, released his predictions for 2026.\nHe thinks the AI revolution is just starting, and that investors shouldn't be spooked by bubble talk.\nIves sees big things coming from Tesla , Google, and Apple next year.\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities unveiled his list of top predictions for the tech sector for 2026, and the outspoken tech bull isn't any less optimistic about what the new year holds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he sees big things ahead for Tesla. Shares of Elon Musk's car company hit a record high this week, but Ives predicts even more gains to come.\nMore broadly, the analyst sees the AI story continuing to unfold in 2026, and urges investors to buckle in for another bullish year in the space.\n\"On one hand this is a 4th Industrial Revolution taking shape with the US leading China on tech for the first in 30 years...while on the other hand the trillions of dollars needed to reach the heights of enterprise/consumer AI Revolution have caused nervousness and doubters among investors,\" Ives said in a note on Friday.\nHere are Ives' biggest predictions for tech and AI in 2026.\nTesla rolls out robotaxis in 30 cities\nIves is as bullish as ever on Tesla and believes that the EV leader will expand its robotaxi reach in 2026.\n\"Tesla will successfully launch Robotaxis in over 30 cities in 2026 and start to scale volume production of Cybercabs,\" Ives predicts.\nThe EV maker still has its bears. Ross Gerber told Business Insider recently that he doesn't think Tesla can catch up in the self-driving car race as Waymo advances rapidly, but Ives remains steadfast in his conviction that Musk's company will win the driverless race.\nHe sees Tesla stock rising 26% in his base case and as much as 68% in his bull case.\nOracle advances in the AI data center market\nOracle has struggled recently after a lackluster earnings report that raised some questions about the strength of the AI trade. However, Ives isn't worried about the concern that the company is overspending on AI . He predicts a turnaround is coming for Oracle stock in 2026.\n\"Oracle successfully builds out its datacenter targets, starts to convert its massive RPO AI backlog and hits $250 per share in 2026 despite the dark negative sentiment on the stock today,\" he predicted.\nApple and Google will team up on AI\nTwo of the biggest names in tech are likely to team up in 2026 to help usher in the next phase of AI, according to Ives. He predicts that a joint venture between Apple and Google is coming, one that will help the iPhone maker catch up to competitors in the AI race.\n\nStory Continues\n\"Apple and Google will announce a formal AI partnership around Gemini that will finally cement a real AI strategy for Cupertino,\" Ives said. \"This will ultimately be a subscription service launched in the Apple network and lead to Apple achieving a $5 trillion market cap in 2026.\"\nNebius to be acquired\nAI infrastructure provider Nebius may be one of the next big winners of the AI arms race. The Dutch company is Ives' top pick to be acquired by a Big Tech hyperscaler in 2026. He named Microsoft , Alphabet and Amazon as likely candidates to swoop in and buy it.\nNebius stock is coming off an extremely strong 2025, with 212% year-to-date gains. Ives isn't the only pro who sees it as a likely winner. Market research firm Futurum Group named it among its picks for the top tech stocks for the next generation of AI.\nCybersecurity stocks will surge\nIves is also highly bullish on the cybersecurity industry, touting it as one of the tech market's highest performing subsectors. He named CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks as Wedbush's top picks in the space for the coming year.\nWhile Palo Alto Networks has struggled recently and is only up 2% year-to-date, CrowdStrike has spent the year trending upward with 41% gains. Cybersecurity industry experts have also flagged both stocks as likely winners set to capitalize on rising security demand.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Breaking Down Oracle, the AI Trade, and the Outlook for Tech Earnings\n\nSheraz Mian\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:39 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nOracle’s ORCL relationship with OpenAI has become a never-ending source of market angst, as the tie-in reminds many of questionable vendor-financing practices from the late 1990s. Tied to Oracle’s OpenAI exposure are questions about the company’s financial health and its ability to fund its data center expansion plans.\n\nThe December 10 th quarterly release, which was, at best, mixed, added to Oracle’s woes. Oracle missed consensus revenue and margin expectations and raised its capital expenditure (capex) outlook. The stock’s negative reaction to this quarterly release contrasted with the prior quarterly release in early September, when the stock jumped by more than a third.\nWhen investors typically think of the big Tech players, like Microsoft MSFT or Alphabet GOOGL or even Oracle, they instinctively assume fortress balance sheets and ungodly amounts of operating cash flows. Those assumptions are misplaced in the case of Oracle, as it has been relying lately on the debt markets to fund its ever-rising data center buildout-related capital expenditures.\nOracle’s capex outlay totaled $21.2 billion in fiscal year 2025 (FY ends in May), up from $6.7 billion in FY 2024. The company generated $20.8 billion of free cash flow in FY 2025, meaning it was free cash flow negative for the year. The expectation for the current year (FY 2026) is that Oracle’s $50 billion capex budget is approximately double the amount of operating cash flows it is expected to generate. In fact, Oracle will most likely be free cash flow negative in fiscal year 2027 as well, which means that it will need to tap the debt market to fund its capex budget.\n\nThe chart below provides an overview of Oracle’s debt load and the comparable measure for Microsoft. Long-term debt as a share of the company’s total capital is not the only, nor even the best, measure of balance-sheet leverage, but it is a simple and easily understood indicator of financial flexibility.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWe should keep in mind that Oracle isn’t in any financial distress, as it currently has an ‘investment grade’ credit rating from the rating agencies. That said, its credit rating of BBB (from S&P) is the lowest rung of investment-grade credit rating.\nWe are all familiar with the market’s concerns about the broader ‘AI trade’, which ranges from the ‘bubble narrative’ at one extreme to reasonable questions about the monetization of AI investments at the other.\nThe chart below shows the three-month performance of Oracle shares relative to Alphabet, Microsoft, the Zacks Tech sector, and the S&P 500 index.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe ongoing issues in Oracle shares are not a reflection of those AI concerns, as the chart above clearly shows, but rather a function of the aforementioned OpenAI exposure and concerns about its financial health. We would have seen far more solidarity from Microsoft and Alphabet with Oracle in the above period had the overriding issue been the ‘AI trade’.\n\nOne key performance metric that took center stage in the Oracle story is Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), which reached $523 billion this quarter, up $455 billion from the preceding quarter. For reference, the comparable number for Microsoft reached $392 billion in the company’s latest quarterly report.\nThink of this key performance metric as Oracle’s backlog or future revenues had jumped by an eye-popping $317 billion in the preceding quarter. The bearish narrative on Oracle notes that $300 billion of the preceding quarter’s $317 billion RPO growth was attributable to OpenAI.\nIt is this elevated level of customer concentration risk, coupled with Oracle’s relatively stretched financial health, that has been weighing on the stock lately.\n\nA fair assessment of the evolving Oracle story is that while there is undoubtedly more uncertainty and risk associated with its RPO (or backlog) getting converted into future revenues, particularly say relative to Microsoft or Alphabet, it is nevertheless a key element of the company’s growth profile and its status as a critical player in the emerging AI world.\nIn other words, no one should be under the impression that this is a second coming of Enron or other such dubious characters from our collective past.\nThe chart below provides a 10-year comparison of Oracle valuation relative to Microsoft, using the forward 12-month P/E multiple. As you can see here, Oracle shares broke away from their historically discounted valuation to Microsoft only in May 2025, but have now reversed all of those gains.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis 10-year history shows that Oracle shares have commanded as high as 66% premium (September 2025) to Microsoft share to a 55% discount (November 2020), with a 10-year median of 28% discount. The stock is currently trading at an 18% discount to Microsoft shares (23.6X for Oracle vs. 28.7X for Microsoft).\n\nThe lower discount relative to history makes sense when seen in the context of Oracle’s emerging status as a key player in the emerging AI world. Oracle bulls would likely argue that there is no justification for the ‘new Oracle’ to trade at a discount to Microsoft going forward, notwithstanding its balance sheet vulnerability.\nTech Earnings Outlook The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth outlook for the Zacks Tech sector on a quarterly basis, where we highlight expectations for 2025 Q4 in the context of what the sector achieved in the preceding two quarters and what is expected in the following three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector has been critical to driving aggregate earnings growth for the last 9 quarters (since 2023 Q3), and the above chart shows that it is expected to continue playing that role in the coming periods as well.\nPlease note that the Tech sector has been consistently enjoying positive estimate revisions over the past year, and we saw the same trend at play since the start of 2025 Q4 in October. In fact, had it not been for positive revisions to Tech sector estimates, aggregate Q4 earnings estimates for the S&P 500 index would be modestly down since the start of October.\nThe chart below shows the sector’s earnings growth picture on an annual basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe positive revisions trend that we referenced for the Tech sector in the context of 2025 Q4 earnings estimates is very much in place for full-year 2026 estimates as well, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector is not ordinary; it accounts for nearly a third of S&P 500 earnings, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Outlook for the Mag 7 The Mag 7 group is generally seen as mega-cap Tech players. However, in the Zacks sector classification system, two of the Mag 7 players are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; we place Amazon in the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla in the Zacks Auto sector. Both of these sectors are Zacks innovations, as the ‘official’ Standard & Poor’s industry classification does not have stand-alone sectors for the retail and auto spaces.\nFor 2025 Q4, the Mag 7 group is expected to produce +16.9% earnings growth on +16.4% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the Mag 7 group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the group’s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +16.6%, followed by +18% in 2027.\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26.4% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.6% weight in the index.\n2025 Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Last week’s Oracle earnings report was for the company’s fiscal quarter ending in November, which we and other research organizations count as part of the December-quarter tally. Oracle is hardly alone in this respect, and quarterly results from the likes of FedEx, Nike, Adobe, and others fall in the same category. Through Friday, December 19 th , we have seen such Q4 results from 18 S&P 500 members.\nTotal earnings for these 18 index members are up +32.2% from the same period last year on +9% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates from these companies in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below show the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows current Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&P 500 index in the context of the preceding 4 quarters and the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Q4 Earnings: Tech Expected to Remain Growth Driver\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Why is Google Quietly Funneling Billions Into Bitcoin Miners?\n\nFatima\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:32 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nBTC-USD\n\nIREN\n\nGoogle has quietly become a financial safety net for Bitcoin miners, providing at least $5 billion in credit support to help them pivot into Artificial Intelligence (AI). This isn&#8217;t a direct investment but something much smarter: a guarantee. Stocks of miners making this move, like Cipher and IREN, have surged between 300-500% in 2025 as a result.\n\nWhat Is Really Happening Between Google and Bitcoin Miners? This trend is a direct response to AI’s massive hunger for power, a resource that Bitcoin miners have in abundance. As the AI sector in crypto grows, the demand for this kind of infrastructure is exploding.\nSo, how does it work? Think of Google as a wealthy parent co-signing a lease for their child (the Bitcoin miner). The bank (like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs) sees Google’s guarantee and feels safe enough to lend the money for a big project.\n\nMiners like Hut 8, TeraWulf, and Cipher Mining provide the land and power connections. A data-center operator called Fluidstack signs a long-term lease, and Google financially backs Fluidstack&#8217;s obligations. This clever structure turns a volatile crypto company into a bank-friendly infrastructure project.\nVisiting TeraWulf&#8217;s Lake Mariner site makes it clear: this AI pivot isn&#8217;t just software. HPC clusters need liquid-to-chip cooling, far beyond standard Bitcoin air-cooling, which is why build-out costs are so high.\nIt&#8217;s important to note that Google isn&#8217;t handing out this credit for free. In exchange for backing these deals, the company has taken equity warrants in the miners, about 14% in TeraWulf and 5.4% in Cipher. This effectively makes the guarantee a cost of capital, aligning Google&#8217;s upside with the miners&#8217; success while ensuring the tech giant benefits if these AI pivots pay off.\n\nDISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2025\nWhy This Signals a Major Shift for Crypto This is a huge vote of confidence. For years, banks viewed Bitcoin miners as too risky to finance. Their income depends on Bitcoin&#8217;s wild price swings and the ever-increasing difficulty of mining.\nNow, Google’s backing transforms them into stable, predictable businesses in the eyes of Wall Street. According to Yahoo Finance, this pivot is allowing miners to secure revenue streams that are far more reliable than mining alone. With the average cost to produce one Bitcoin nearing $75,000, finding a stable income is a top priority.\nThis signals a new wave of institutional Bitcoin demand , not for the coin itself, but for the powerful infrastructure that supports the network. It legitimizes the entire industry, connecting it directly to the biggest technology story of the decade: AI.\n\nStory Continues\nDISCOVER: 10+ Next Crypto to 100X In 2025\nWhat Are the Hidden Risks for Investors? While the opportunity is clear, it comes with serious strings attached. Bitcoin miners have always operated in a world of “best-effort” power. If something goes down, it&#8217;s a missed opportunity. AI clients, however, demand near-perfect uptime and reliability.\nThis transition requires a complete overhaul of a miner&#8217;s operations and culture. Failure to meet strict service agreements could lead to contract breaches, not just lost revenue. A Reuters report on Bitfarms highlights these operational hurdles as a key challenge.\n\nFurthermore, the entire deal structure relies on the intermediary, Fluidstack, and Google’s long-term commitment. If the AI boom cools or contracts are renegotiated, miners are left exposed. They are betting that Google will remain the ultimate backstop for over a decade.\nThis convergence of crypto and AI is a powerful narrative, marking the start of a potential institutional crypto supercycle. It redefines what a mining company can be, shifting from pure-play crypto exposure to a core infrastructure provider for the future of technology, including further institutional blockchain adoption. This evolution could be the key to their long-term survival and growth.\nDISCOVER: 9+ Best High-Risk, High-Reward Crypto to Buy in 2025\nRead original story Why is Google Quietly Funneling Billions Into Bitcoin Miners? by Peter O'Neill at 99bitcoins.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "RTO mandates to AI agents: How work is changing in 2026 and beyond\n\nRob Lenihan\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:29 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThere are so many songs about work that even Google can’t give you an exact number.\nThere must be thousands of tunes about the daily grind, such as Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5,” the Bangles’ “Manic Monday,” Loverboy’s “Working for the Weekend,” and Johnny Paycheck’s “Take this Job and Shove It.”\nAbout the only ones who seemed to enjoy singing about their careers were the Seven Dwarfs who heigh-hoed off to work in Snow White —and they were cartoon characters.\n\nThe workplace has changed dramatically over the years, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down offices as people worked from home and telecommuted using Zoom and other digital conferencing tools.\nLooking ahead, analysts see even more changes coming to the workplace, where the average person spends roughly one-third of their life.\nReturn-to-office calls got noticeably louder in 2025, Robert Half said, with many large employers rolling out firmer in-office expectations and enforcement—Amazon ( AMZN ), Dell ( DELL ), Walmart ( WMT ), and Starbucks ( SBUX ) were among the major employers to issue RTO mandates.\nAt the same time, the staffing firm said, data indicated that for remote-capable roles, “hybrid work arrangements remained the dominant model—and employee preferences barely budged toward fully on-site work.”\n\n“In general, companies that treated work flexibility as a strategic tool for employee engagement saw better outcomes than those focused on badge counts,” Robert Half said.\nRelated: What is coffee badging? The hybrid work buzzword explained\n“Expect to see fewer performative mandates and more structured models for flexible work guided by what the data shows about employee productivity, satisfaction and retention.”\nThe firm noted that one of the most significant 2025 workplace trends was businesses of all sizes leaning more heavily on contract and interim talent to keep projects moving and access hard-to-find skills.\nAnalysts see rise of AI agents In 2026, the move toward scalable staffing will become a long-term strategy for how work gets done in many companies, Robert Half said, as “economic uncertainty, evolving regulations, AI and tech upgrades, and ongoing project backlogs make it harder to rely on permanent headcount alone.”\nArtificial intelligence will play a bigger role in the workplace, but McKinsey analysts believe that 2026 will be the year of agentic AI, which operates with autonomy with minimal human oversight—unlike traditional AI, which requires step-by-step guidance.\nMore on jobs:\nGoldman Sachs makes unemployment prediction\nHow Work Conditions Impact Mental Health\nNovember BLS jobs data show the good, bad, and ugly, analysts say\nCooling jobs report resets Fed interest-rate cut bet\n\nStory Continues\n“As we move into 2026, companies have the opportunity to advance beyond incremental gains from copilots, chatbots, and other reactive, gen AI–based tools,” the firm said in a recent report. “The best are acting now to transform workflows, functions, and, ultimately, their entire organizations by onboarding AI agents to work side by side with their people.”\n\nAI will not make most human skills obsolete, but it will change how they are used, McKinsey said, “with AI handling more common tasks, people will apply their skills in new contexts.”\nAnalysts at PwC believe that AI could soon end a shift that has marked most of the industrial era—the ever-increasing specialization of work.\n“Agents can increasingly do the specialized tasks that fill the workdays of experienced, mid-tier employees,” the accounting and auditing firm said. “In IT, for example, you may no longer need coders specialized in specific languages. Instead, you may want engineers who understand both tech architecture and how to manage and oversee the agents that do know these languages.”\nIn finance, PwC said that as agents do tasks like invoice processing, purchase order matching, reconciliation, and anomaly detection, “people with general finance skills can focus on growing revenue and expanding margins, engaging with vendors on payment terms, working with sales on dynamic pricing models, and conducting more scenario planning.”\n\n“In knowledge work, many of these roles can be filled by entry-level employees who tend to be AI savvy,” the firm said.\nSurvey: Employees value workplace culture There will be challenges, however, with Deloitte noting that “most enterprises today simply aren’t set up to take advantage of the opportunities for automation that agents present.”\n“However, we’re starting to see signs at leading organizations that these challenges can be surmounted through strategic process redesign, architectural modernization, and new governance frameworks,” the firm said.\n\nRelated: Quantum computing making big leap, analysts say\nHow do employees feel about work?\nWell, 60% of those responding to the 2025 EY US Generation Survey said culture is a major factor in their decision to stay in their jobs.\n“US workers may be feeling the strain of a slow job market, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and economic uncertainty, but when it comes to their priorities, workplace culture is at the top of the list,” the firm said.\nThe most important aspect of workplace culture is the way people interact, according to the survey of 5,000 US white-collar workers at organizations with 5,000 employees or more.\nNearly 30%—the single biggest response—reported that the most valuable aspect of company culture is “how people treat each other,” beating out leadership and management style, work environment, seeing the company’s values in action, or feeling the company prioritizes their career growth.\n\n“The US workplace continues to evolve,” Leslie Patterson, EY Americas and US Inclusiveness Leader, said in a statement. “Gen Z and millennials, in particular, are driving change, but all generations are looking beyond compensation and prioritizing relationships, connections and values.”\n“Many organizations are focused on AI and other emerging technologies that are critical to a competitive advantage,” Patterson added. “But they should also keep their people front and center and look for ways to address the needs of all generations.”\nRelated: Movies struggle for place in changing entertainment market\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 19, 2025, where it first appeared in the Employment section.

      "Content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW): Evaluating Valuation After New Multibillion-Dollar AI Security Deal With Google Cloud\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: PANW\n\nGOOG\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) just doubled down on AI security by striking a multibillion-dollar expansion of its Google Cloud partnership to hardwire its Prisma AIRS platform into Google’s core AI and infrastructure stack.\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks.\nThe stock has been choppy recently, with the 30 day share price return down 7.0 percent and the 1 year total shareholder return roughly flat. However, a 3 year total shareholder return above 160 percent shows longer term momentum is still intact.\n\nIf this AI security deal has you thinking bigger about the space, it is a good moment to scan high growth tech and AI stocks for other potential winners riding similar trends.\nAnalysts still see meaningful upside from today’s price, with PANW trading at a double digit discount to both consensus targets and some intrinsic value estimates. But after a big multiyear run, is this a fresh entry point, or is the market already baking in Palo Alto’s next leg of AI driven growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 17.2% Undervalued With Palo Alto Networks closing at $185.88 against a narrative fair value near the mid $220s, the story frames today’s price as leaving notable upside on the table.\nEnhanced operating efficiencies from scale, a higher mix of software sales, prudent cost controls, and a strong deferred payments portfolio have already led to expanding operating margins (now above 30%) and high free cash flow margins (38%+ with structural visibility to 40%+), directly benefiting future earnings, free cash flow, and shareholder returns.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how double digit growth, rising margins, and a triple digit future earnings multiple can still argue for upside? The underlying projections may surprise you.\nResult: Fair Value of $224.53 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, heavy integration demands from ongoing acquisitions and intensifying AI security competition could challenge Palo Alto’s growth assumptions and put pressure on its premium valuation.\nFind out about the key risks to this Palo Alto Networks narrative.\nAnother Lens on Valuation Not everyone sees upside. On a price to earnings basis, Palo Alto Networks trades at about 116 times earnings, versus 31 times for the US software industry and 44 times for peers, while our fair ratio sits near 43. This gap signals real de rating risk if growth wobbles.\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own Palo Alto Networks Narrative If you see the numbers differently or want to stress test your own thesis, you can craft a personalized view in just a few minutes: Do it your way .\n\nStory Continues\nA great starting point for your Palo Alto Networks research is our analysis highlighting 3 key rewards and 2 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\nLooking for more investment ideas?

The company has added new verification labels to its Gemini app that let people check if a video was created or edited using Google's AI tools.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe idea is simple and hands on. Users can upload a video into Gemini and ask a direct question like whether it was generated with Google AI. Gemini then scans the video for hidden watermarks embedded in both the audio and visuals. These markers are invisible to the human eye and ear, but they allow Gemini to identify which parts of a video include AI generated content.\nAlphabet said the feature supports videos up to 100 MB and 90 seconds long and is now available globally across all languages where Gemini operates. Image verification is also included.\nThe timing matters. As AI generated video becomes more convincing, spotting what is authentic is getting harder. Alphabet's move is less about flashy features and more about trust. By building verification directly into Gemini, Google is giving users a clearer way to slow misinformation and better understand what they are actually watching.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Here's 1 Reason Why.\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet's ability to grow earnings at a double-digit pace will drive the share price higher over time.\nManagement is focused on leveraging AI capabilities to support customers and users, which will help increase ad sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is ready to close out 2025 with a bang. The dominant internet business has seen its shares skyrocket 62% so far this year (as of Dec. 16), thanks to robust financial results and a leading position in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\nThis top tech stock has historically been a great investment. And I predict that it will soar over the next five years. Here's one reason why.\nHigher earnings can propel shares through the rest of the decade Benjamin Graham famously suggested that over the long term, the market is a weighing machine, as fundamentals run the show. Along the same vein, Alphabet shares will be lifted by much higher profits in 2030.\nIn the past five years, the company's net income climbed at a compound annual rate of 26%. Wall Street consensus estimates call for earnings per share to rise at a yearly clip of 17% between 2024 and 2027. I expect double-digit gains to continue past that forecast period.\n\nTherefore, it wouldn't be surprising at all to see Alphabet's stock price double by the end of the decade.\nDigital ad growth will be a key factor Alphabet's bread and butter continues to be its digital ad efforts, representing almost 75% of its revenue base. With the business leveraging AI tools not only to improve customers' ad targeting capabilities, but to bolster its various user-facing products and services, Alphabet is in a favorable position.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $506,935 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,067,514 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 958 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 192% for the S&P 500.

I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could the ‘Full House’ Family Afford San Francisco in 2025?\n\nLaura Beck\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:06 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThe “Full House” Tanner family lived in a gorgeous Victorian house in San Francisco with three kids, three adults and somehow made it work on the salaries of a TV host, a struggling musician and a stand-up comedian. That setup worked great for a sitcom in the 1980s and ’90s, but the math gets brutal when you apply 2025 San Francisco economics to their situation.\n\nThe question isn’t whether they’d struggle. It’s whether they could afford to live there at all without someone secretly being a millionaire. (One of them might be — after all, they lived in San Francisco! Maybe Uncle Jesse wrote a jingle for Google?) Here’s a look at how their finances measure up to the cost of living .\nSan Francisco’s Cost of Living Hits Hard A family of four needs roughly $127,000 yearly to cover basic expenses in San Francisco. That’s just baseline living, not comfortable existence with savings and extras .\nFor what researchers call a modest but adequate standard of living including housing, food, child care, transportation, healthcare and taxes, a two-parent two-child family needs approximately $181,277 yearly. The central “Full House” crew had six people, which pushes costs even higher.\n\nMedian rent tells part of the story. A one-bedroom apartment averages $3,019 monthly while a two-bedroom runs $3,579. The Tanners would need at minimum a three-bedroom, realistically a four-bedroom. That’s easily $5,000 to $7,000 monthly just for rent in a standard apartment, not a Victorian house.\nFind Out: Could Homer Simpson Support His Family in 2025?\nRead Next: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\nWhat the Characters Actually Earned Danny Tanner worked as a morning TV host on “Wake Up San Francisco.” Comparably says this job will bring in the average salary of about $60,202. Although the average in San Jose, California, which is near San Francisco is $118,862. (And it’s good to note that there is a range that goes up to $276,379, and we don’t know how popular Danny or the show are.)\n\nAs a working musician (band member/jingle-writer), the typical U.S. musician like Uncle Jesse earns about $43,790 a year. If he supplemented that with radio/announcing work, median pay for “broadcast announcers/radio DJs” is about US $21.96/hour, but the work tends to be irregular. Maybe he also supplements this writing jingles, which might bring in an extra $10,000 a year, with some years bringing in more, and some years bringing in less.\nAs a (non-celebrity) comedian, Uncle Joey would maybe make $57,392 a year. He might supplement that with sporadic voice acting gigs, so that could be an extra windfall of $5,000 a year, but sometimes maybe more or less.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Combined Household Math Adding the three adult incomes together gives a household range of about $180,000 to $250,000 annually. That sounds like a lot of money until you remember they lived in San Francisco.\nThe actual “Full House” Victorian house sold in 2025 for over $6 million. A mortgage on a $6 million house with 20% down would run approximately $35,000 monthly before property taxes and insurance. Add those costs and you’re looking at $40,000 to $45,000 monthly or roughly $480,000 to $540,000 annually just for housing.\n\nZillow says if you wanted to rent that very same Victorian, it would cost $8,290 a month. At the low end that’s $100,000 yearly just for rent before any other expenses.\nThe Reality Check The combined household income of $180,000 to $250,000 can’t support housing costs of $120,000 to $480,000 annually while also covering food, child care, transportation, healthcare and everything else for six people. The math doesn’t work unless someone inherited the house mortgage-free or bought it decades earlier when prices were drastically lower.\n\nAnalysis of TV characters’ housing affordability confirmed that the “Full House” family’s income couldn’t realistically support their housing costs. The show never addressed this gap, which is fine because it’s fiction and the house functioned as a character itself.\nHow They Could Make It Work The Tanner family could afford San Francisco in 2025 only under specific conditions. Danny would need to be a top-tier TV personality earning $250,000 or more. Jesse would need consistent high-paying jingle contracts or a successful music career bringing in $120,000 plus. Joey would need major voice acting gigs generating $100,000 annually. Even then they’d need to rent a standard apartment, not a Victorian mansion.\n\nThe more realistic scenario involves downsizing dramatically to a three-bedroom apartment, running an extremely tight budget , sacrificing savings and extras and still feeling financially stretched.

      "Content": "AI hyperscalers have room for ‘elevated debt issuance’ — even after their recent bond binge, BofA says\n\nJason Ma\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BAC\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThe tech giants fueling the AI boom generate so much cash relative to their debt that they have more than enough room to issue more, according to Bank of America .\nIn a note this week, analysts looked at the top five publicly traded AI hyperscalers: Meta , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Oracle .\nBofA pointed out that while the companies can fund their near-term capital expenditures with cash, they are tapping debt markets for balance-sheet flexibility and better cost of capital. Last month alone, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon raised tens of billions of dollars in the bond market.\n\nOperating cash flow for the big five hyperscalers is expected to hit $577 billion this year from $378 billion in 2023, while debt should climb from $356 billion to $433 billion.\nThat means their overall debt burden is actually getting lighter as the debt-to-cash ratio should dip from 0.94 to 0.75.\n“Given the hyperscalers’ historically conservative capital allocation and balance sheet policies, elevated debt issuance is possible, as evident by the recent bond deals from Meta, Alphabet and Amazon,” BofA said.\nAnd plenty of additional cash is on the way. By 2029, operating cash flow is seen jumping 95% to $1.1 trillion, while capex is forecast to grow at a much slower pace of 58% to $632 billion.\nBut then there’s Oracle. Unlike the other AI hyperscalers, it will have negative free cash flow until 2029, meaning its capex will exceed cash from operations, according to BofA. As a result, it doesn’t have much capacity to take on more debt.\n\nIndeed, fears about Oracle’s debt binge have rattled the overall AI stock trade as the company isn’t a cash machine like its AI peers.\nRecent earnings guidance was also weak, and the company raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 capex by another $15 billion. In addition, surging lease obligations have spooked Wall Street.\nA Financial Times report on Wednesday that said alternative investments firm Blue Owl didn’t team up with Oracle on a data center after all piled on more concerns. Shares fell on the news, though the company’s development partner, Related Digital, said Blue Owl was outbid on the project and didn’t back out of it.\nBut even though debt may not pose a limit on hyperscalers’ ambitions, they still face physical limits , namely in building enough infrastructure fast enough to meet demand.\nData-center researcher Jonathan Koomey told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg that capital can be deployed instantly, but the equipment that capital must buy cannot. Tmelines for turbines, transformers, specialized cooling systems, and high-voltage gear have stretched into years, he explained.\n\nStory Continues\n“This happens every time there’s a massive shift in investment,” Koomey added. “Eventually manufacturers catch up, but not right away. Reality intervenes.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The all-stock deal values each TAE share at $53.89, though TAE is privately held, leaving the precise valuation of its equity portion unclear. Trump Media, which has a market capitalization of around $2.9 billion, plans to provide $200 million in cash at closing, which the companies expect to occur in mid-2026, with ownership of the combined entity split roughly evenly.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DJT.\nIs DJT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nExecutives said the combination brings together Trump Media's access to capital and TAE's fusion technology to pursue long-term energy solutions for AI-driven infrastructure. The merged company expects to begin construction next year on a 50-megawatt utility-scale fusion power plant, subject to regulatory approvals, and is targeting first power generation in 2031. Management also outlined ambitions to develop additional fusion facilities capable of generating between 350 and 500 megawatts each, while acknowledging that fusion is not yet commercially viable and continues to face significant scientific and engineering hurdles.\n\nThe deal would be led by co-CEOs Devin Nunes and TAE founder Michl Binderbauer, with Donald Trump Jr. joining a nine-member board, as executives pointed to the goal of creating the first publicly traded nuclear fusion company in the U.S. Founded in 1998, TAE is among the world's oldest private fusion ventures and counts Alphabet, Chevron, Goldman Sachs, and several prominent family offices among its backers. The agreement comes amid surging AI-related electricity demand and increased policy focus on energy infrastructure, including a national energy emergency declaration and executive orders aimed at accelerating data-center and power development, trends that could keep fusion in focus as a potential long-term solution.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAs is the case with other technology giants, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has positioned itself to be a key player in the AI race. The firm differs from players such as Google and Amazon through the fact that it does not operate a cloud computing business.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a key player in the AI industry due to several factors. These include the firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its in-house Trainium AI chips. The highly competitive cloud computing industry, which sees investors demand high growth rates, has also affected Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2025. As an example, the shares dipped in August after the firm’s second-quarter earnings saw AWS post a 17.5% revenue growth, which was slower than Microsoft and Google’s cloud growth rates of 39% and 32%, respectively.\nZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.com\nAWS has also been the focus of recent analyst coverage for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s shares. For instance, Guggenheim initiated coverage on December 10th as it set a Buy rating and a $300 share price target. The research firm cited AWS as the reason behind its coverage and shared that the business’s 3.8-year backlog had touched $200 billion in Q2. Cramer also discussed the AWS business. He insisted that the cloud business will drive the narrative, and commented on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) after BMO Capital raised the share price target to $304 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating, and raised the Q1 2026 AWS cloud growth estimate to 24% from an earlier 23%.

Alphabet: Which Could Be The World's Biggest Company By End-2026?\n\nPiero Cingari\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trails with a 14% chance, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) at 9%.\nTesla Inc . (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits , suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google , OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data.

      "Content": "Buffett Leaving Berkshire Creates a ‘Vacuum Risk’ and a $381 Billion Question\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:18 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nBA\n\nBRK-B\n\nGOOG\n\nQuick Read Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) is underperforming the S&P 500 in a rare break from a two-decade trend as Warren Buffett prepares to step down as CEO.\nThe departure of Todd Combs to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) raises concerns about future stock selection and internal investment leadership.\nBerkshire’s $341 billion cash position reflects valuation discipline, but investors are increasingly focused on how effectively the next generation will deploy capital.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video I started the discussion by acknowledging something that feels almost unnatural for long-time Berkshire watchers. Warren Buffett is struggling, at least by his own historic standards. With Buffett expected to step away from the CEO role within weeks, Lee and I agreed that the timing of recent events has only amplified investor anxiety.\n\nA rare break from long-term outperformance Lee reminded me that we have covered Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway for nearly 20 years, and since 2000 the company has outperformed the S&P 500 almost every single year. That streak is coming to an end. The stock has gone through a rocky period, and that kind of volatility is not what investors associate with Buffett’s steady hand. Once Buffett publicly committed to stepping aside, the margin for error narrowed, and the market has become far less forgiving.\n\nTodd Combs and the vacuum risk The most troubling development we discussed was the departure of Todd Combs. As one of Buffett’s two key proteges, Combs played a central role in portfolio management and in supporting Greg Abel, the executive expected to lead Berkshire going forward. When Combs left to take a role at JPMorgan Chase, it immediately raised a hard question. Who finds the next great ideas?\n\nLee pointed out that Combs or his investment cohort were likely behind Berkshire’s position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Even though Buffett was late to that trade, it remains one of Berkshire’s most strategically important modern holdings. The concern now is whether there is another investor inside Berkshire capable of sourcing similar opportunities in a market that is far more complex than it was twenty years ago.\nSelling stocks and stockpiling cash Another focal point of our conversation was Berkshire’s enormous cash hoard, now roughly $341 billion. I argued that this is not a sign of confusion, but discipline. Berkshire’s cash balance will likely continue to grow until markets correct and valuations become more attractive. Whether Buffett himself or his successors pull the trigger, there are clearly stocks the team likes. They just do not like them at current prices.\n\nStory Continues\nLee agreed, noting that patience has always been core to Berkshire’s DNA. The difference now is that investors are watching closely to see whether that patience translates into decisive action once opportunity appears.\nWhat might come next Lee brought up Boeing (NYSE: BA) as a potential example of the type of company Berkshire could target. After years of turmoil following the 737 Max crashes and operational failures, Boeing has begun to stabilize and has secured large new orders. Historically, Berkshire has favored exactly these kinds of battered but essential companies that are likely to survive and recover.\n\nCore holdings still dominate We closed by looking at the current portfolio. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains Berkshire’s largest holding by a wide margin, even after substantial trimming. The same is true for Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) , which has also been reduced significantly. How aggressively the next leadership team continues to reshape these positions will say a lot about Berkshire’s future identity.\n\nFor now, Berkshire sits at an inflection point. Underperformance, executive departures, and a looming leadership transition have unsettled even its most loyal shareholders. Whether that uncertainty creates an opportunity or signals a longer adjustment period will depend on how effectively the post-Buffett team proves it can do what Buffett did better than anyone else.\nTranscript: [00:00:00] Lee Jackson: Now let's talk about Tom Combs leaving and how it's underperformed, et cetera.\n[00:00:06] Doug McIntyre: Warren Buffett has been having a tough time now. He'll be retiring, I think in about three weeks. But yeah, he's\n[00:00:12] Lee Jackson: pretty much out the door from\n\n[00:00:13] Doug McIntyre: the CEO slot. Since he said he was gonna leave, he's had some real problems.\n[00:00:19] Part of it is departures of senior people, but the other one is the stock has been, it's been a rocky period for the stock, which, it's not traditional for him.\n[00:00:31] Lee Jackson: No, because we had done some work on this 'cause we've covered Buffett and Berkshire for almost 20 years here at 24/7. And, literally since 2000, he outperformed the s and p 500 almost every year, if not every year.\n[00:00:47] That ain't gonna be the case this year. And yeah, I think, It's not surprising when people leave. Just ask Old Miss. But, when, somebody like Todd Combs walks out the door, he was one of the two, Buffett proteges, that were helping him with the portfolio, helping the guy that's stepping in to be the new CEO, he was, they were the guys that were helping him.\n\n[00:01:14] When Todd takes a, job at JP Morgan to do. Some investment strategy stuff. I'm, I don't really remember exactly what he's gonna do there, but a, he must have got a huge paycheck to go there, and he's probably filthy rich anyway, because he is been at Berkshire for years. But that's not a good sign for Berkshire.\n[00:01:33] That's not a good sign because who's gonna be the stock pickers? who's gonna find the new ideas? And I think you know, it, was probably him or his, cohort that suggested Google. Even though, Buffett was late to the Google purchase, it's in there. And as, as you've said a lot, and it's been your favorite big name, is there gonna be somebody to find more good ideas like that?\n\n[00:02:00] Because all they've been doing is selling for the last couple of years, and they have that huge pile of cash, like 341 billion of cash. So. Do you think that, I think some investors, especially longtime investors, are concerned that is every anybody else gonna go, the other people gonna\n[00:02:20] Doug McIntyre: leave. Well, there's a second part about this and that is everybody talks about the cash.\n[00:02:25] The cash on that balance is going to grow until the market drops. Right. It may not be Buffett, it may be as proteges, but there are a bunch of people sitting there who love some stocks and they're waiting for them to get to the point where they think that they're a good buy. Yeah. They love the stocks.\n[00:02:43] They love them now, but they don't love 'em at these prices.\n\n[00:02:48] Lee Jackson: Yeah. I agree. And it's funny, I. there was an upgrade for Boeing, and Boeing's gotten some huge orders and it's been a nightmare over the last five years, the 737 max crashes and, all of that stuff, and it's gonna probably be a name like Boeing or, maybe some other company that's been beaten down hard, but, will survive and exist.\n[00:03:10] But yeah, it's gonna be interesting how. The portfolio evolves going forward. 'cause a, apple is still the biggest position by far. Yeah. But you know, they've sold a ton of that. They sold a ton of Bank of America and it'll be interesting to see how things go and it'll be interesting to see if investors start to buy a lower Berkshire or continue to sell it.\n\n[00:03:35] Doug McIntyre: Yeah\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "The AI Data Center Reality Check, Oracle Stumbles and China Looms Over US Valuations\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:16 AM PST 13 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nQuick Read Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) missed revenue expectations and pushed out key data center timelines to 2028, triggering a broad reassessment of near-term AI infrastructure returns.\nMassive capital requirements, power constraints, and transformer shortages suggest AI monetization will lag investment by several years, raising return-on-equity concerns across the sector.\nChina’s ability to rapidly deploy energy and data center capacity could pressure US AI valuations as competition shifts from software innovation to infrastructure scale.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video Our conversation began with a simple observation. A lot has happened in AI over the past week, and not all of it has been good. Lee opened by pointing directly at Oracle’s earnings report, which on its own would have looked solid for most technology companies. The problem, as we both agreed, is that Oracle is no longer being valued like most tech companies. It is being valued as a core pillar of the AI data center buildout.\n\nWhen Oracle failed to meet revenue expectations and suggested that large-scale data centers may not be ready until 2028, it immediately chilled sentiment across the entire sector. On the same day the Dow pushed to new highs, the Nasdaq was hit hard, with anything even loosely tied to AI selling off aggressively. That divergence told us the market was reassessing the timeline, not the technology.\nWhy the data center story moved too fast I argued that there are two realities investors are only now starting to price in. First, most AI companies are realizing they are not going to make meaningful money for several years. They will need to invest hundreds of billions of dollars before returns show up, even if some of that capital comes from private equity or bank financing. Second, building data centers is slow, politically complicated, and infrastructure-heavy.\n\nLee and I discussed the growing resistance to data centers at the local level. Water usage, electricity consumption, and rising power rates are becoming flashpoints. A single large data center can consume as much electricity as an entire country like Luxembourg. That kind of demand requires massive upgrades to grids, transformers, and transmission systems, many of which already face shortages and multi-year lead times.\nThe myth of rapid AI saturation We both pushed back on the idea that the world could be blanketed with AI data centers in a year or two. Even with unlimited money, it simply is not possible. Transformers alone can take years to source and deploy. These bottlenecks mean that the AI revolution, while real, will unfold far more slowly than early bulls assumed.\n\nStory Continues\nLee noted that AI enthusiasm has been building for roughly three years, dating back to OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022. The narrative focused almost entirely on how AI would change everything, and we both believe it will. But as history shows, transformative technologies also produce waves of failed companies. Just as many internet pioneers disappeared after the dot-com boom, AI is likely to see a significant thinning of the herd within the next two to three years.\n\nValuations and the coming shakeout I said bluntly that two years from now there will be blood in the streets. Competition is intensifying rapidly. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is already catching up in key areas, and new models from Anthropic and others continue to enter the field. OpenAI is not going out of business, but whether it ultimately justifies valuations approaching $500 billion remains an open question.\n\nThe China factor investors underestimate One of the most important risks we discussed is China. Lee referenced recent reporting highlighting China’s ability to deploy power infrastructure at extraordinary speed. Solar arrays, nuclear plants, and effectively unlimited electricity give China a structural advantage in scaling AI data centers. I emphasized that great technology alone is not enough. If China can build data centers in every region without regulatory friction, US AI valuations could face serious pressure from overseas competition, not just from domestic rivals.\n\nWhat investors should do now Lee made the point that companies like Google and Oracle will survive, but the return on the staggering amounts already invested will take time. I agreed and offered practical advice. If an investor has tripled their money in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , they should take some profits. Half is a perfectly reasonable number. Markets have a long history of sharp corrections that erase gains faster than people expect.\n\nWe also touched on utilities and even speculative ideas like space-based solar power, but the conclusion was straightforward. AI is real, transformative, and here to stay. The timeline, however, is longer, more expensive, and more competitive than the market originally priced in. For investors sitting on large gains, caution and discipline matter more now than enthusiasm.\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: So, Lee, we've had a whole bunch of stuff go on in the world of AI in the last week, and not all of it’s been good. We have some of these weeks where everything is good. What's happened in the last week or so that's really not as good?\n[00:00:19] Lee Jackson: Well, I think the most dynamic thing is, and it has really kind of pushed the whole sector down, and we're on, we're talking on Friday, in the week when Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) still posted, by most tech companies’ standards, strong numbers. Oh God. Yeah. They were great. It would've been really, really good.\n\n[00:00:38] But Oracle is not most tech companies, and they were basically, people are starting to think that they didn't hit the revenue numbers and now they've pushed out the data center readiness to 2028. Uh-oh. That's not what everybody had on their scorecard.\n[00:00:57] So I think it has really put a chill in the whole sector, and as today you can see, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average streams to new highs, the NASDAQ just gets absolutely hammered. Everything that's even related to the industry is getting hammered. So I think it's kind of, I guess the question is, is this just\n[00:01:21] a hiccup in the bigger AI story, which I'm sure the real big AI bulls would say, or, is maybe the whole AI data center universe moving a little too fast?\n\n[00:01:36] Doug McIntyre: I think there are two parts to it. Number one: I'm pretty sure most of these companies are starting to look at themselves and say, I'm not gonna make any real money on this for a couple of years.\n[00:01:49] I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to invest literally hundreds of billions of dollars. I may get some of that from private equity or banks, so I may not be playing with my own money. The other thing is, and I want to stress this, it takes a long time to build a data center, and there are a lot of hurdles.\n[00:02:08] One hurdle now is a lot of people don't want data centers near where they live because of the water usage. But more importantly, it's only natural: if a data center uses as much electricity as basically the entire country, the entire town or the country of Luxembourg, right? Exactly.\n\n[00:02:31] People say to themselves, how can my rates not go up? Right. And it's, you've gotta build that infrastructure. Things like transformers, which people say, oh, who cares, you need transformers to do this work. There is a shortage of transformers right now. Right, right. The lead time on building those transformers is a year or two, maybe.\n[00:02:57] Yeah. So the whole idea that you're gonna have the world plastered with data centers in a year or two, it's not true. Even if all the money were available, it's not gonna happen.\n[00:03:09] Lee Jackson: Yeah, I don't think it will either. And it was interesting, some of the people that were so bullish at the outset, and remember this has been rolling for like three years.\n\n[00:03:22] OpenAI introduced Chat in, like, November of 2022. Yeah, so it's been rolling for three years. But again, it was rolling mostly on the idea of how AI will change everything. And it will be a profound change. It'll be more profound than perhaps the internet was 25 years ago.\n[00:03:44] But it's gonna take a lot of work. And as you and I both know, because we've been in the business so long, there were a lot of promising companies back then that are gone. Where's Netscape? Some of the other big names from 20 years ago? They're not around. There's competition in that range, but I think there's gonna be a real thinning of the herd in the next two to three years, certainly within two years, next year in 2027. I think there’ll be a big thinning of the herd and we’ll be looking at some different companies.\n\n[00:04:17] Doug McIntyre: Two years from now, there’s gonna be blood in the streets. Very, very soon. Yeah. I think so. You’re starting to see Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) product catching up with OpenAI. Is OpenAI gonna go outta business? No. No. Is it worth $500 billion? Did the last people who put the money in that final round, are they gonna get their money back?\n[00:04:37] I don't know. You've now got, it's unbelievable technology, but people are getting in too early.\n[00:04:47] Lee Jackson: Yeah. And again, they're all constantly iterating, ChatGPT came out, they have a new version five or whatever, but Gemini’s got a new one and there’s a new Claude from Anthropic.\n[00:04:59] And so, they’re not all gonna make it. They’re not all gonna make it. The question is for the betting man and the investor: who stays and who goes in the next two or three years?\n\n[00:05:10] Doug McIntyre: There’s another problem here. People don't talk enough about, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday about the fact that China has effectively unlimited electricity because of the structure of its system.\n[00:05:20] Yeah, of course. They say that their solar arrays span the mountains and that they build a nuclear plant in less time than it takes to get a permit in the United States, was one of the comments I believe. So we need to worry in the United States, and US companies in AI need to worry, about whether China is in the process of flanking us, because it isn’t just important to have great technology.\n[00:05:49] It’s important if you can have virtually unlimited data centers, I mean a data center in like every village. I'm very worried about that. Unlike a Walmart. I am very worried that the valuations of US artificial intelligence companies are going to be hit by China. Yeah. And not just by competition in the United States.\n\n[00:06:10] Lee Jackson: Yeah, I think you're right. And again, Google, they’ll be around. Oracle, they’ll be around. But I mean, the sheer amount of money they’ve already put into this is staggering. It is staggering. And the return on equity and the return on investment, it’s gonna take a lot of work. It’s gonna take a lot of work.\n[00:06:30] I mean, if I was long all of those kinds of stocks, with the exception of maybe Google, I’d trim some of it. And clearly people have already trimmed some Oracle ’cause it just exploded higher earlier this year. So there was a lot of profit taking there. And I read that Ellison lost $25 billion in like two days, or some staggering number like that.\n[00:06:51] But I wrote that story. Yeah, I wrote that. Okay. Yeah.\n\n[00:06:56] Doug McIntyre: The other thing about AI that I think investors, here's my advice to somebody: if you’ve tripled your money in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , take some off the table. Take half. Half is a great number. Don’t assume it’s gonna keep going up. Lee and I have been around long enough to see at least five or six, and I don’t mean little corrections, I mean real corrections.\n[00:07:23] Yeah. You hit that with Nvidia, it could be gone in five months. So yeah, it,\n[00:07:28] Lee Jackson: it really could. It really could. And when I was a salesman at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, I had people that made big money in Red Hat and all those names that came out then.\n[00:07:41] And I recommended JDS Uniphase, if you remember that company. I had a client that had 250,000 shares of it because he was the first US employee. I told him flat out, I said, sell half. He did, but he kept the rest of it. And it went from a hundred and a quarter to two. So I think Doug’s advice is something to be counted on.\n\n[00:08:02] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. I still like some of the utilities because, yeah, I know these guys talk about owning their own infrastructure. There was a story yesterday that there's a company that’s going to put solar arrays on satellites in outer space and then beam the energy down.\n[00:08:21] Lee Jackson: To the world. I read that too.\n[00:08:23] In fact, I have that in my notes. And I thought that was outstanding, that they can grab power out there. Well, it’s because there’s no clouds.\n[00:08:35] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. The explanation was that they like it because there aren't any clouds. Yeah.\n[00:08:39] Lee Jackson: Aether Flux is the player in space and their satellites will beam solar energy to Earth.\n[00:08:50] Right. Yes. Well, I don't know how they’re gonna do that, but that’s what they said. Don’t hold your breath. Well, anyway, I think on a final note on this, and we’ll get back to utilities soon, is: boy, be careful. And if you’ve got a huge staggering profit, take half, take half, or at least take a third.\n\n[00:09:09] Yep. I agree.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Got $10,000? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in December and Hold for the Long Term\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies in AI infrastructure.\nAlphabet has a major cost advantage over competitors.\nBoth stocks look poised to be long-term AI winners.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIf you've got $10,000 to invest and are looking for some growth stocks to hold for the long term, splitting it between a couple of top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be a good idea. This is a bit of an aggressive strategy, although AI leaders have been leading the market higher for the past few years.\nLet's look at two AI stocks to invest in now for the long term.\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king of AI infrastructure, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the primary chips used to power AI workloads. The company currently commands a more than 90% market share in the GPU space, thanks to the wide moat it has established through the ecosystem it has developed around its chips. This starts with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code was written and optimized for its chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's recent acquisition of SchedMD, which developed an open-source workload manager for AI clusters called Slurm, only helps widen its software moat. Slurm is a software platform that helps determine which GPU is assigned to which tasks and when. By acquiring SchedMD, Nvidia gains control over this important AI orchestration layer, which it can then optimize for its chips and hardware and make for a seamless experience.\nIn addition to software, Nvidia has also created an edge with its networking portfolio. Its proprietary NvLink interconnect system can transfer data between its GPUs much faster than standard PCIe connections. It pools GPU memory and boosts data throughput, essentially letting its GPUs act as one powerful unit. This optimizes large language model (LLM) training and discourages vendor mixing and matching.\n\nAs AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia is one of the companies best positioned to benefit. It has seen rapid growth, but with the AI race still just in the early innings, it has a long runway of growth still in front of it.\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is another company that is positioned to be a huge AI winner. Ironically, the reason for this is that it has been able to break free of being completely reliant on Nvidia. Alphabet has designed its own custom AI chips that are optimized to work in its Tensorflow framework. It has been using these chips to run internal workloads for more than a decade, and they are now in their seventh generation. While other companies have developed their own custom AI chips, none are as far along or as battle-tested as Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's TPUs provide a significant structural cost advantage over both cloud computing competitors and companies developing foundational LLMs, like OpenAI. As a preprogrammed ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), TPUs offer better price-performance and power efficiency, allowing Alphabet to train its Gemini models and run inference for them more cheaply than other models. It also gives its cloud computing business better margins for customers who choose to use its TPUs.\n\nGiven Alphabet's better economics, this creates a virtuous circle, as it allows it to pour more money into its chips and AI models, making them better and more attractive to customers. Alphabet also has the advantage of being able to infuse its constantly improving Gemini model throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Google search to its Android smartphone operating system to its worker productivity tools.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has huge advantages as search and generative AI discovery meld into one. Google is already the default gateway to the internet on most devices, and the company has a long-established history of monetizing search through its vast ad network.

This is the Week in Numbers. :: Week in Numbers :: $6 billion $6 billion was the value of an unusual merger between President Donald Trump's social media company and a nuclear fusion firm. It will see a tie-up between Trump Media and Google-backed TAE Technologies. It came just days after fusion industry leaders asked for more federal funding from the U.S. Energy Department. Peter Loge leads the Project on Ethics in Political Communication at The George Washington University. \"Any time a member of the president's family's name is on a commercial enterprise, it raises ethical questions. Are people buying the thing because the president's name is on it? Are people buying Trump branded products because they think it'll help him get close to the president or that the president will like them more?\" :: 80% Just over 80% of TikTok's U.S. business will be sold to avoid a ban in the country. Chinese owner ByteDance said it had signed a binding agreement with three major investors: Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The deal will build a new U.S. company called TikTok USDS Joint Venture, with ByteDance holding just under a fifth of it. :: 0.75% 0.75% is the new benchmark interest rate in Japan - up from a previous 0.5%. It's the highest number seen in three decades, and the Bank of Japan showed a readiness for further hikes. Policymakers also removed language that growth and price rises will stagnate due to higher U.S. tariffs. Which showed their belief the country is on course to hit its 2% inflation target. :: $19.5 billion $19.5 billion is the writedown taken by Ford as it does a big rethink on electric cars. The auto giant killed several models and said it would pivot to gas and hybrid models. Its move comes after demand for EVs fell in the U.S., where the Trump administration has pulled incentives for buyers. :: $108.4 billion And $108.4 billion was the hostile bid Warner Bros Discovery turned down from Paramount Skydance. Warner's board argued Paramount's offer misled shareholders over its financing. It argued the offer was 'inferior' to a merger agreement it already had in place with Netflix. Whoever wins the bidding war will get hold of popular film franchises like 'Harry Potter' and 'DC Comics'.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Warren Buffett's Last Purchase at Berkshire Hathaway a Top Stock Pick for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Alphabet is a stock Buffett regrets not investing in sooner.\nShares of the tech giant have been on a huge run since Q2 began.\nThe next year continues to look promising for Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nWarren Buffett's time as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) is unfortunately coming to a close. The legendary CEO has provided investors with incredible advice and has made some savvy investments along the way.\n\nDuring the latest round of filing Form 13F s with the SEC, it was revealed that Berkshire took a new stake in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . This shouldn't come as a surprise, as Buffett has long regretted not investing in Alphabet sooner. However, this latest stock pick has already paid off in a big way, as Alphabet's stock has risen dramatically since he took a position.\nThe question is, is it still a great stock pick for 2026?\nBuffett's trades are lagging indicators When a firm has over $100 million in assets, as Berkshire certainly does, it must file a Form 13F to disclose its holdings at the end of the quarter. This information is then made available to the public 45 days later. This means that Berkshire purchased shares of Alphabet between July 1 and Sept. 30, and depending on when they took their positions, Berkshire could be sitting on massive gains.\n\nAlphabet's stock has been on fire since July 1, and if Berkshire bought all of its Alphabet shares on that day (an unlikely proposition), it's about 75% since then. If Berkshire waited until Sept. 30 (another unlikely proposition), it's still up nearly 30%, an outstanding return in a short timeframe.\nBerkshire's Alphabet investment has been successful so far, but the problem for individual investors tracking their trades is that you cannot go back and purchase the stock at the same price that Buffett and Berkshire did. So, investors must consider whether the price to pay now is too steep compared to what Berkshire paid for it.\nAlphabet has a bright future At the start of the period when Berkshire could have bought Alphabet, the stock was trading for just over 16 times forward earnings .\nNow, it's priced at 29 times forward earnings. That's a massive difference, because it used to trade at a huge discount to the market (as measured by the S&P 500 , but now it trades at a large premium (the S&P 500 trades for 22 times forward earnings).\nSo, is Alphabet worth buying now?\n\nAlphabet had a massive run-up in that short timeframe for a few reasons. First, Alphabet received positive news in a court case surrounding the status of its crown jewel, the Google Search engine. Alphabet only had to make a few concessions in its business, which is a far cry from the breakup that the Justice Department was seeking.\n\nStory Continues\nSecond, Alphabet has emerged as a top player in the generative AI realm. It has mounted such a comeback that OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, declared a \"code red\" regarding Alphabet's Gemini model. Alphabet is clearly a top player in this area, and that dominance could make it a strong buy for the future.\n\nAlphabet's legacy businesses, advertising and cloud computing, have also put up respectable growth figures in recent quarters. In the third quarter, Google Search revenue rose 15% year over year, and Google Cloud saw a 34% growth rate. This led to overall growth of 16% for the quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 35%.\nAlphabet is in a great position to have a strong 2026, so I think investors can follow Buffett's lead and scoop up Alphabet. However, your returns won't be nearly the same as Buffett's because of getting in late, versus when Buffett and Berkshire did in the second quarter.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $511,196 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,047,897 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 951 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 192% for the S&P 500.

If history is any guide, stocks will keep pushing higher: Since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, rising 1.3% on average, data compiled by Citadel Securities show.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nWhile longer-term worries about the artificial-intelligence trade linger and valuations remain stretched, optimism over a strong economy and corporate profits is keeping investor sentiment upbeat. Traders are snapping up bullish options on chipmakers and large-cap technology shares, according to Susquehanna International Group, while the retail crowd remains avid buyers of US stocks.\n“Barring any major shocks, it will be hard to fight the overwhelmingly positive seasonal period we are entering and the cleaner positioning set-up,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk team including Gail Hafif wrote in a note to clients. “While we don’t necessarily see a dramatic rally, we do think there is room to go up from here into year end.”\n\nUS stocks bounced back Thursday after a cooler-than-expected — albeit controversial — inflation report bolstered prospects for more interest-rate cuts next year. Technology shares led the advance, with the Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index rising 2% and the Nasdaq 100 Index adding 1.5% after wobbling in the past five days.\nThat’s good news for derivatives traders who spent the last few days buying options wagering on a further rally in technology shares. They scooped up call spreads tied to Nvidia Corp., Micron Technology Inc. and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), while selling puts on megacap names including Alphabet Inc., Nvidia and Broadcom Inc., according to data compiled by Susquehanna.\n“This is a classic expression of confidence that declines will be shallow and temporary,” said Chris Murphy, Susquehanna’s co-head of derivatives strategy. “Investors were using the tech drawdown to increase exposure to AI, semiconductors and long-duration tech, not flee from them.”\n\nStory Continues\nThe broader backdrop for US equities remains constructive as well. Investors have put about $100 billion into US stocks in the past nine weeks, extending a steady trend of inflows seen throughout 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. A gauge of investor sentiment tracked by the firm is sitting at the most bullish level since April.\n\nRetail investors, the stock market’s biggest cheerleaders this year, are showing few signs of losing interest. Individual traders have been net buyers of call options on US stocks for 32 of the past 33 weeks, the longest stretch in Citadel Securities’ data.\n“Following a year of strong portfolio returns and record household wealth, retail participants enter 2026 with both conviction and balance-sheet capacity to increase market participation,” Scott Rubner, head of equity and equity-derivatives strategy at Citadel Securities, wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\nInstitutional investors have become more upbeat on the stock market as well, scooping up calls across the stock market and piling into sectors outside Big Tech in the past few weeks, Rubner added. Economically sensitive real estate and industrials stocks showed the strongest buy signal for a second consecutive week, he said.\n\nSubsiding volatility ahead of a seasonally quiet part of the year is adding another tailwind. The S&P 500’s 10-day realized volatility has dropped to one of its lowest levels of the year, a dynamic that could prompt volatility-targeting and trend-following funds to increase equity exposure.\n“We still think there is room for volatility to compress further,” Goldman’s trading desk wrote. “Lower levels of implied volatility mean more fuel for systematic re-leveraging.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meanwhile, the threat of competition from deep-pocketed heavyweights and upstarts like OpenAI and Anthropic weighed on software makers that are considered most at risk from challengers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nWith the bull market in US stocks stretching into a fourth year, there are more concerns than ever about the sustainability of heavy spending on AI computing and whether the returns will justify the investments.\n“There’s a lot of optimism around AI, but also a lot of hype,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. “2026 will be more about the proof of AI. What’s the ROI on the hyperscalers that have been spending? Will they see profit growth continue to accelerate?”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the biggest stock market stories for the tech industry in 2025 and the outlook for each in the new year.\nNeocloud Nerves\nNeoclouds, which are companies that provide cloud-computing services tailored to AI customers, were the rage for most of 2025. But heading into 2026 they look more like proxies for AI bubble risk.\nGrowing scrutiny over OpenAI’s lack of profitability has raised questions about its ability to pay for its massive spending commitments, including a cloud-computing deal with Oracle Corp. said to be worth $300 billion over five years. Oracle was expected to be a major beneficiary of AI growth, but its stock is down 45% since hitting a peak in September as its exposure to OpenAI becomes a major concern.\n“There is a lot of fear with OpenAI and the commitments it has made,” said Adam Rich, who helps oversee more than $17 billion in assets as deputy chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Vaughan Nelson. “People can only forecast what we know, and right now there’s a lot we don’t know. So long as that’s the case, it will be hard for companies like Oracle to regain their luster.”\n\nStory Continues\nOracle has other issues, including the amount of money it’s spending on data center leases, reported delays in some data center projects, and financing questions. Its growing debt load is particularly concerning to investors, as a measure of the company’s credit risk has skyrocketed to its highest level since the financial crisis.\n\nBeyond Oracle, neocloud provider CoreWeave Inc. has lost about two-thirds of its market value since hitting a high in June. And Nebius Group NV shares are down more than 42% from an October peak.\nBoring Tech\nInvestors discovered new AI trades in 2025 by following where the billions of dollars in pledged capital expenditures are going. You can see it just by looking at the top performers in the S&P 500 Index. Memory and storage company Sandisk Corp. leads the list, followed by Western Digital Corp, which makes hard disk drives, and its rival Seagate Technology Holdings Plc. Micron Technology Inc., the biggest US-based maker of memory chips, is fifth.\nThe trend is expected to continue in 2026 as capital expenditures keep growing. Investors are increasingly thinking about where the next wave is headed, with some eyeing beaten-down software stocks.\n“Things at the edge are interesting,” said Melissa Otto, who heads technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “There is this AI ecosystem that orbits around the AI infrastructure itself.”\n\nSoftware Slump\nSoftware stocks traded at attractive market valuations in 2025, but that did little to entice investors. Shares of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies were hit particularly hard. Much of the weakness reflects growing fears that the group will be disrupted by AI, as offerings from services like ChatGPT and Alphabet’s Gemini cut into demand or pricing power.\nAI represents “existential competition” for some software companies as “AI chatbot and agent dominance becomes the core battlefield,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note this week.\nCompanies like ServiceNow Inc., Adobe Inc., and Salesforce Inc. were among the weakest performers in the tech sector this year. A Morgan Stanley index of SaaS companies is down 10%, compared with a gain of 5% for a broader software index that includes perceived AI winners like Microsoft Corp.\nWhether software’s underperformance continues will be a key stock market theme in 2026. Some Wall Street pros already think it’s overdone. The SaaS group “is trading anywhere between a 30-40% discount relative to what its fundamentals would suggest,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month.\n\nPricey Got Pricier\nConcerns that nose-bleed valuations would hamper the ascent of some of 2024’s hottest stocks in 2025 proved misplaced. Palantir Technologies Inc. turned out to be one of the year’s best performers despite trading at more than 200 times estimated profits for much of the year. The stock’s 146% advance ranks eighth in the S&P 500.\nWall Street has long been skeptical of Palantir, mainly because of the stock’s lofty valuation. Of the 29 the analysts covering the maker of data analysis software, just nine rate the stock a buy. Still, the company is expected to expand at an enviable clip, with revenue projected to jump 43% in 2026 and 39% in 2027, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nElectric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. also overcame concerns about its valuation, which is by far the most expensive among the so-called Magnificent Seven. The stock hit a record this week despite trading at more than 200 times anticipated profits and facing a number of headwinds from slowing EV sales to concerns about safety.\n\nInvestors are optimistic about Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s vision of a self-driving car future and nascent push into robotics. After two years of stagnant revenue growth, Tesla’s sales are expected to expand 13% in 2026 and 19% in 2027.\nAll of which leaves the tech landscape heading into 2026 roughly where it was a year ago. Yes, the stocks are pricey. But the opportunities for growth are there. It’s up to the companies to deliver.\n“Expectations are high and valuations are expensive,” Ameriprise’s Saglimbene said. “That means they have more to prove, and they will really have to exceed expectations to move higher.”\n--With assistance from Phil Serafino.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Is Selling Nvidia and Buying This Other Magnificent Chip Stock Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:52 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Philippe Laffont founded the hedge fund Coatue Management.\nCoatue's largest positions are in leading artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\nLast quarter, Coatue trimmed its exposure to Nvidia and rotated profits into Alphabet stock.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAbout halfway through every quarter, any institutional investment fund that manages more than $100 million is required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), documenting all the stocks that it bought and sold during the prior quarter.\n\nOne such firm that I monitor closely is Coatue Management, founded by Philippe Laffont. During the third quarter, Coatue reduced its position in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by 14% -- selling 1.6 million shares. At the same time, Laffont increased the fund's stake in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) by 259% -- acquiring 5.2 million shares.\nLet's explore what may have motivated these moves and assess if now would be a good time to follow Laffont's lead.\nIs selling Nvidia stock right now a good idea? When OpenAI released ChatGPT to the general public in November 2022, Nvidia's market capitalization was roughly $345 billion. Today, the company is worth $4.3 trillion -- making the chip designer the world's most valuable company.\nAccording to Coatue's filings, the firm has held some exposure to Nvidia stock since 2016. Given Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last few years, taking some gains from a winning long-term position off the table seems reasonable.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia remains the eighth-largest position in Laffont's portfolio -- alongside other AI leaders such as Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Amazon , and Broadcom .\nIn my view, Laffont is employing prudent financial judgment by modestly reducing Coatue's allocation to Nvidia and rotating some capital into other growth opportunities.\nWhy might Laffont like Alphabet stock? Alphabet's trajectory throughout the AI revolution has been almost the opposite of Nvidia's. Following the release of ChatGPT, many on Wall Street started sounding the alarm that the rise of large language models (LLMs) and chatbots could spell the end of traditional internet search engines.\n\nThe bear thesis was real: Chatbots were expected to eat Google's lunch, and Alphabet was facing an existential crisis. It seems like the only people who didn't buy into this doomsday scenario were the executives in charge at Alphabet.\nOver the last three years, the company has quietly made significant progress across a number of different areas within the AI realm:\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet released its own LLM, called Gemini, which is now a fixture on the Google search homepage.\nBeyond its core advertising business, Alphabet has done a stellar job growing its cloud infrastructure business -- Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP has inked a number of high-profile deals with major players including OpenAI and Meta, proving it can compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, which have larger shares of the cloud market.\nAlphabet is also a strategic investor in OpenAI's top rival, Anthropic. As part of their relationship, Anthropic is using Google Cloud to meet some of its computing power needs. Their deal includes access to Alphabet's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\nLastly, Alphabet is one of the leaders in the autonomous driving space; its Waymo self-driving taxi service is operating in several U.S. cities.\n\nI think the biggest selling point for Alphabet is its vertically integrated business model. The company's various assets in search (Google), streaming video (YouTube), consumer electronics (Android), cloud computing (GCP), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), and now custom hardware (TPUs) all share a common thread: artificial intelligence.\nLaffont may be hedging his portfolio away from pure-play semiconductor and data center businesses while seeking exposure to broader pockets of the ongoing AI infrastructure movement.\nIs Alphabet stock a good buy right now? Among the cloud hyperscalers, Alphabet's stock is still the cheapest by forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, though it has in recent months climbed back to near parity with Microsoft.\nThe caveat from the analysis above is that Alphabet has clearly experienced a meaningful valuation expansion over the last couple of months, while the valuations of Amazon and Microsoft have both compressed a bit.\nI think there are two primary factors driving the increased buying.\nFirst, Laffont isn't the only big-name investor betting on Alphabet stock. Warren Buffett also initiated a position in Alphabet last quarter. In addition, a growing number of technologists are beginning to propose that application-specific integrated circuits -- including Google's TPUs -- could pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator realm.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors have flocked to Alphabet, which was trading at reasonable valuations relative to its megacap tech peers. While I think Alphabet remains a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity, there are a couple of important points to think about before jumping into the stock.\nAfter its recent run, Alphabet stock is no longer such a bargain. Moreover, the bull thesis around its opportunity in the chip landscape is currently somewhat theoretical.\nNevertheless, I think following Laffont's lead here could prove wise. If you've owned Nvidia stock throughout the AI revolution, then odds are you're sitting on a nice gain. It might not be a bad choice to take some profits and buy into other emerging players such as Alphabet as the AI infrastructure buildout continues to accelerate.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Trump Media merger with nuclear fusion firm raises questions: analyst\n\nReuters Videos\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:25 PM PST\n\nIn this video: TATE.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nSTORY: On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump’s social media company announced an unusual $6 billion merger with TAE Technologies, a Google-backed nuclear fusion firm. The news that Trump Media, which operates Truth Social, was getting into the nuclear energy business... ...came just days after fusion industry leaders met with representatives of the U.S. Energy Department asking for more federal funding. And that rings some alarm bells says Peter Loge - a professor who heads up the Project on Ethics in Political Communication at The George Washington University. “Any time the president's name is on a commercial enterprise, it raises ethical questions. Any time a member of the president's family's name is on a commercial enterprise, it raises ethical questions. Are people buying the thing because the president's name is on it? Are people buying Trump branded products because they think it'll help him get close to the president or that the president will like them more?\" The growing electricity needs of the technology industry have revived interest in nuclear power. However, despite decades of efforts, nuclear fusion, often seen as a potentially cleaner and more reliable energy source, has yet to produce a commercially viable reactor. The chief executive of TAE, Michl Binderbauer, was among the leaders who met U.S. Energy officials after the department formed its first-ever fusion office. “And the question then becomes, 'Are they going to have a leg up? Is this company going to have a leg up because it is owned in part by a member of the Trump family? You know, will this company have an unfair competitive advantage when working with the federal government, when trying to get investors on board, because it is very publicly affiliated with with President Trump and his family.” After his return to office this year, Trump's close relatives have pursued ventures leveraging his political power and policy shifts. For instance, the Trump family has piled up billions in crypto-related wealth as the president throws his support behind digital financial assets. Greater support from the federal government could potentially boost the value of the fusion investment as well. Trump has 114 million shares in Trump Media, roughly 40% of the company. In the new merger, his ownership stake would be roughly 20%. Trump Media mainly generates ad revenue off of Truth Social and has consistently lost money since it began. Loge says one option is for the president to remove his name from the companies to avoid looking improper. \"Of course, what the president is doing might be completely on the up and up. But we're at a point in our history where we need to both do and be seen to be doing the most noble thing possible. The most noble thing possible here is probably taking your name off of companies that are going to benefit from or even rely on the federal government..\" Trump Media chief executive Devin Nunes, a former Republican member of Congress, will be co-CEO of the new company, along with TAE chief Binderbauer. The two, along with Donald Trump Jr., will sit on the merged company's board.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Down 60%, Should You Buy the Dip on QUBT Stock?\n\nJeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QUBT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Quantum computing stocks have pulled back in recent months on concerns about an AI bubble.\nQuantum Computing Inc. is the smallest of the major quantum computing stocks.\nThere have not been any insider purchases of the stock this year.\n10 stocks we like better than Quantum Computing ›\nQuantum computing stocks have been one of the biggest surprises of 2025.\n\nThe emerging industry, which was virtually unheard of a little more than a year ago, began to gain steam after President Trump was elected, and surged last December when Google announced a breakthrough with its quantum chip, Willow.\nOn the heels of the AI boom, which has driven hundreds of billions of spending on capital expenditures on data centers and chips and added trillions in market value, investors are hopeful that quantum computing could be the next transformative technology.\nQuantum computing is still in its infancy, but the technology has a lot of potential. One of the quantum stocks that has gotten attention from investors this year is Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT) , also known as QCi. As you can see, it's been a rocky year for QCi, and the stock is now down 38%, which includes an early sell-off in the year as the sector gave up some of the gains from Google's Willow announcement.\nQCi is the smallest of the four major quantum computing stocks, and it currently has a market cap of $2.3 billion. However, Quantum Computing Inc. still isn't generating material revenue as it only had revenue of $546,000 over its last four quarters, and $384,000 in the third quarter.\nAfter the pullback following its peak in early October, QCi is now down 60% from its high. Is this a buying opportunity for the quantum stock or a warning sign that it could fall further? Let's explore.\nWhat you need to know about Quantum Computing Inc. With less than $1 million in revenue over the last four quarters, QCi is still a development-stage company.\nThere are a lot of different ways quantum computing is being applied by the different quantum computing companies. QCi's specialty is photonics, or fabricating photonic computing engines using thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN).\n\nThe company opened its photonic chip foundry in Arizona, known as Fab 1, in February, and it's aiming to build a second, larger facility. It's also making progress in commercialization, having received a purchase order from a top 5 U.S. bank for its quantum security solutions. It also took a step forward with its collaboration with NASA.\nQCi looks adequately capitalized at the moment with $352.4 million and no debt, and its operating expenses are modest, at $28.9 million through the first three quarters.\n\nLire la suite\nThe company aims to scale up to industrial-scale manufacturing production, and named Yuping Huang as its permanent CEO after he joined as interim chief in April. Management hasn't given guidance for its production ramp or a revenue target, but Wall Street expects the company to reach revenue of $2.8 million in 2026, more than tripling from 2025.\n\nWhy investors may want to be cautious While Quantum Computing Inc. appears to be making progress toward its goals, there are some reasons to be skeptical of the stock.\nFirst, it trades at a sky-high price-to-sales multiple of more than 2,000, and it looks like it will take years of growth before that ratio starts to look reasonable.\nSecond, the investors who know the company best, the management team, have been busy selling the stock this year, perhaps taking advantage of the surge that took place late last year. In fact, there have been no insider buys. Insiders have sold more than 2 million shares of QCi this year. That's only about 1% of shares outstanding, but these insiders understand the company better than anyone else, considering the technical and difficult-to-understand nature of quantum computing. The gap in understanding the business between management and retail investors is unusually large. It seems notable then that there was no insider purchasing of the stock.\n\nIs Quantum Computing Inc. a buy? Concerns about an AI bubble have pushed the whole quantum computing sector lower since its peak in early October, and that response seems fair.\nIt's still very early with this technology, and the emergence of AI may have led to exaggerated hopes for quantum computing. Quantum Computing Inc. could eventually scale to a meaningful size, but that's likely to take years.\n\nAt this point, investors are better off on the sidelines, waiting for more clarity from the business or a better entry point. Even as QCi has fallen 60% from its peak, it can still go a lot lower from here.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Quantum Computing right now? Before you buy stock in Quantum Computing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Quantum Computing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company May Now Be Winning the AI War\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:52 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After ChatGPT took some of its search traffic, Alphabet rebounded by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode.\nAlphabet's Gemini 3 is considered a leading LLM.\nManagement will increase the tech giant's capital expenditures in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIt's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world in significant ways, and the major hyperscalers are all investing hundreds of billions of dollars in their efforts to capitalize on the trend. Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Does Philippe Laffont Know Something Wall Street Doesn't? The Billionaire Investor Just Sold Nvidia and AMD, and Bought These Other Chip Stocks Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points During the third quarter, Coatue Management reduced its exposure to GPU leaders Nvidia and AMD.\nAt the same time, the firm dramatically increased its stakes in Alphabet and Marvell Technology.\nPhilippe Laffont is making sure his fund has positions across the entire semiconductor landscape.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWithin 45 days of the end of each quarter, every institutional investor managing over $100 million is required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings itemize which stocks they bought and sold during that quarter. This provides everyday investors with a glimpse -- though a delayed one -- into what the \"smart money\" on Wall Street is doing.\nDuring the third quarter, Philippe Laffont's firm, Coatue Management, made a number of interesting moves. It trimmed its exposure in semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) by 14% and 19%, respectively. In addition, Laffont more than tripled the fund's stakes in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) .\nLet's break down what may have influenced these decisions and assess if Laffont could be onto something big.\nNvidia and AMD dominate the AI chip market Nvidia and AMD are the two leading designers of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most widely used parallel processing chips for training large language models and building generative AI applications.\nThe rise of generative AI has ushered in a wave of unprecedented revenue and profit growth for chip designers. Shares of Nvidia and AMD have skyrocketed by nearly 900% and 200%, respectively, throughout the AI revolution.\nManagement consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that investment in AI infrastructure will reach nearly $7 trillion over the next five years -- with the majority of that spending allocated toward building data centers and chip procurement.\nWith that in mind, it seems likely that the hyperscalers will continue accelerating their AI capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Given these secular tailwinds, the prospects surrounding Nvidia and AMD appear bright.\n\nThis begs the question: Does Laffont see something the rest of us don't?\nUnderstanding Alphabet and Marvell's positions in the chip market One of the biggest catalysts for Alphabet right now is its cloud infrastructure business. Google Cloud has attracted a number of high-profile customers, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms .\nMoreover, the company's custom-designed AI processors -- which it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- are becoming a key part of the value proposition around its AI ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile GPUs and other specialized parallel processors get most of the attention among AI investors, there's a lot more that goes into a data center. Marvell can provide much of it: The company specializes in designing architecture for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) computing stacks, as well as other networking, security, and storage hardware.\nAs AI workloads become larger and more sophisticated -- requiring enhanced memory and storage processes -- demand for the offerings of players like Marvell should rise further.\nThe bottom line: The semiconductor opportunity is broadening While analysts appear optimistic about Alphabet's TPU business, these chips are heavily geared toward custom applications such as deep learning. Meanwhile, Marvell is carving out its own pocket in the AI realm focused on data centers' memory storage needs.\nIn my view, Laffont's moves during the third quarter look more like a structural mix shift than a reflection of souring sentiment toward AI GPUs. What I mean by that is the billionaire smartly reduced his fund's exposure to general-purpose chip designers such as Nvidia and AMD and rotated capital into other specific segments of the AI space.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a broader point: Laffont still has significant exposure to the GPU market. It's not as if Coatue completely dumped its stakes in Nvidia and AMD.\nDuring the third quarter, he merely increased his bets on other areas of the chip market beyond generic accelerators. The construction of Coatue's portfolio suggests the firm is quite bullish about the continuing expansion of AI infrastructure. It appears that Laffont is trying to capitalize on this trend by building a diversified portfolio around the proliferation of chips and their various applications in AI.\nAt the end of the day, I think building positions in the major players across GPUs, custom chipsets, memory architecture, and more will prove to be a winning investment strategy in the long run.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

See the full list for free.\nAlphabet Investment Narrative Recap To own Alphabet, you have to believe its AI heavyweights Gemini and Google Cloud can more than offset rising capital spending and its reliance on ad dollars. The latest clean energy and carbon removal deals help de risk the power needs behind that AI build out, but they do not change the near term swing factor, which remains how quickly AI features in Search and Cloud translate into higher revenue versus mounting infrastructure costs.\n\nThe 21 year renewable power agreement with TotalEnergies in Malaysia, alongside the separate 30 megawatt solar deal in Kedah, is directly tied to Alphabet’s AI and cloud capacity expansion in Asia. These contracts matter because they underpin long lived data center investments that support Google Cloud’s AI backlog and Gemini adoption, both central to the current growth catalyst, while reinforcing that AI driven capex will stay elevated for years.\nYet even with AI momentum, investors should be aware that rising capex could squeeze margins if revenue growth slows...\nRead the full narrative on Alphabet (it's free!)\nAlphabet's narrative projects $512.6 billion revenue and $148.4 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 11.3% yearly revenue growth and roughly a $32.8 billion earnings increase from $115.6 billion today.\n\nUncover how Alphabet's forecasts yield a $323.70 fair value , a 9% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Across 191 fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community, views on Alphabet range widely from US$171 to US$340 per share.

      "Content": "Meta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n\nLuke Juricic\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:49 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is readying a technological offensive for 2026, developing a suite of next-generation artificial intelligence models designed to challenge the dominance of OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.\nAccording to the Thursday report from WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter, the social media giant is working on a high-stakes image and video-focused AI model code-named \"Mango.\" Concurrently, the company is developing \"Avocado,\" its next major text-based large language model (LLM).\n\nThe new roadmap was reportedly detailed during an internal Q&A on Thursday featuring Meta’s Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox. The models are expected to release in the first half of 2026, signaling a long-term play to move beyond the incremental updates of the current Llama family.\nThe development of Mango and Avocado represents the first major output from Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a specialized division created after a major restructuring this past summer. To lead the group, CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally orchestrated high-profile recruiting efforts, poaching more than 20 researchers from OpenAI and hiring Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, to oversee the effort.\nThe move underscores Zuckerberg’s willingness to spend aggressively to close the gap with rivals. As part of the transition, Meta reportedly invested over $14 billion to acquire a near-majority stake in Scale AI, cementing Wang’s role as the primary architect of Meta’s post-Llama strategy.\n\nDuring the internal session, Wang emphasized that Avocado will focus heavily on advanced coding capabilities, a traditional weak point for previous Meta models compared to competitors.\nMore ambitiously, Wang noted that Meta is in the early stages of developing \"world models.\" Unlike current LLMs that predict the next word in a sequence, world models aim to understand physical reality by processing vast amounts of visual information.\nMeta stock remained relatively flat in after-hours trade following the WSJ report, though shares rose 2.3% during trading hours.\nRelated articles\nMeta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Michael Burry Asks For Photos Of Warehoused Nvidia GPUs After Analyst Questions Jensen Huang's Blackwell Shipment Numbers (UPDATED)\n\nAnanya Gairola\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nGM\n\n^IXIC\n\nEditor’s Note: This story has been updated to provide additional clarity on Nvidia GPU dies shipped in 2025.\nOver the weekend, Michael Burry , the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" for forecasting the 2008 housing collapse, asked for evidence of stockpiled Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPUs.\n\nThis development came after an analysis on X questioned whether Jensen Huang's statement about Blackwell shipments aligns with the company's reported revenue and U.S. data-center capacity.\nBurry Joins Debate Over Nvidia's Blackwell Shipments Burry's statement came after a detailed thread on X from a user known as Kakashii ignited fresh scrutiny around Nvidia's latest GPU generation.\nThe user, who introduced themselves as an attorney on social media, questioned Huang's statement that six million Blackwell GPUs have already shipped.\n\nHuang said in October 2025 that demand for Nvidia's chips is still surging, noting that the company has shipped 6 million Blackwell GPUs over the past four quarters, reported CNBC.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAt the time, he also stated that Nvidia expects a combined $500 billion in GPU sales across the Blackwell line and next year's Rubin generation.\nAccording to the analysis shared by Kakashii on X, Nvidia's reported $111 billion in data-center revenue since Blackwell launched does not appear to support that shipment volume.\nEven after factoring in the more than $10 billion Nvidia disclosed in the 2024 fourth-quarter Blackwell revenue, the thread argues the numbers only account for roughly 4 million units, leaving a potential gap of hundreds of thousands to millions of GPUs.\n\nPower and Data-Center Capacity Add Another Layer Of Questions The thread also pointed to the enormous energy requirements of running Blackwell chips.\nIf 6 million GPUs shipped and 65% to 70% were deployed in U.S. data centers, they would require 8.5 to 11 gigawatts of power — roughly equivalent to the electricity capacity of Singapore, the analyst said.\nHowever, the U.S. only added an estimated 8.5 gigawatts of data-center-usable capacity between 2024 and 2025, the user noted. That assumes every new facility uses only Nvidia hardware and no Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) or Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google chips.\nEven then, the user argued, the power supply barely matches the stated GPU shipment volume.\n\nStory Continues\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nBurry Calls For Receipts: ‘Calling For Pics And Proof' Sharing the thread, Burry urged X users to send him photos or proof of Nvidia GPUs being stored \"in mass quantities\" in the U.S. or overseas.\n\"Some have reached out to me,\" he wrote, adding, \"it is getting interesting. But I need more.\"\nNotably, the bar chart shown at Nvidia's GTC DC in October reflected 6 million GPU dies shipped in calendar year 2025.\nA footnote on the slide noted that the Blackwell and Rubin architectures use two GPU dies per chip. As a result, while 6 million GPU dies were shipped, the total came to 3 million complete GPU packages.\n\nDespite Nvidia's Pushback, Burry Says His Bearish Thesis Still Holds Up Last month, Burry doubled down on his bearish view of Nvidia, reaffirming his analysis on X just hours after the company privately pushed back his past claims. Burry argues the company's $112.5 billion in buybacks added no real shareholder value and only offset stock-based compensation.\nMeanwhile, analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo defended Nvidia, saying concerns about rising Days Sales Outstanding and inventory levels misunderstand the company's sales patterns and preparation for new Blackwell chips.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged 31.88% so far this year, outperforming both the Nasdaq Composite's 22.29% gain and the Nasdaq 100's 22.49% rise.

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The AI chip conversation begins with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , the company that has dominated this market from the jump.\nHowever, tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has emerged as a potential competitor after successfully training its AI models with custom-built TPU chips it designed in-house.\nWhich AI chip stock is the better buy heading into 2026?\nNvidia's AI dominance creates a high ceiling, but a lower floor Thus far, developing AI has required massive quantities of chips.

Some experts believe Nvidia's market share in the data center GPU chip space is as high as 92%.\nAs long as hyperscalers continue to build out this infrastructure, it's hard to see Nvidia's business slowing down anytime soon. In fact, Nvidia announced that it has booked $500 billion in orders for its Blackwell chips and their looming successor, Rubin, through the end of next year, with $150 billion of that already delivered.\n\nThis data center boom has been highly lucrative. Nvidia now has deep pockets to develop and prepare for emerging AI opportunities outside of data centers, such as autonomous vehicles and humanoid robotics. That said, data center chip sales have become nearly the entirety of Nvidia's business. If data center investments dry up, Nvidia would struggle to fill those holes, and the stock would likely collapse.\nAlphabet's AI ecosystem makes it the safer bet For as much money pouring into AI data centers as there is, the group of companies cutting the checks, the AI hyperscalers, is relatively small. Among them is Google's parent company, Alphabet. Rather than relying on Nvidia's chips to power its AI models, Alphabet has worked diligently to develop its own custom-built tensor processing units, or TPUs, designed specifically for Google Cloud's machine learning workloads.\n\nStory continues\nAlphabet successfully trained its newest Gemini model on its TPUs. It went so well that the company is considering selling its TPUs to other AI hyperscalers, such as Meta Platforms . Alphabet probably won't challenge Nvidia's market leadership, but the TPU represents additional upside to Alphabet's complete AI ecosystem. It's icing on an already delicious cake.\n\nThe stock already has a high floor due to its lucrative advertising and cloud computing business segments. Even if Alphabet never sells its TPUs to another company, they still provide a crucial cost benefit, saving Alphabet from spending billions of dollars on third-party chips. At this point, it appears that Alphabet has a significantly higher floor than Nvidia.\nThe winner? It depends Does that make Alphabet the better buy? Well, it sort of depends on the style of investor you are. If you want maximum upside, it's hard to beat Nvidia, which has proven to possess the foresight needed to dominate the AI opportunity from the beginning. Even if other companies begin encroaching on the data center market, Nvidia will likely remain a key player in the AI field, including future applications.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a business that is a bit more diversified and stable, Alphabet may be a better fit for you. The company has multiple established business units and still offers exposure to new industries, like autonomous driving and quantum computing, through its smaller divisions.\nThe good news? Both stocks trade at attractive valuations, based on the market's expectations for their future earnings growth.\nA higher anticipated growth rate accompanies Nvidia's higher price-to-earnings ratio, though things can change quickly if the AI investment cycle ends prematurely.\nUltimately, it's hard to go wrong with either company as a buy-and-hold AI investment for 2026 and beyond.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "4 Companies Are Betting on AI Security. Here’s Who’s Best Positioned.\n\nWilliam Temple\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 1:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ARLO\n\nADT\n\nGOOG\n\nREZI\n\nQuick Read Google’s stock gained 60% year-to-date versus ADT’s 21%, suggesting markets favor AI providers over monitoring operators.\nADT generates $1.10B from recurring monitoring with 25.7% operating margins. Arlo’s $510M revenue produces only 0.84% profit margins.\nADT’s 24.7% earnings growth outpaces 4.4% revenue growth, indicating AI improves profitability more than expansion.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe smart home security market is undergoing a fundamental shift as AI moves from buzzword to business driver. We analyzed four players to determine who actually benefits from the AI security trend.\nThe Four Contenders ADT: The Monitoring Leader ADT ( NYSE:ADT ) operates the traditional model: 6.5 million customers paying monthly fees for 24/7 professional monitoring. The company generates $5.11 billion in annual revenue, with $1.10 billion from recurring monitoring subscriptions. Their strategic bet centers on the ADT+ platform, integrating AI capabilities through a partnership with Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ).\n\nResideo Technologies: The Hardware Play Resideo Technologies ( NYSE:REZI ) brings Honeywell Home, First Alert, and Control4 brands to 150 million spaces worldwide. They focus on HVAC controls, smoke detection, and home safety equipment. Revenue reaches $7.44 billion annually, but they sell hardware and controls rather than monitoring services.\n\nArlo Technologies: The Camera Specialist Arlo Technologies ( NASDAQ:ARLO ) takes a pure-play approach to security cameras with Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity. Based in San Jose, they generate $510 million in annual revenue from camera sales and optional cloud storage subscriptions.\nGoogle: The AI Partner Google enters as both competitor and collaborator. Their Nest product line competes directly in smart home hardware, while their ADT partnership provides AI capabilities to the monitoring leader. This is of course a rounding error for Google's massive business outside of this zone, but you should look at them as a player getting a foothold in yet another industry, rather than a pureplay like others.\n\nHow the Business Models Compare Revenue stability separates these players. ADT's monitoring business produces predictable monthly income with 25.7% operating margins. Customers typically stay for years, creating a durable revenue stream that generated $2.66 billion in EBITDA over the past twelve months.\nResideo operates a fundamentally different model. They manufacture and distribute products through retail and contractor channels. While revenue is larger at $7.44 billion, operating margins of 8.42% reflect the lower-margin hardware business. The company reports a profit margin of negative 8.61%, indicating structural challenges.\n\nStory Continues\nArlo faces the toughest economics. Their $510 million in revenue produces just $4.28 million in net income, translating to a 0.84% profit margin. The standalone camera business lacks the recurring revenue that makes monitoring services valuable.\nGoogle's position is unique. The partnership allows Google to monetize AI technology through ADT's installed base without bearing the costs of operating a monitoring network.\n\nWhat Management Is Saying ADT CEO Jim DeVries emphasized execution in the Q3 2025 call: \"ADT again delivered solid revenue growth, robust cash flow, and very strong earnings per share in the third quarter, reflecting the resilience of our business model and our team's execution of our strategy.\"\nThe company completed a $1 billion refinancing of senior secured notes and bought back $112 million in shares during Q3. These are moves of a mature business optimizing capital structure, not a company betting aggressively on AI disruption.\n\nAnalysts remain divided. Morgan Stanley lowered their price target from $9.50 to $9.00, maintaining an equal weight rating. Citigroup raised their target to $10 with a buy rating. The disagreement centers on growth: analysts project 12% earnings growth for ADT in 2026, below the market's 16% average.\nWho Actually Benefits Most As with many industries, the evidence points to Google as the primary beneficiary. Google gains distribution through ADT's customer base without operational costs or customer acquisition expenses.\nADT benefits secondarily through improved margins and customer retention. Their 24.7% earnings growth outpaces 4.4% revenue growth, indicating AI helps profitability more than top-line expansion. The company secured a major partnership with D.R. Horton, the nation's largest homebuilder, to install ADT systems in new homes.\n\nResideo and Arlo face structural disadvantages. Neither possesses the recurring revenue model that makes AI investment economically viable at scale. Resideo's negative profitability and Arlo's razor-thin margins suggest their business models struggle even before accounting for AI development costs.\nThe Bottom Line Google captures the most value from AI-enhanced home security through its ADT partnership and Nest products. ADT benefits from operational improvements but faces skepticism about growth acceleration. Traditional hardware players lack the business model to compete effectively in an AI-driven market.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "ChatGPT’s mobile app hits new milestone of $3B in consumer spending\n\nSarah Perez\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:50 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: XAAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nChatGPT has hit a new milestone of $3 billion in worldwide consumer spending on mobile as of this week, according to estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures . This figure represents the total spending on iOS and Android devices since the app’s launch in May 2023, when it first arrived, then only on iOS.\nWhat’s notable is that the bulk of that spending took place this year. Worldwide, consumers spent an estimated $2.48 billion in the ChatGPT mobile app in 2025, representing a 408% year-over-year increase from the $487 million spent in 2024. In 2023, the app’s first year of availability, it earned $42.9 million, before growing 1,036% to reach the 2024 figure.\nThese numbers represent a sharp rise in consumer adoption, compared with other popular apps. For instance, it took ChatGPT 31 months to reach $3 billion in consumer spending, but the top earner, TikTok, took 58 months to do so, Appfigures told TechCrunch.\nChatGPT also reached the milestone faster than top streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max, which hit the $3 billion figure in 42 months and 46 months, respectively.\nxAI’s Grok, however, is seeing a similar revenue trajectory to ChatGPT, compared with other AI rivals.\nGrok was released in late 2023 to X Premium Plus subscribers before becoming more broadly available last year. But if you compare the pace of consumer spending across AI apps, Grok came the closest to matching ChatGPT’s cumulative revenue at the same point, once it began monetizing. (You can see this on the chart below, which plots the AI apps’ spending aligned to when each app began monetizing.)\nWhile the $3 billion in spending represents a significant uptake by consumers, it’s not the only way to measure AI app adoption or potential long-term revenue.\nChatGPT’s mobile customers are buying paid subscriptions, like the $20 per month ChatGPT Plus or the $200 per month ChatGPT Pro for advanced users. But AI apps can generate revenue in other ways, including through developer offerings and, perhaps soon for ChatGPT , ads. In addition, ChatGPT on Wednesday launched its own app store of sorts, which the company suggests will be monetized in some way in the future, its blog post noted .\nGoogle, meanwhile, is exploring the potential to transition its healthy search ads business to AI-powered search, placing ads in AI Mode , AI Overviews , AI shopping , and an increasingly AI-powered Discover page , among other things.\nAnthropic is aiming at the business market and is reportedly on track for $70 billion in revenue by 2028.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What it takes to construct an AI data center, Hut 8 CEO outlines\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:50 AM PST\n\nIn this video: GOOG\n\nOWL\n\nORCL\n\nHUT\n\nHut 8 Corp. ( HUT ) unveiled its own partnership with Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Fluidstack to build an AI data center in Louisiana. Alphabet's Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) is providing the backstop on this latter deal.\nHut 8 CEO Asher Genoot joins Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to further discuss the logistics behind constructing the data center, designing the systems inside the facility, and Google's credit history that ultimately enabled this deal.\nAlso watch Asher Genoot explain some of the details of the data center deal and Google's invaluable role in securing it.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nI'm sure you've seen these stories recently, Azure of the difficulty building AI infrastructure, building out these data centers. You know, Core Weve stock has gotten absolutely hammered the past six weeks because of delays in building out their sites. What, how hard is it to bring these sites to life and what challenges do you anticipate over the next year?\n00:23 Speaker B\nSo there's two things there. One is expectation management. We actually have told the customer we're going to deliver the data center, start delivering the first data hall in Q2 of 2027. That gives us ample runway and a conservative delivery schedule to make sure that we're able to push to deliver on time, rather than be crunched on a schedule that's really tight already. And second, it's all about do you have the local labor? Do you have the general contracting? Because there are so many of these data centers being built, are there the people to actually build and manage these?\n01:00 Speaker B\nSo with Jacob's Engineering as a design and engineering firm, we have an engineering group and we have a construction group. Then local contractors like MMR, Cajun, Turner, these are all local contractors on electrical, civil, mechanical in the state of Louisiana that have already committed to our facility and the manpower required to build this site. Then what goes into the data center? It's the actual supply chain. Verve is our partner on from a supply chain perspective, delivering long lead time items.\n01:40 Speaker B\nMany of those we're actually going to skid so we can actually do a lot of the manufacturing and the uh assembly offsite. And so when we bring it on site, it's a faster execution and deployment as well. So I think giving customers more conservative schedules, meanwhile bringing together a group of partners that have already committed to those expectations is critical. And that's why it took us a little bit longer to announce this deal because if we just announced a customer deal, that would have been great, we would have to figure out how to actually deliver after signing the contract.\n02:19 Speaker B\nHere, we signed all of these commitments at the same time and so we're not only delivering a commitment to the customer, but we have commitments from all of our partners that they are going to deliver on that same commitment.\n02:35 Speaker A\nSo the market rewarding Hut 8, uh also a couple of your competitors, but on the other side of the spectrum, you have the market worried about a company like Oracle and Blue Owl Capital and perhaps Oracle having too much debt and Blue Owl Capital not supporting their initiatives. Is the market right to have those debt fears?\n03:04 Speaker B\nThere's a lot of dollars being deployed into infrastructure today. And at the end of the day, these are long-term commitments. For us, we had multiple customers that we were negotiating, dealing with and working with, and credit is so important. Is this a customer that in all scenarios, AI strong, AI weaker, but in all scenarios will pay on their lease obligations. And that's why having this Google backstop and this financial backstop on all lease payments, roughly about $7 billion throughout the course of this project.\n03:45 Speaker B\non all minimum power bills, about a billion dollars on other pass through expenses like insurance, operations, taxes and so forth. Having that commitment is critical because Google, in our opinion, is one of the most creditworthy companies in the world. They have a strong core business through their search engine that is able to generate one of the best cash flows as a company in the whole world. Then they have Gemini, they have their own TPUs in terms of manufacturing their own chips.\n04:23 Speaker B\nThey own YouTube, they own Android, they own Waymo for car uh collection. I think the next frontier of AI training is not just text training of the web, but on video recognition as well. So if you think about the all the footage that they pick up in those Waymo cars, all the video uh footage that they have in uh in on YouTube, we are massive believers not to even mention Quantum which they're leading in as well. And so we're big believers that Google has strong cash flows, one of the best in the world and that they also have a diversified business stream and is able to continue to grow and become a stronger and stronger business and partnering with them having their financial back stop and guarantee behind this project.\n05:14 Speaker B\nI think has given us, our lenders, our partners all a ton of confidence in the value of this specific deal.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company\n\nSamantha Dorisca\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nDarrell Spencer is shattering various glass ceilings.\nThe Chicago native credits his hustling nature to his parents. His mother works as a postmaster for the United States Postal Service. His father worked for the Chicago Police Department and rose through the ranks to become a commander before retiring. His father also has a real estate portfolio, which was an additional stream of revenue for the family and was an early sign for Spencer that there are other financial paths to follow outside the confines of corporate America.\n\nWorking In Big Tech After completing a bachelor’s in economics at Connecticut College on a full-tuition national scholarship, Spencer got a job in finance but later pivoted into big tech. He has worked at Facebook, Google, Pinterest, and LinkedIn within their customer sales department in advertising, he told AFROTECH. Still, he felt called to entrepreneurship.\n“I helped them generate millions of dollars in revenue through a strategy across each different platform at each company that I was at,” he shared. “Did really well there. However, I just didn’t feel fulfilled. I woke up every day feeling just like it was routine. And it got to a point where I was very dissatisfied with the trajectory of my life. I felt as if there was more in life that I had to do. And growing up, I’ve always known that I wanted to do something in business … I just never knew what I wanted to do, but I’ve always known I wanted to create.”\n\nLeap Into Entrepreneurship In 2021, Spencer’s first swing as a founder was with Kings Crowning, which offered a satin-lined cap that was a functional, stylish, alternative bonnet for men. The business launched from a storage unit and grew into a multimillion-dollar company, leading him to become a first-generation CEO and millionaire by the time he was 27 years old, per Business Insider.\n\nCrowned Skin Fast forward to March 2024, and Spencer is on to his next brainchild, Crowned Skin, a science-backed skincare and grooming brand for men. The inspiration for the company came from a place of frustration while walking down retail aisles, seeing little representation and few innovative products for men in these categories, he told AFROTECH\n.\nSpencer made an upfront investment of between $10,000 and $15,000 into Crowned Skin with the income generated from King’s Crowning, coupled with real estate investments. These funds were recouped within a few months, he recalled. The investment gave him the financial freedom to create products, establish warehousing, and fund advertising.\n“I just wanted to create products that made men feel seen and confident,” Spencer explained. “I think men across the board, there’s this stigma when it comes down to men’s beauty, men’s grooming. It’s this hush topic that men don’t feel comfortable talking about.”\n\nStory Continues\nCrowned Skin offers body butter, cologne, and body oil in a range of scents, including its newest scent, Empire.\nSpencer has been intentional with growing the company to be profitable and self-sustaining. Strategic decisions, such as pivoting early in Crowned Skin’s marketing messaging, have helped him guide the company towards those goals. Working at various big tech companies as an ads manager allowed him to understand the power of attention and how to retain it.\n\nThis knowledge influenced how the brand positioned its products. Spencer showed the functionality of the products, which include ultra-moisturizing and healing properties; aligned with what would resonate with men, such as the allure of certain scents; and demonstrated the products’ efficiency, as they could cut morning routines in half by functioning as a two-in-one product.\n“We ended up running with those street marketing pieces. And then we learned that through creative messaging, through compelling five- to ten-second ad content around that messaging, that’s what really compelled. That’s what really propelled the business forward very, very fast,” he acknowledged.\n“So then at that point, we were getting our revenue shot up. The business was funding itself. We were very profitable. We were mindful of our return on ad spend, and we were able to scale up as more funds came in. And the next thing we knew, at that point, we really didn’t need any outside investments,” he added. “We didn’t need any other injections of capital … We chose to scale intentionally and scale when revenue came in.”\n\nRevenue Crowned Skin earned $4 million in revenue within its first year and is now a multi-million-dollar company, Spencer confirmed to AFROTECH\n. This feat is aided by strong teams across financial, fulfillment, product development, and manufacturing. Additionally, e-commerce has remained a major component of Crowned Skin’s success through Amazon and TikTok Shop, which have particularly helped boost revenue for the venture.\n“If you want to be a highly competitive and successful brand and company in today’s age, you need to diversify, be on every e-commerce channel across the board, and be your best at all of them. TikTok Shop has been huge. TikTok shop is becoming one of our biggest revenue channels. And the way that you can work with affiliates and really seed samples and fuel your company through affiliates, but also the age of live selling on TikTok, we’re coming into a whole new age of e-commerce marketing,” Spencer explained.\nTikTok Shop has become a six-figure-a-month channel for the company. Crowned Skin also makes history as the first Black male-founded skincare company to reach the #2 spot on TikTok Shop, according to information shared with AFROTECH\n.\n“I get to really be a forward-thinking leader in this space as a Black man in an underrepresented category where there’s not many other Black males doing this … This all was self-taught … Representation is everything for me because I think there’s so many other Black men out there that are in that similar position, but honestly, fear might stunt them. I’m really proud that I get to really create this amazing company and showcase all that you can do as a Black man. If you truly put your head down, it really works,” Spencer explained.\n\nFirst Retail Partnership The overarching goal is to position Crowned Skin as a one-stop shop for men’s grooming. There are currently various products in research and development, including body washes and deodorants, Spencer told AFROTECH\n. It will also soon gain greater visibility following its first-ever retail partnership with Walmart.com. There are plans to later expand regionally, then nationally on store shelves, Spencer shared.\nSpencer also stated that he intends to raise a Series A, likely in 2026, to scale the company globally.\n\n“I want Crowned Skin to be around for years and years, and I want it to last even when I’m not here. I want this to be a legacy company … I want global access … That’ll be an amazing opportunity for us to scale to even more heights, bring on an amazing partner or partners right in this space that have done it, that have scaled companies to nine, 10 figures, and that can really position Crowned Skin to be one of the most dominating forces in men’s grooming,” he expressed.\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Buffett has likely had the greatest influence on my investing journey because his buy-and-hold method resonates strongly with me. When Buffett makes a move, I tend to pay attention because I want to see what he and his management team see.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also a huge fan of tech stocks (which is an area that Buffett has often steered clear of). I think tech stocks are among the most interesting investments on Wall Street because the companies are often dynamic and bring innovation to every sector of Wall Street. Whether you have a consumer goods company, a financial services organization, or a healthcare operation, you rely on technological advancements to improve your business and stay ahead of the competition.\nRecently, I have been paying closer attention to a company that offers the best of both worlds. It has outstanding management, strong earnings, and an insurmountable moat (just like Buffett prefers). And it also claims a front-row seat to how the world is changing and will be one of the most critical companies to help us get there.\nMy pick for the best buy-it-today-and-hold-it-forever stock is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nAbout Alphabet stock Alphabet is a member of the \" Magnificent Seven \" group of stocks that's been dominating Wall Street for the last several years, and it's also one of the biggest publicly traded companies in the world. Currently, Alphabet has a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion.\nThe company's stock is up a whopping 61% this year, which is great considering that Alphabet got off to a rough start, falling into bear market territory in April before recovering.\nOf course, with that comes a hefty valuation, but considering the sandbox that Alphabet plays in, its forward price-to-earnings ratio isn't that bad. There are four companies on the planet with a market cap greater than $3 trillion, and Alphabet stacks up favorably to them all.\nWhat to like about Alphabet stock There are two major things I'm looking at with Alphabet right now. First is the company's business model and revenue. And all that is good. Alphabet just turned in its first-ever quarter of $100 billion in revenue, bringing in $102.34 billion in the third quarter, up 16% from last year. The vast majority of that comes from advertising, which brought in $74.18 billion in the quarter thanks to its powerful YouTube platform, as well as its dominant position in internet search, in which Google maintains a 90% market share.\n\nStory Continues\nAll that helps Alphabet maintain 31% operating margin, with net income in the third quarter of $34.97 billion and $2.87 per share, up from $26.3 billion and $2.12 per share a year ago.\nThe second thing that I appreciate is Alphabet's innovation. Faced with a massive threat a year ago, as ChatGPT, TikTok, and other social media platforms threatened to cut into Google's search dominance, Alphabet harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to work in its favor. It rolled out AI Overviews on its search pages, generating summaries to answer users' queries using generative AI and advanced reasoning.\n\nAlphabet also uses AI to optimize and improve advertising, and on YouTube to recommend content.\nFinally, there's Google Cloud, the company's fast-growing cloud computing segment. Cloud computing is a growing field because companies running or training AI programs don't want to invest in expensive semiconductor clusters. Cloud services like Google Cloud are a more reasonable alternative, and it's one of the reasons why Google Cloud revenue jumped 33.5% in the third quarter from a year ago.\nAlphabet's growth curve is expected to continue, which is impressive for a company of its size and maturity.\nAlphabet is a buy right now Of course, I also can't ignore that Berkshire Hathaway took a stake in Alphabet in the third quarter -- and while it's impossible to know if Buffett himself pulled the trigger, the purchase of nearly 18 million shares of Alphabet stock will go down in history as one of the last transactions under Buffett's reign as CEO.\n\nThe company's core advertising business is a profit center that can't be duplicated, despite efforts by competitors such as Microsoft , Meta Platforms , and Amazon to encroach on the digital advertising market. Alphabet has too many advantages, is too entrenched, and management has proven its ability to adapt to any challenges. Meanwhile, the Google Cloud opportunity will continue to provide outsize growth to Alphabet's bottom line.\nI think it's the best stock to have right now for long-term investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $511,196 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,047,897 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 954 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Hut 8 CEO says $7 billion data center deal with Google is 'first domino to fall'\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 10:31 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: HUT\n\nGOOG\n\nBTC-USD\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nGS\n\nThe \"crypto miner\" label is becoming a relic of the past for Hut 8 ( HUT ).\nIn a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ). The move effectively trades the volatility of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for the high-margin stability of AI infrastructure.\n\n\"We think that the value of energy will continue to go up, and so for us, we [had] to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers, but that drove a strong return to our shareholders,\" Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\nThe market is rewarding the transformation. The energy infrastructure company's stock surged roughly 20% on Wednesday following the announcement as investors cheered its potential to secure blue-chip partners in a crowded field.\nBeyond the one-day pop, the stock has been a standout in the mining-to-AI pivot, fueled by the company's deep energy assets and its strategic partnership with American Bitcoin ( ABTC ), a Trump family enterprise in which Hut 8 holds a 60% stake. Year to date, Hut 8 stock is up 90%.\n\nThe linchpin of the Louisiana project is a financial guarantee from Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), which guarantees payments of the 15-year lease if Fluidstack, an AI cloud infrastructure provider, cannot meet them. The deal secures 245 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with the possibility to scale up to 2,300 MW within that timeframe — a move that could swell the total lease value to $17.7 billion.\n\n\"We're very excited because it's the first domino to fall,\" Genoot said. \"If we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full strategic partnership on 2,300 MW, we see a lot of growth upside for the company and the deal overall.\"\nThe creditworthiness was the key. Genoot noted that without Google's involvement, securing project financing from titans like JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) at favorable rates would have been nearly impossible.\nHe added that Google has a \"strong core business,\" including diversified cash flows from Search, YouTube, and cloud services, making the tech giant's pledge the ultimate security for a 15-year infrastructure play.\nHowever, securing the money is only half the battle. Competitors have seen their stocks hammered due to construction delays. Genoot claims Hut 8 has de-risked the execution side, partly by issuing a \"conservative delivery schedule\" and tapping local labor.\nThe company has turned to established industrial partners, including Jacobs Engineering for design and local contractors like Cajun Electric for electrical services. By scheduling the first data hall delivery for Q2 2027, Genoot said the company is avoiding the \"crunch\" of unrealistic timelines that has plagued the sector.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We signed all of these commitments at the same time,\" Genoot said. \"We're not only delivering a commitment to the customer, but we have commitments from all of our partners that they are going to deliver on that same commitment.\"\nAs Hut 8 doubles down on its new identity, the Miami-based company may still be undervalued by a market that largely views it through a crypto lens.\nAccording to Genoot, the Louisiana deal is just the beginning. \"It's about repeating this program again and again and again to start growing the value of this company,\" he said.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Starting in 2029, the streaming platform will broadcast the Oscars, marking a major shift for one of the entertainment industry's most recognizable events.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nYouTube's first telecast will be the 101st Academy Awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said it signed a multiyear deal running from 2029 through 2033. The agreement covers more than the awards ceremony itself, including red carpet arrivals, behind the scenes access, and coverage of the Governors Ball. Alphabet said U.S. viewers will be able to watch through YouTube TV, while audiences elsewhere can stream the show for free on YouTube.\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan said the partnership is about bringing the Oscars to a broader global audience while honoring its long standing cultural legacy. The move comes after the Academy's current deal with Disney's ABC, which runs through 2028.\nFor investors, the deal highlights YouTube's growing push into premium live events and its ambition to turn traditional TV moments into global streaming experiences.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Set to commence construction in early 2026, the Citra Energies solar farm will deliver renewable energy to power Google’s data center operations in the country.\nNew Deal Extends TTE’s Existing Collaboration With Google Google wants to utilize clean energy for its new AI based data centers and has been entering into long-term agreements with power providers for 24/7 supply of clean electricity. Last month, Google selected TotalEnergies to supply renewable power for its data centers in the United States.\n\nThe new contract to supply clean energy to Google’s data center in Malaysia seems to be an extension of the existing partnership of both these companies. TotalEnergies has been successfully providing clean energy to its customers across the globe, with is also acting in favour of this multi-energy provider.\n\nHow Will This Deal Benefit TTE? This long-term renewable power supply deal will secure a stable revenue stream for the company.\n\nThis deal will allow TotalEnergies to tap deeply into growing opportunities in the Southeast Asian region in the long run, as this region is experiencing rising demand for power supply due to the establishment of new data centers. The company is set to build a renewable power plant in Malaysia, providing access to the Malaysian market and offering strong, sustainable growth potential.\n\nThis new deal is in sync with TotalEnergies’ long-term vision on clean energy generation. The company is gradually building a portfolio of low-carbon businesses that could account for 15-20% of sales by 2040.\n\nRising Demand for Clean Energy The demand for clean energy is rising due to the development of large AI-based data centers, usage of more electric vehicles and higher usage of residential customers. Given the expected increase in clean energy demand, the power providers are also expanding their clean energy generation capacity.\n\nTotalEnergies continues to expand its clean energy generation capabilities to meet growing customer demand. Gross installed renewable power generation capacity was 32.3 GW at the end of the third quarter of 2025, up from 24.2 GW at the end of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOther operators have also outlined their goals to generate more energy from clean energy sources. With the changing demand scenario, these companies continue to make upward revision in their generation capacity.\n\nPrice Movement of TTE Over the past six months, TTE’s shares have risen 5.4%, which beat the industry’s growth of 1.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nZacks Rank & Key Pick TTE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "3 Best AI ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Quantum computing is an exciting theme, but one that's going to take some time to play out.\nInvestors should consider a broad spectrum of names beyond just the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nThe three ETFs below offer a range of options for investors to gain exposure to the AI sector.\n10 stocks we like better than Defiance Quantum ETF ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already well on its way to being the biggest technological revolution since the internet -- and it's still in the early innings.\nWhile names such as Nvidia , Microsoft , OpenAI , and Alphabet have emerged as the \"faces\" of AI, there are plenty of potential winners throughout the sector. Infrastructure builders, enterprise software creators, application developers, and cloud providers all play an integral part to the ecosystem. AI is far more than just semiconductor manufacturers.\nThat's why when it comes to investing in AI, it may be better to just buy the theme instead of trying to pick individual winners. Some of the biggest returns so far have been delivered by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. But stretched valuations, evidence of slowing momentum, and questions surrounding whether all the AI development spending will be worth it are beginning to plague some companies.\nAn ETF that can maintain exposure to some of those megacap names but look beyond them for additional opportunities may be the way to play it in 2026. Here are the three artificial intelligence ETFs that I'm favoring as we head into the new year.\n1. Defiance Quantum ETF If you're interested in true futuristic tech, quantum computing is probably for you. If artificial intelligence is the next revolution, quantum is the rocket that could really propel it to the next level.\nQuantum computing involves developing the technology for processing and calculating at speeds far beyond what traditional computers can do today. It has potential applications in technology, medicine, energy, finance, scientific discovery, and more.\n\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF (NASDAQ: QTUM) invests in companies at the forefront of quantum development. Top holdings right now include Tower Semiconductor , Rigetti Computing , Teradyne , Coherent , and Micron Technology .\nThe only Magnificent Seven name among the top 10 holdings is Alphabet, and it only comes in at No. 10, with a weight of 1.8%. So there's good diversification here relative to the broader tech sector and the equity market in general.\nQuantum is a little more niche and a lot more appropriate for a long-term holding than traditional AI stocks. It may be years before quantum becomes anything close to having mainstream applications, so it should be considered an investment in potential more than concrete current results.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF The Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) looks more like a traditional big tech ETF, but it's careful to include companies of all sizes and from all around the world. In that way, it's designed to be a more inclusive and comprehensive take on AI investing.\nThe fund's index starts by grouping companies in two categories:\n\nAI developers: Includes product and services developers and users, as well as companies that offer AI solutions as a service to customers.\nAI and big data analytics: Semiconductor, storage, and/or hardware manufacturers, as well as quantum computing developers.\nA minimum \"exposure score\" is required for inclusion. Qualifying components are weighted by market cap.\nAIQ is a nice middle ground between big and small companies, although it definitely tilts toward large caps. The AI exposure requirement is a nice way to build the portfolio and ensure that the fund is more of a pure AI play than just a generic megacap tech fund.\n3. Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) describes itself as the world's first generative AI ETF. It's unique in that it's the only actively managed fund among the three, which is advantageous in such a rapidly evolving space. But it also leans more toward the megacap names.\n\nTop holdings currently include Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms , and Palantir . Amazon , Broadcom , and Advanced Micro Devices also reside in the top 10, so there's very much a Nasdaq-100 index feel to this fund.\nIf you're looking for a straightforward, more \"conservative\" way to invest in AI, CHAT might not be a bad choice. You get the heavy large-cap exposure without a lot of the risk that comes from investing in newer or emerging names.\nShould you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF right now? Before you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Defiance Quantum ETF wasn’t one of them.

( HUT ) unveiled its own partnership with Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Fluidstack to build an AI data center in Louisiana. Alphabet's Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) is providing the backstop on this latter deal.\nHut 8 CEO Asher Genoot joins Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to explain how vital Google was to making this deal happen. Also watch Asher Genoot explain some of the details of the data center deal.\nHut 8 also owns a majority stake in American Bitcoin ( ABTC ), which was co-founded by Eric and Donald Trump, Jr.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nHow important was it that Google backstopped all this?\n00:03 Asher\nCritical. I mean, without Google, we would not be able to get JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs to commit the balance sheet financing to be able to give us up to 85% of the actual cost to build a data center for project financing, and at a really low rate of SOFR plus 2.25% target. And so overall, the the clarity of Google backstopping, and think about this.\n00:30 Asher\nIt's a $7 billion deal, that's roughly $450 million a year.\n00:33 Asher\n$450 million on average a year for 15 years for Hut 8 transforms the business. You look at mostly data center infrastructure multiples trade at a 15 to 20x multiple. That's somewhere between 7 and a half to 9 billion dollars of overall value. You take out the build costs, you're at 5 and a half to 7 billion dollars of equity value creation. And so overall, we're extremely excited because if you think about the company today, 330 megawatts alone is worth more than our full market cap today.\n01:10 Asher\nIn addition to that, we own 60% of American Bitcoin, which is another publicly traded company we have with the Trumps. That's worth about a billion dollars. We have about 10,000 Bitcoin on the balance sheet, that's worth another billion dollars. And then we have 9,000 megawatts, 1,000 that we currently operate, another 8,000 of new development megawatts that I haven't even counted. And so we're extremely excited that about the company, its future growth potential. I think this is the first step in showing the market we have an ability to take a site from the very, very beginning on a piece of land that we find to bring it to a commercialized AI data center.\n01:43 Speaker A\nAsher, what's the next step? Because if I, if it's, if I have this correct, you have a pipeline. What does that pipeline look like? And and are you just on the cusp of announcing more deals like you just announced?\n01:54 Asher\nYeah, so when we announced this deal, creating a program with partners that could scale is really important. You brought up Jacobs engineering. They have 40,000 contractors and engineers. You have Vertiv, one of the best equipment manufacturers within the whole data center space. Obviously, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have some of the largest balance sheets as banks. So we put together a group of partners that we believe could scale with us in our development pipeline. And so we spent this whole year creating that foundation, find the right customers who have the demand as well. And now it's about repeating this program again and again and again to start growing the value of this company. And we're extremely excited and we think, uh, if we're on here a year from today, we'll have uh had a lot of headway in the scale that we were able to deploy and develop for our shareholders.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nMatt Hussey,Jason Nelson\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:40 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMETA\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts —self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps , that run without banks, governments, or big tech.\n\nWhen programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain —not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games , digital art , and assets worth billions.\nUltimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.\nThis guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.\nSmart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.\nSmart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.\n\nWho Invented Ethereum? Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.\n\nDevelopment of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nA crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.\n\nThe network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.\nThe switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work\nThis shift, known as “ The Merge ,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.\nBlocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhat applications have been built on Ethereum? 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.\n📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.\n💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.\n💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.\n💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.\n🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.\n\nTimeline: Major milestones in Ethereum Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.\nMid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.\nJuly 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.\nSeptember 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.\nMarch 2016: Homestead upgrade improves protocol security and usability.\nApril 2016: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, launches via crowdsale.\nJune 2016: Hackers exploit The DAO and drain roughly $50 million in Ether.

A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes . Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.\nThe first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack , but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.\n\nWhat Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?\nSince then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon , to investment collectives like Syndicate , and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO , which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.\nSupporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.\nA network tested by crisis If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.\nEthereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.\nThe community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nEthereum and the NFT boom Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.\nThe breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties , CryptoPunks , and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\nBy 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million , and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.\nEthereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nThe race to scale Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.\nTo address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 . The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.\n\nVitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'\nEthereum and the Web3 vision Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.\n\nBut competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana , Cardano , and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.\nEthereum and privacy In 2025, privacy has become a key focus of the Ethereum project. In November, Vitalik Buterin stated that \"Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene,\" building on a narrative in which he framed it as a fundamental requirement for digital systems such as blockchain platforms.\nEthereum Foundation Launches New Cluster Focused on Privacy\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has followed suit, launching a privacy cluster in October 2025 that includes 47 researchers, coordinators and cryptographers. The Foundation also launched Kohaku, a \"privacy-first\" toolkit for Ethereum, alongside a browser wallet and SDK. Upon its launch, Buterin commented that \"Full-stack privacy and security are first-class priorities in Ethereum.\"\nA decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.\nWhat’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

JPMorgan's 2026 outlook, backed by new CEO survey data, suggests markets are now recalibrating expectations — shifting focus from AI adoption to whether it actually delivers profits.\nGenAI Fell Short Of CEO Expectations PwC's latest global CEO survey, covering more than 4,700 executives across 109 countries, shows a clear expectation gap. While over 40% of CEOs entered 2025 expecting GenAI to boost revenue and nearly half anticipated a lift in profitability, only about one-third reported meaningful gains in either metric by year-end. Efficiency improvements were more visible, but even those undershot initial expectations.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nJPMorgan's interpretation isn't that AI spending was misplaced — it's that monetization arrived slower than anticipated. Adoption moved quickly, but translating that into top-line and margin expansion proved harder than forecasts implied.\nFrom Experimentation To ROI Discipline That gap is now changing behavior. JPMorgan notes that boards and CFOs are pressing harder on return on investment, favoring projects with clearer financial outcomes over open-ended experimentation. Growth alone is no longer enough; it needs to come with margin discipline.\nAs a result, valuation frameworks are tightening. Metrics like the Rule of 40 — and JPMorgan's stricter Rule of X — are reasserting themselves as filters rather than afterthoughts.\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nWhy 2026 Will Look Different The implication for 2026 is straightforward.

Uh, congrats on this big uh moment for your company.\n00:23 Speaker A\nWalk us through the the process a bit because I sense you have been very disciplined on arriving to this point. It was very very important for you to not make just a bad deal.\n00:39 Asher Ganoot\nWe think that the value of energy will continue to go up. And so for us, we had to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers but that drove a strong return to our shareholders. And so the announcement of our deal yesterday, we had actually two announcements. One was an announcement with Anthropic to have the opportunity to scale with them for 2,300 overall megawatts. Then the actual deal we signed itself that was $7 billion was only 330 megawatts, which is 245 megawatts of IT load.\n01:13 Asher Ganoot\nAnd so, for 245 megawatts of IT load, we announced a $7 billion deal that had a financial financial backstop with Google. And so, we're very, very excited because this is the first domino to fall. Um, if we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full uh strategic partnership on 2,300 megawatts, we see a lot of growth upside for the company. And the deal overall, not only did we announce that Google was creating a financial backstop, we had great partners like Fluidstack and Anthropic, but also that we had execution partners to deliver the data center.\n01:46 Asher Ganoot\nFrom JP Morgan to Goldman Sachs providing the financing, and to Jacob's Engineering and to Vertive providing the contracting and the supply chain.

For the average investor out there, Asher, why would an Anthropic need this much power? Break that down for us.\n02:14 Asher Ganoot\nThey're growing month over month. I mean, if you look at some of the public reports, their revenue has been increasing by billion dollars ARR every single month. And so as they continue to grow, they need additional compute to keep up with the demand of their users. And so they're one of the fastest growing companies in the world right now, and we'd like to provide the our first infrastructure layer to be able to allow them to keep up with that demand and continue to build out those models and those inference and training solutions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Charlie Munger Said, 'Find A Way To Get Your Hands On $100,000' Even If It Means Walking Everywhere — The Magic Number If You Want To Be Rich\n\nJeannine Mancini\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nCharlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

The 15 year, US$7.00 billion Fluidstack lease directly strengthens the near term catalyst of more predictable, infrastructure like cash flows, but it does not remove the key risks tied to Bitcoin exposure, project execution and the capital intensity of River Bend and other builds.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement is the Anthropic and Fluidstack partnership, which sets a framework for Hut 8 to deploy at least 245 MW and potentially up to 2,295 MW of AI data center capacity. That context matters for this lease because it links the River Bend campus to an identified AI tenant ecosystem, reinforcing the idea that Hut 8’s growth runway increasingly depends on executing large, complex AI and high performance computing projects alongside Bitcoin focused operations.\nYet the biggest risk investors should be aware of is how quickly execution or Bitcoin volatility could pressure...\nRead the full narrative on Hut 8 (it's free!)\nHut 8’s narrative projects $767.3 million in revenue and $140.6 million in earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Tesla’s ‘Musk Premium’ in Focus With SpaceX IPO in View\n\nJordan Fitzgerald\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nMU\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\n(Bloomberg) -- (Updates stock price after Thursday’s open)\nElon Musk is selling investors a future of driverless cars, robot assistants and life on Mars. The problem for investors is there’s only one way to buy into his vision: Tesla Inc.’s stock.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker’s shares were up nearly 3% on Thursday. They hit their first record of the year on Tuesday amid gains of more than 20% over the last four weeks. Since tumbling to a low on April 8 during the height of panic over the Trump administration’s tariffs, the stock has soared almost 120%, putting it among the 20 best performers in the S&P 500 Index.\nThe rally is a testament to Wall Street’s faith in Musk’s artificial intelligence ambitions, particularly since Tesla’s core auto business is struggling. But it has also made Tesla shares extremely expensive. At 214 times earnings over the next 12 months, the stock has the second highest valuation in the S&P 500, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and far ahead of number three, Palantir Technologies Inc., another high-flyer that trades at 178 times forward earnings as of Wednesday’s close.\n\n“The valuation doesn’t make any sense,” said Vikram Rai, portfolio manager and macro trader at First New York, which sold its Tesla position earlier this year after Musk and President Donald Trump had a very public fallout on social media.\nA Tesla representative didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nWith Musk’s SpaceX possibly going public next year, stock traders looking for “Elon exposure” will likely have another way to get it before long. The space exploration company is planning an insider share sale that would value it at $800 billion, making it the most expensive privately held business in the world. Its initial public offering would be the largest ever.\n\n“A SpaceX IPO could lead to some selling pressure on Tesla shares,” said Dmitry Shlyapnikov, an analyst at Horizon Investments who works with portfolio managers. “There are investors that own Tesla for exposure to Elon’s ideas and not for the car company attached to the ticker.”\nOf course, there’s another school of thought that a SpaceX public stock offering would shine a spotlight on Musk, giving Tesla another jolt of momentum.\n\nStory Continues\n“Historically, when one of Musk’s companies achieves a major milestone, it tends to lift sentiment for the others,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. “A high-profile SpaceX IPO could attract a fresh wave of investors who are drawn to his innovation story — and that enthusiasm often spills over into Tesla.”\n\nSo far, Tesla’s stock price is getting a boost from the hype surrounding SpaceX, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. The missions of the two companies are interlinked, he said, describing a future where Tesla’s Optimus robots help with Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, and SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system bolsters vehicle connectivity on Earth.\nThe companies also share lofty valuations. But Tesla skeptics question whether the company’s fundamentals can support those numbers. Its sales are slowing and profits are falling, while regulations rise and consumers spend less on cars.\n“If you’ve been long Tesla stock, you’ve made money, there’s no denying it,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, who has a small short position in Tesla. “It’s just bizarre to me because the fundamentals are so bad.”\n\n‘Double-Down on Elon’\nOptimists, on the other hand, point to Tesla’s growth prospects with opportunities in autonomous driving and robotaxis. Musk’s goal is to transform Tesla from an auto manufacturer to an artificial intelligence and robotics company. He wrote in a September X post that 80% of the firm’s profits will eventually come from robots.\n“We believe Tesla’s earnings are going to be growing at 30% to 35% over the next two to three years based on the innovation that they have in the automotive segment,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns the company’s shares.\nIf Musk can pull that off, Tesla’s stock market valuation would make more sense. If he can’t, that’s where SpaceX comes in. Publicly traded shares of SpaceX would give investors the opportunity to own a piece of Musk’s vision without Tesla’s baggage.\n\n“I think most investors will not want to double-down on Elon,” First New York’s Rai said. “That is a lot of risk to carry.”\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce disagrees.\n“We don’t see investors making an either/or choice, but instead backing both companies,” he said. “Investors that have made money in Tesla are likely to want to back another Musk venture.”\nFor now, the reality for investors is Tesla is the only way to bet on Musk’s vision. The immediate risk is the stock’s valuation, which is getting close to dangerous territory. On a technical level, the shares had been close to being considered overbought earlier this week. When they last reached that level in early October, the stock fell 10% over the next seven sessions.\n“In the short term, it’s probably ready for a bit of a cooling off type of period after having that all-time high,” Mulberry said.\n\nBut to long-term Musk believers, the valuation may indeed be a short-term concern. Over the next few years, however, many see Tesla as a buy regardless of the price — possibly even more than SpaceX.\n“I fully believe that at some point there will be a commercial mission to Mars, but probably not in my lifetime,” said Mulberry, who is 51 years old. “Does that mean I want to invest in that stock today? You’d have to have a really long view of that, whereas you could see the impact of robotaxis and robots probably in the next three to five years.”\nTop Tech News\nMicron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, a sign that surging demand and supply shortages are allowing the company to charge more for products.\nThe growing acrimony over the biggest deal in Hollywood is spilling into the open.

      "Content": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nKO\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Beverage behemoth Coca-Cola is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s longest-held and biggest positions.\nYou know Amazon as an e-commerce powerhouse, but that’s not quite what makes it such a promising long-term prospect.\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet has proven it’s willing and able to successfully build or acquire businesses that expand its digital consumer-facing ecosystem.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nThe end of an era is almost upon us. After 55 years at the helm, at the end of this year, Warren Buffett will be stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and chief stock-picker.\nAnd when he goes, many members of the investment community could find themselves at a loss. Although Berkshire isn't just a mutual fund, plenty of investors took Buffett's lead by copying Berkshire's trades; now the conglomerate's stock picks won't necessarily be Buffett-approved holdings. So, if you want to know for sure that you're following in his footsteps, you'd better act soon.\nTo this end, here's a rundown of three names currently in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio that you not only know the Oracle of Omaha likes well enough to own them, but each of which could safely be bought and held forever.\n1. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) isn't just one of Berkshire's longest-held positions at 19 years. It's also become the conglomerate's third-biggest holding, currently worth $28 billion. That's 10% of Berkshire's entire publicly traded portfolio.\nIt's not hard to see why Buffett's been such a long-term fan of the beverage giant, either. Not only is it the biggest and best-known name in the business, but it's a dividend machine! In addition to paying a dividend like clockwork for decades, The Coca-Cola Company has raised its per-share dividend payment for 63 consecutive years (and counting). This year, Berkshire's 400 million shares of KO will provide Buffett and his lieutenants with more than $200 million in cash. Never even mind the near-200% gain this stock's price alone has produced since Buffett first bought it back in late 2006.\n\nIt's also a great \"forever\" stock for two other reasons. One of these is simply that the world will always need something to drink. With brands like Gold Peak tea, Powerade sports drinks, Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, and, of course, its namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company has something to offer everyone.\nAnd the other reason this name's got staying power worth buying into? Its sheer size (read \"deep pockets\") -- the drinks giant can afford to outspend its competitors. For perspective, Coca-Cola spent more than $5 billion on advertising last year alone.\n\nStory Continues\nNo, it may not be fair. Investors don't want a fair fight, however. They want the companies they own to have an unfair advantage over their competition.\n2. Amazon Yes, Berkshire Hathaway holds a stake in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . It's not a big stake, mind you -- just 10 million shares currently worth about $2.2 billion. That's less than 1% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\nStill, the fact that he's willing to let Berkshire hold any Amazon at all is noteworthy just because Buffett has typically eschewed such flashy technology stocks, explaining that he doesn't always fully understand their business models. And to be sure, the pick was likely encouraged by Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler, who help oversee the conglomerate's equity holdings.\n\nThe pick also makes much more sense to Buffett now, however, than it would have several years ago.\nWhile Amazon may have been something of an unknown in its infancy (when the internet itself was still young and evolving, and when Buffett was forming his previous opinion on most technology stocks), even he would have to agree that uncertainty no longer applies. E-commerce is clearly here to stay, and Amazon clearly leads at least the U.S. e-commerce market; it isn't doing too badly overseas either. All told, despite its already-massive size, this company's product sales are up more than 8% through the first three quarters of this year. This growth rate accelerated last quarter, too, despite the lethargic economy here and abroad.\nAmazon isn't just e-commerce anymore, either. Although it only accounts for a minority of its revenue, its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, contributes roughly 60% of the company's total operating income. And the cloud computing industry is here to stay as well. Indeed, Straits Research expects the worldwide cloud computing industry to grow from less than $1 trillion this year to nearly $3.7 trillion per year by 2033.\n\nWhat makes this name such a great forever holding, however, is that -- not unlike Berkshire Hathaway itself -- Amazon has proven that it's willing and able to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace of opportunities.\n3. Alphabet Finally, add Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold forever for yourself.\nThere are actually several clear parallels between Berkshire's positions in Amazon and Alphabet. Both are holdings that wouldn't have likely even been considered as potential picks a few years ago, for instance, yet both businesses have clearly solidified in the meantime. Both companies are also flexible; Amazon added cloud computing to its repertoire several years ago and is now turning its online shopping platform into an advertising medium, while Alphabet has moved well beyond its Google search engine with profit centers like YouTube and its own cloud computing service. Berkshire doesn't exactly have a huge stake in either outfit, only holding 17.8 million shares currently worth about $5.5 billion. That's less than 2% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\n\nIt's also a pretty safe bet that this position is the result of prodding from Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.\nWhatever the case, Buffett's pseudo-endorsement of Alphabet serves as a green light of sorts for you, plugging you into the company that still handles 90% of the world's web searches (according to Statcounter).\nThat's not the chief reason Alphabet is such a great long-term bet, though. The biggest and best bullish argument here is a more philosophical one. That's Alphabet's willingness and ability to build or buy a business, anything that allows it to expand its digital ecosystem.\nYouTube is one example; Google acquired it back in 2006. Alphabet's chat-based artificial intelligence platform Gemini is another example, as is 2004's launch of Gmail and 2005's acquisition of mobile operating system Android, which Statcounter says is installed on 72% of the world's mobile devices.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" arm is home to developing self-driving taxi service Waymo and life-science outfit Verily.\nSome of these projects pan out. Others don't. There's a reason, however, that Alphabet has only failed to produce year-over-year quarterly revenue growth once in the past 10 years. That's the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 -- and that was a short-lived headwind. Its profit growth has been almost as persistent. There's no end in sight to this growth streak, either. There's just too much worldwide dependence on Alphabet's offerings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Trump Media is merging with fusion power company TAE Technologies in $6B+ deal\n\nTim De Chant, Amanda Silberling\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies , a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.\nThe all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.\n\nTMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch , the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”\nTMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.\nTruth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.\n\nTMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.\nBut the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.\nCurrently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion , are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.\n\nIf one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.\n\nOver the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.\nIn the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.\nAfter the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Trump Media and Technology Group will be the holding company for businesses including Truth Social platform, TAE Power Solutions and TAE Life Sciences.\n\nTrump Media shares jumped 33% in premarket trading, drawing traction on Stocktwits, a social media hub for retail investors. The money-losing company's stock has declined nearly 70% ​this year.\n\"TAE will also clearly have major political support from President Trump in our view,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.\nFUSION TECHNOLOGY\nCompanies and ‌physicists at national laboratories have been trying for decades to foster fusion reactions, in which light atoms are forced together under extreme temperatures to release huge amounts of energy, a process that fuels the sun.\nBig hurdles to commercialize fusion include getting more energy out of a reaction than what goes into it and developing plants that can withstand streams of fusion reactions to power the grid.\n\nTAE CEO Binderbauer and other fusion company leaders met with U.S. Energy Department officials this month, weeks after the department formed its first ever fusion ⁠office.\nThe company, which has raised more than $1.3 billion in private funding, is aiming ​to develop and sell next‑generation neutral beam systems for fusion and related applications ​in a more cost‑effective manner.\n\nStory Continues\nTrump Media has agreed to provide up to $200 million in cash to TAE at signing and $100 million more upon initial filing of the registration.

      "Content": "AI data centers are eating the memory industry, and it could hurt your wallet\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 5:09 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSSNLF\n\n000660.KS\n\nMemory maker Micron ( MU ) reported a blowout first quarter earnings report on Wednesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines and offering a better-than-anticipated outlook for the second quarter, as data center builders look to grab as much of the company's memory chips as possible.\nMicron builds memory, known as DRAM, for data centers. And as data center construction booms in the US, that memory is selling at a premium.\n\nThere's just one problem: DRAM is also used in devices like smartphones and laptops.\nConsumer PCs and other systems use a type of DRAM called double data rate memory (DDR), while data centers use a version of DRAM called high-bandwidth memory, HBM.\nDRAM suppliers are currently focusing more on building HBM than DRAM, thanks to higher margins on data center parts. And that's starving the broader market.\nIt's not just PC buyers who are feeling the sting, either. Everything from cars to medical equipment could be impacted by the dearth of memory chips.\nCompounding that is the fact that, ahead of its earnings, Micron announced that it is exiting the consumer memory business to focus on providing memory to AI data centers.\n\"It's not going to be good for consumers, because it's driving prices up, and very soon,” Ryan Reith, group vice president for IDC's worldwide device tracker, told Yahoo Finance.\nA massive memory crunch While most of us tend to think of GPUs powering AI data centers, they're only part of the server clusters that run apps like OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) ChatGPT and Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Gemini. In addition to CPUs and storage, they also need large pools of memory.\nThe problem? There are only a few major memory manufacturers in the world. That includes big-name companies like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron ( MU ). And the incredible demand for data center equipment is driving up prices across the entire industry.\n\nAccording to Reuters , Samsung has increased the prices of some memory by as much as 60%. Enthusiast site PCPartPicker , which tracks the prices of various memory sticks, shows the cost of some memory climbing from $100 to nearly $450.\n\"I think the general consensus is that in the last month … this has gotten a lot more attention, and not in a positive way,\" Reith said, adding that the price impact will likely end up getting passed through to consumers, especially on low-cost laptops.\nThat's because companies that produce entry-level and midrange systems have less room to maneuver when it comes to pricing before they completely eat through their margins.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"All of those things are essentially PCs. Any embedded device, game consoles, specialized medical equipment, those are all embedded computers, and they all have memory, and they all have storage of some kind,\" TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut memory companies don't necessarily mind if there's a shortage of components for PCs and other systems as long as they're raking in cash on HBM, especially because the margins on HBM are higher than other types of memory.\nThere are some ways device makers can try to offset the increased price of memory, including using cheaper, less powerful components elsewhere in their products or putting pressure on suppliers to reduce costs, explained Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.\nThis isn't the first time the tech industry has had to contend with memory supply problems, however. It is, after all, a notoriously cyclical market.\n\"What happens is, there's huge demand, and capacity gets built out, but it's never smooth,\" O'Donnell said.\n\n\"So … you get to the point where all demand gets sucked up, so you build these new factories, then you end up with a ton more capacity, and then the prices drop precipitously because there's too much capacity,\" he added.\nBut with so many companies building data centers across the globe, it's difficult to tell when the memory market will come back down.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The group plans to spend $1 billion on credits between 2022 and 2030.\nIts latest deal covers 122,000 metric tons of CO2 to be locked away ​between 2026 and 2030 by NULIFE GreenTech, which converts agricultural and ‌industrial waste - including grease from food processing - into bio-oil. The credits were purchased at an average weighted price of $362 per ton.\nNULIFE uses high-pressure cooking to break down waste into substances such as bio-oil, which is injected into salt caverns more than 1,000 metres underground ⁠for permanent storage. Frontier estimates the ​technology could scale to 1.5 gigatons of ​carbon removal annually by 2040.\n\"The goal at Frontier is really to create a portfolio of solutions that we ‍think are most ⁠likely to go the distance to a gigaton scale future,\" Hannah Bebbington Valori, Frontier’s head of deployment, said in an interview.\nScientists ⁠say carbon removal projects are critical to offset emissions from sectors that continue ‌to rely on fossil fuels.\n(Reporting by Simon Jessop and ‌Susanna Twidale.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided.

      "Content": "Got $1,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nORCL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia boasts of exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\nAlphabet’s full-stack AI approach is proving to be a key competitive advantage.\nIonQ can prove to be a high-growth, high-risk addition to a large and well-diversified investment portfolio.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe Federal Reserve's much-awaited 25-basis-point interest rate cut, announced on Dec. 10, has not delivered the market relief many investors had hoped for. While tech stocks initially jumped, the optimism was quickly replaced as renewed concerns around artificial intelligence (AI)-powered stocks resurfaced. Investor sentiment has further deteriorated after AI cloud giant Oracle missed earnings estimates in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Nov. 30, 2025), raising concerns about its ability to convert high-level capital investment into sustained profits.\nWith markets swinging sharply in response to changing sentiment, long-term investors can convert today's uncertainty into an entry opportunity. In case you have $1,000 not required to pay bills and debt or kept aside for contingencies, then investing in any of these three stocks can help generate wealth in the long run.\n\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might seem like the most obvious buy-and-hold pick for decades, and for good reason.\nThe company's exceptional long-term order visibility, worth nearly $500 billion of Blackwell and Rubin systems through 2025 and 2026, is itself a strong indicator of the durability of its long-term growth trajectory. While $150 billion in orders have already shipped, $350 billion worth of orders remain. Nvidia has expanded its strategic partnership with Saudi Public Investment Fund-backed AI company HUMAIN to jointly deploy up to 600,000 of its latest GPU systems over the next three years. This, coupled with a new compute capacity supply agreement with Anthropic, has expanded Nvidia's multiyear demand in addition to the $500 billion.\n\nThe reopening of the Chinese market is also a significant growth catalyst, considering that Nvidia once earned nearly 20% to 25% of its data center revenue from this market. Recently, the U.S. government approved the export of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, provided that 25% of the revenue is paid to the U.S. Treasury. According to a Reuters report, the company has informed Chinese clients that it is evaluating options to expand H200 chip production to meet the surging demand. While the Chinese government has yet to formally approve the purchases of these chips, the report notes that several Chinese technology companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already contacted Nvidia to secure supply.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the stellar demand, visibility, and expanding market access, Nvidia stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 23 and a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.48. While the stock may experience short-term volatility due to changes in hyperscaler spending and policy shifts, its long-term growth story remains intact. Hence, investors should be picking up a stake in this stock, especially at its current reasonable valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has also become a crucial player in the global development of AI infrastructure. The company exited the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025) with a Google Cloud backlog of $155 billion, up 46% on a sequential basis. Customers also entered into a larger number of deals valued at over $1 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared to the combined total of the previous two years. Additionally, nearly 70% of the company's cloud customers are already using the company's AI products.\n\nThe rapid pace of enterprise adoption and improved multiyear revenue visibility of Google Cloud can be partly attributed to the company's full-stack AI strategy, spanning AI infrastructure, proprietary chips, AI models, and enterprise platforms. The full-stack approach is helping Google Cloud support large-scale AI deployments more efficiently. This, in turn, is contributing to improving margins and deepening existing customer relationships.\nBeyond Cloud, Alphabet's strategy of embedding AI across its ecosystem is also delivering strong results. AI experiences are already driving higher engagement in Search through AI Mode and AI Overviews. The company is seeing a higher number of overall queries, including commercial queries, which present additional avenues for monetization. YouTube is also benefiting from AI-driven recommendation systems and is witnessing robust double-digit revenue growth from advertising and subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet is generating durable cash flows from its consumer products, while Google Cloud is well positioned to ride the multiyear enterprise AI wave. The company trades at 27.6 times forward earnings, which appears rich. However, considering its scale, diversified revenue base, and technological edge, Alphabet can be a solid long-term pick even at an elevated valuation level.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is too speculative to serve as a core holding in a diversified portfolio. However, this quantum computing specialist could still merit a small allocation for investors seeking exposure to its long-term growth optionality or those growth drivers that cannot be fully modeled.\nIonQ has delivered exceptional top-line performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), with revenue soaring 222% year over year to $39.9 million, exceeding even the upper end of its own guidance by 37%. IonQ also has $3.5 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet, allowing the company to invest in future growth initiatives.\n\nManagement has highlighted multiple technical and product-specific milestones. The company successfully deployed its #AQ 64 Tempo system (capable of running large and complex quantum circuits) three months ahead of schedule and achieved a record two-qubit fidelity of 99.99% (meaning the system executes two-qubit operations correctly 99.99% of the time).\nIonQ is focused on expanding its presence beyond quantum computing, into associated areas, such as quantum networking, sensing, and security, through targeted acquisitions, including that of Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, and a controlling stake in ID Quantique. The company is also exploring commercialization opportunities through large-scale solutions-based contracts and a land-and-expand strategy. The company is thus striving to build long-term and sticky client relationships.\n\nStill, investors should remain aware of IonQ's risks, considering that the company is loss-making and incurring significant expenses on innovation. IonQ stock trades at 208.3 times sales, which is also very rich. Yet, the stock can be a good addition provided it does not exceed 5% of a large diversified portfolio.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?
