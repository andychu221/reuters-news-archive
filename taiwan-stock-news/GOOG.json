      "Content": "Google started the year behind in the AI race. It ended 2025 on top.\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:03 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nCRM\n\nGoogle ( GOOG , GOOGL ) entered 2025 in a difficult position. While its stock price rose 36% in 2024, the company was still largely perceived by Wall Street as playing second (or third) fiddle to OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) in the AI race.\nFast-forward to today, and Google is stealing the show, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a \"code red\" emergency as the company works to match Google's latest Gemini 3 AI models. It's an interesting twist, given that Google declared its own code red after ChatGPT hit the market in 2022.\n\nGoogle is also catching up to OpenAI in the key monthly active user (MAU) metric.\nThen there are Google chip wins. In October, Claude developer Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) announced it was expanding its plan to use Google's AI chips, including using up to 1 million processors , to power its AI software.\nGoogle is also in talks to provide its chips to Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta ( META ) to run its AI products, according to The Information .\nIt all added up to a strong 2025 for the search giant, setting it up for continued success in the year ahead.\n\"Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in CY26,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a Dec. 11 investor note.\n\"Google is in the strongest position when it comes to a fully integrated AI stack,\" he wrote. \"Gemini is a leading model, its user base is expanding faster than OpenAI's, Search is integrating AI effectively with ads reportedly on the way, and [Google Cloud Platform] continues to hold its ground in the infrastructure buildout cycle.\"\n\nGoogle's AI wins pile up Google counts its AI revenue as part of its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) business. According to the company, that has given GCP a significant boost. In Q3, Google said its GCP revenue grew 34% year over year to $15.1 billion . It rose 32% in the prior quarter.\nThe number of new customers to the GCP jumped 34%.\n\n\"Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.\nAccording to Pichai, Google signed more deals worth more than $1 billion in its third quarter than it did in the previous two years combined. More than 70% of the company's existing cloud customers are using its AI services, he added.\nThe company has also more deeply intertwined its AI capabilities with Google Search, launching its ChatGPT-like AI Mode for all US users in May at the Google I/O conference and dropping ads into AI Overviews in search.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle has also managed to win over social media users with its Nano Banana AI image app, which went viral in August. Then came the biggest bomb: Gemini 3.\nAnnounced in November , Gemini 3 immediately won praise from users, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who said he was ditching ChatGPT after using the app for Gemini 3.\n\nGemini 3 sent shockwaves through the AI industry, unseating GPT-5.1 as the leading AI model across several categories.\nGoogle's user base is also growing. According to TD Cowen's John Blackledge, a survey of roughly 2,500 US consumers found that Gemini's MAU penetration ramped faster than ChatGPT's from July to October.\nGemini MAU penetration was 24% in July and climbed to 26% in October. Google's AI Mode also improved from 18% to 19%. ChatGPT, however, saw its MAU penetration decline from 36% to 35% in the same time period.\n\nMarket intelligence firm Sensor Tower says that both apps continue to see significant growth, with global MAU up 180% and 125% for ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively. But like TD Cowen, Sensor Tower found that ChatGPT's MAU grew roughly 15% between August and December. Gemini was up 30%, thanks in part to its Nano Banana image editing app.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that Gemini is also available on all newer Android devices, making it far easier to access than ChatGPT, which requires users to navigate to a website or download the ChatGPT app.\nGoogle's other beats AI wasn't the only bright spot for Google in 2025. While the company lost its second antitrust case in April, with a judge finding it holds an illegal monopoly through its online advertising business, its legal issues weren't all bad.\nIn September, a judge declined to force Google to give up its Chrome browser after he found the company holds an illegal monopoly over the search market.\nThe judge also allowed Google to continue to make payments to \"distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or GenAI products.\"\nThat means the company can continue to pay Apple upwards of $20 billion a year to make Google Search the default search option on its iPhone and other devices.\n\nOutside of its legal dramas, Google has also made major strides with self-driving car company Waymo. The firm expanded its availability to other cities — including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando — and began offering freeway driving around San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\nGoogle also showed off its prototype smart glasses and a new Samsung VR headset, both of which use software based on a version of Android called Android XR, which was developed by Google and Samsung.\nLook for that and more in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Nvidia vs Alphabet: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Nvidia and Alphabet are set to be the top-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in 2025.\nNvidia is expected to continue seeing strong growth in 2026 as AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up.\nThe network effect of Apple's vertical AI model should really start to shine through next year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe two top-performing \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks in 2025 were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . As of this writing, Nvidia's stock is up around 30%, while Alphabet has turned in a 60% gain.\nLet's see which stock is poised to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Nvidia Where artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending heads, Nvidia's stock is likely to follow. The company is the dominant player in the space with its graphics processing units (GPUs), and while competition has increased, no one is close to unseating the king. It still has a wide moat with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code has been written, while its recent acquisition of SchedMD will only help widen its software moat.\nMeanwhile, its NVLink interconnect system helps prevent vendor mixing and matching because it's a proprietary system that lets its GPUs quickly pass along data and pool memory, allowing an AI cluster to act as a single powerful unit.\nMeanwhile, the setup for the company looks attractive heading into 2026. All the major cloud computing companies have discussed ramping up data center capex spending next year, which bodes well for it. At the same time, the U.S. just gave it the green light to start selling its H200 chip to commercial Chinese customers, reopening a big market for it. In addition, large customer OpenAI is close to closing $100 billion in new funding, which should help it with its aggressive AI data center buildout.\n\nOn top of that, Nvidia's stock is attractively valued, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 23 times 2026 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.7 times. Positive PEGs below 1 are generally viewed as undervalued.\nThe case for Alphabet Alphabet's biggest advantage is that it is the one major hyperscaler (owner of large data centers) that isn't largely reliant on Nvidia. The company developed its own custom AI chips over a decade ago, and today most of its internal workloads are run on its tensor processing units (TPUs). That has given the company both a cost advantage with its cloud computing business, as well as with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Cloud has been a huge growth driver for Alphabet, and that should only continue in 2026 as the unit has been capacity-constrained. Alphabet has been spending aggressively, which should result in Google Cloud's growth accelerating. Alphabet also made an under-the-radar move the past couple of years with its chips that could lead to big growth.\n\nTPUs were originally designed for Google Cloud's TensorFlow framework, but Alphabet shifted its chips to be more framework agnostic, including supporting the popular PyTorch framework. This move allows it to rent out its TPUs to other companies. Anthropic is one of the first companies to jump on this opportunity, agreeing to deploy $21 billion in TPUs. Morgan Stanley has estimated that for every 500,000 TPUs deployed, Alphabet will generate around $13 billion in annual revenue. It's currently projecting the company will rent out 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has trained its top-tier Gemini model on its TPUs, while it also runs inference with them. This gives it a significant cost advantage over competitors like OpenAI, allowing it to continue investing more money in its model and further improve it.\n\nIt also has the advantage of being able to integrate Gemini throughout its products, making them better. It essentially has what can be referred to as a \"surface advantage,\" bringing AI to the places where people already are, rather than relying on stand-alone apps and third-party integrations. These advantages should just continue to grow and drive revenue in 2026 and beyond.\nThe verdict I think Nvidia and Alphabet should both have strong years in 2026. Both stocks are attractively valued with forward P/Es of 23 times and 27 times, respectively, and both should produce strong revenue growth.\nHowever, of the two, I think Alphabet's stock will once again outperform in 2026. It has a more durable business (it's less cyclical and doesn't rely on heavy customer capex spending), and I think the network effects of its model will really start to shine through next year, powering the stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Stock Market News for Dec 23, 2025\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nGOOGL\n\nNVDA\n\nXLU\n\n^DJI\n\nU.S. stock markets closed higher on Monday to start the Christmas week. Wall Street generally remains positive in the last two truncated trading weeks of any year with muted volumes. This year, market participants&rsquo; confidence has received a boost from renewed momentum in the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. All three major stock indexes ended in positive territory.\n\nHow Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) advanced 0.5% or 227.79 points to close at 48,362.68 Notably, 20 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 10 finished in negative territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 23,428.83, rising 0.5% or 121.21 points on the strong performance of AI bigwigs.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained 0.6% points to finish at 6,878.49. Six out of 11 broad-sectors of the broad-market index ended in positive territory while four ended in negative territory and one remained unchanged. The technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) rose 2.2%. On the other hand, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) fell 1.3%.\n\nThe fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 5.6% to 14.08, marking its lowest closing since Dec. 13, 2024. A total of 14.57 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 16.9 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.15-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.\n\nAI Trade Continues to Thrive The AI saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nGoldman Sachs and Bank of America projected that AI infrastructure capex spending will cross $1 trillion in 2028. JP Moran and Citigroup forecast this figure to total $5 trillion cumulative in 2030. Research firm McKinsey & Co. estimated that global AI-powered data center infrastructure capex will reach around $7 trillion by 2030.\n\nFour of the &ldquo;magnificent 7&rdquo; stocks have decided to invest a massive $380 billion in 2025 as capital expenditure for AI-infrastructure development. This marks a significant 54% year-over-year increase in capital spending on the AI ecosystem. Moreover, these companies have also said that AI capex is likely to increase handsomely in 2026.\n\nLatest Developments on AI Space The Trump administration has decided to allow the generative AI chipset behemoth NVIDIA Corp. NVDA to sell its high-end H200 AI chips to some &ldquo;approved customers&rdquo; in China. Reuters reported that NVIDIA is considering shipment of H200 chips to China from mid-February 2026. The H200 chip is two generations behind NVDA&rsquo;s current Blackwell Ultra processors.\n\nReuters reported that the initial shipment will consist of around 40,000 to 80,000 H200 chips. Several investment banks have estimated that the resumption of sales in China could bring back around $10 to $20 billion in revenues per calendar year for the company.\n\nAlphabet Inc. GOOGL has decided to acquire data center and energy infrastructure company, Intersect, for a consideration of $4.75 billion in cash. In addition, Alphabet will assume the debts of Intersect. Alphabet expects the deal to bring more data center and generation capacity online faster.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said, &ldquo;Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive U.S. innovation and leadership.&rdquo;\n\nThe stock prices of NVIDIA and Alphabet rose 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively.

      "Content": "Could This Be the Next Stock to Join the Likes of Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon in the $1 Trillion Club?\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:09 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Oracle is building hundreds of data centers to meet demand for computing capacity from artificial intelligence developers.\nThe company's order backlog is over $500 billion, but investors are worried that it won't all convert into revenue.\nOracle was a stone's throw away from joining the $1 trillion club just a few months ago.\n10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›\n\nThe U.S. economy has a history of producing the world's most valuable companies. United States Steel became the first $1 billion enterprise on the planet in 1901, and 117 years later, in 2018, iPhone maker Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone.\nEight other U.S. companies have since joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club, including Nvidia , Alphabet , Amazon , and Tesla . It looked as though Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was set to join them back in September as its market capitalization peaked at $940 billion, but following a 41% decline in its stock price since then, the company is now valued at just $550 billion.\nRecent stock price performance aside, artificial intelligence (AI) developers are lining up to rent access to Oracle's data center infrastructure, which is fueling a surge in the company's revenues. Could it be only a matter of time before this tech titan charts a path back toward $1 trillion?\nA leader in AI infrastructure Most AI development happens inside large, centralized data centers fitted with tens of thousands of advanced parallel processors -- many of them graphics processing units ( GPUs ) supplied by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It can cost billions of dollars to build a single data center, and since most businesses don't have that kind of money to dedicate to such endeavors, they rent computing capacity from specialized operators like Oracle instead.\n\nOracle's data center infrastructure is among the best in the industry. It uses proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology that moves data between chips and devices more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, even minor increases in processing speed can result in major cost savings over time.\nOracle's data centers also offer significant scale, enabling developers to tap into clusters of over 131,000 GPUs, which is enough to handle even the most advanced AI workloads.\nMoreover, it's bringing capacity online at a rapid pace. As of the conclusion of its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended Nov. 30), Oracle had 147 data center regions up and running with 64 more in the pipeline. OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech juggernauts using Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue is soaring Oracle generated $16.1 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2026 second quarter, which was a modest 14% increase from the prior-year period. But revenue from its cloud infrastructure segment, specifically, soared by 66% to a record $4.1 billion.\nThe cloud infrastructure unit could be growing its sales even faster, but Oracle simply can't build data centers fast enough to meet demand. That's why the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) rocketed by a whopping 438% year over year to $523 billion during the quarter. RPO is like an order backlog, because it reflects the value of signed contracts with customers for services that haven't been delivered yet.\n\nAround $300 billion of Oracle's RPO is reportedly from one customer, OpenAI, which creates concentration risk. OpenAI is still a fairly young company, and it doesn't have anywhere close to $300 billion in cash on hand. Unless it becomes a raging financial success, this enormous commitment might never convert into revenue for Oracle.\nSkepticism about this deal is part of the reason Oracle stock has plummeted in the past few months. The company has around $108 billion in debt, and it's taking on even more to fund the construction of more data centers. The possibility that one of its top customers might never have the money to rent all of the capacity it has requested is spooking investors.\nWill Oracle join the $1 trillion club? Oracle generated earnings of $5.32 per share over the last four quarters on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, which gives its stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.1. That is a premium to the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so even though Oracle stock has tumbled, it still isn't cheap.\nFrom its market cap of about $550 billion today, Oracle's stock would have to soar by 82% for the company to join the $1 trillion club. If we assume Oracle's P/E ratio remains exactly where it is right now, the company would have to nearly double its earnings per share to justify that type of share price gain. If its P/E ratio declines further, it will have an even steeper mountain to climb.\n\nOracle's AI business is growing at a lightning-fast pace right now, so there's a good chance the company will join the $1 trillion club at some point, but it probably won't be the next member inducted. Several other U.S. companies are much closer to the mark: Walmart has a market cap of $911 billion, and JPMorgan Chase is also in range at $872 billion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now? Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "My Top 3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in December\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Alphabet's Google Quantum AI is addressing nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing.\nAmazon's Ocelet chip holds the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of quantum error correction.\nMicrosoft's topoconductors could represent a giant leap forward in building large-scale quantum computers.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\n\"Plastics.\"\nThat's the one-word advice that Mr. McGuire (played by Walter Brooke) gave to Dustin Hoffman's character, Benjamin Braddock, in the classic 1967 movie The Graduate . If the movie were remade today, though, McGuire might have to use two words in his investing recommendation to young Braddock – quantum computing .\nQuantum computing is poised to profoundly reshape the technological landscape over the next few years. Importantly, it presents tremendous opportunities for investors today. I think that some opportunities stand out above others, though. Here are my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is best known as the parent company of Google. And Google, of course, is best known for its ubiquitous search engine. However, Google is also working to advance quantum computing.\nGoogle Quantum AI officially began operating in 2012. Its mission, then and now, is to 'build quantum computing for otherwise unsolvable problems.\"\n\nTo achieve this lofty goal, Google Quantum AI covers nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing . Its staff work on both hardware (including quantum processors and cooling systems called cryostats) and software (including operating systems and user applications).\nThus far, Google Quantum AI has completed two of the six milestones on its roadmap to build a practical, large-scale quantum computer. In 2019, Google Quantum AI announced that its technology achieved quantum supremacy (a term used to describe where a quantum computer solves a problem that would take classical supercomputers a significantly long time to handle). In 2023, its team unveiled the first logical qubit prototype that demonstrated quantum error correction.\n2. Amazon You may have also heard about my second quantum computing stock. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reigns as the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce and cloud services. The company is also an important player in quantum computing.\nIn one sense, Amazon is a \"picks-and-shovels\" play in quantum computing. Amazon Braket is a quantum cloud computing service that's available on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It supports researchers in developing quantum computing algorithms, testing quantum hardware, and creating quantum software.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Amazon isn't just operating on the sidelines in the quantum computing arena. The company is also busy developing its own quantum technology. In February 2025, Amazon announced a new quantum computing chip called Ocelet.\nOcelet could be a key breakthrough in the goal to build large-scale quantum computers. The chip can reduce the costs of quantum error correction by up to 90% versus current approaches. It uses \"cat-qubits\" (named after physicist Erwin Schrödinger's famous quantum thought experiment, which featured a cat) that can suppress some types of quantum computing errors.\n\n3. Microsoft My third pick is also a household name. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a technology giant with products including the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office 365 productivity software, and Xbox gaming systems. Like Alphabet and Amazon, Microsoft is also investing heavily in quantum computing.\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform offers a \"Quantum Ready\" program. This program helps leaders develop strategies to mitigate the potential negative impact of quantum computing on their organizations while leveraging the opportunities that quantum computing presents.\n\nArguably, the most crucial quantum computing initiative for Microsoft is its topological core architecture. This architecture utilizes topological superconductors, also known as topoconductors, which are a special type of matter that falls neither into the solid, liquid, nor gas states.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced the first quantum computing chip that uses topoconductors – Majorana 1. Microsoft believes the technology used in Majorana 1 presents a key step toward fitting 1 million or more qubits on a single chip.\nCommon denominators You may have noticed several commonalities among my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December. They're all so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. They all operate widely used cloud platforms. All three companies are leaders in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlso, none of them are pure-play quantum computing companies. I think that's critical. No one knows for sure which quantum technologies will emerge as the biggest winners. Investing in a single pure-play quantum computing stock could be a highly risky proposition.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have ample financial flexibility to acquire smaller rivals that show exceptional promise. If you want to profit from quantum computing but not take on a significant amount of risk, these megacap stocks are the way to go, in my opinion.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\n\nAmin Ayan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIBIT\n\nBLK\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nBlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025, ranking the product alongside Treasury bills and US mega-cap technology stocks.\nKey Takeaways:\nBlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech.\nIBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\nThe fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025.\nThe performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand.\n\nNate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.\nThe latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival.\nBlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "This Nuclear Stock Could Turn $1,000 Into $100,000\n\nSteven Porrello, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:25 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OKLO\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Oklo is a pre-revenue nuclear start-up that needs a NRC license to turn its idea into profits.\nThe company's microreactors could be a billion dollar idea if data center demand stays hot.\nTo grow one-hundred-fold, Oklo would have to become a trillion dollar company, which would likely only happen over a long period.\n10 stocks we like better than Oklo ›\n\nEarly investors in Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) who held on to their shares through the flat and rocky months of 2024 have seen a triple-digit gain since last year.\nIndeed, after losing more than 50% on its first day of trading (May 10, 2024), Oklo stock has rebounded more than tenfold, beating heavyweight AI favorites, like Nvidia , Palantir , Alphabet , and Microsoft , plus the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the same period.\nPut differently: If you had invested $10,000 in Oklo near the end of its May 10 debut, you would have about $100,000 right now. At one point in October, that same holdings would have been worth well over $200,000.\nWith a 280% gain on the year, Oklo may seem like old news. And yet if you believe in the future of artificial intelligence (AI), this stock's incredible run may only be the beginning.\nCan Oklo turn $1,000 into $100,000? Oklo isn't your average nuclear company.\nThe Sam Altman-backed start-up is designing a microreactor (\"Aurora powerhouse\") that can supply on-site power to remote areas.\nUnlike traditional nuclear power plants, which are expensive and can take a decade to finish building, Oklo's Auroras are factory-built and can be deployed faster than large reactors. That makes them ideal for data center operators, who often build in rural areas where grid power would be severely strained by their electricity needs.\n\nBut here's something to consider: If Oklo turns $1,000 into $100,000, it would join the trillion-dollar club. That's a pretty tall order for any start-up, let alone one that will operate in the utilities sector.\nWhile a one-hundred-fold gain isn't impossible, it would likely take years, if not decades, to happen. Meanwhile, the utilities sector is expected to grow only about 5% annually. Even if Oklo can turn on its first plants, it would need to scale beyond that utility sector growth.\nAt this point, I'd size an Oklo position small; if its reactors work, it could matter over the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oklo right now? Before you buy stock in Oklo, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oklo wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "1 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy With $1,000 in December and Hold for the Long Term\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is benefiting from the growth of AI, giving it excellent chances heading into 2026.\nIt works with 500 partners and powers 12,000 different products.\nThe company reports fourth-quarter results in January.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been an incredible market driver in 2025. Large companies , such as Nvidia and Alphabet, are enjoying strong gains, while companies like Palantir Technologies and CoreWeave are attracting investor attention and gaining at even faster rates.\nIt remains to be seen whether this trend will continue in 2026, but it appears likely. If you have $1,000 available to invest and are looking for a top AI stock to buy right now, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is a no-brainer.\nThe foundation of all AI What sets Taiwan Semi apart from almost any other AI stock is that it manufactures the chips designed by other companies. It's the manufacturer for the brand names, the foundation of their development. It's not the only game in town, but it developed the industry, and it's the biggest: It's been responsible for around 85% of semiconductor start-up product prototypes, and it has a 34% market share in the foundry business, which enables the fabrication of semiconductors.\n\nIt has contracts with nearly all the chip designers that are changing the world through AI. These are names like Nvidia, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices . These companies are continually developing more powerful chips, and their trusted partner, Taiwan Semiconductor, is experiencing strong growth as a result.\nAs hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft pour billions of dollars into data centers and AI development, they require more chips. Regardless of which chipmaker they're working with, they're likely to count on TSMC as a partner at some point.\nThe company has expanded its operations and now has a U.S. presence in Arizona. The very first chip that came off the line was an Nvidia Blackwell chip in October, marking a significant win for both companies. It's already investing $165 billion in Arizona alone, and it's looking to expand into new U.S. facilities over the next few years, setting itself up for many years of growth. This is an important development, not only because it expands the company's capabilities, but it also allows it to get around the tariffs that have been so challenging for many companies doing business in the U.S. recently.\n\nStory Continues\nMore than AI Aside from its client diversification, which is an excellent feature, it's also diversified by industry. It's benefiting from the tailwinds of AI growth, but it has been around a lot longer than the recent AI craze. It manufactures chips for various types of technology, including smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and AI. It works with 500 companies, and its semiconductors power 12,000 different products.\n\nHowever, AI is definitely giving the company a big boost. High-performance computing, which includes AI products, accounted for 57% of total revenue in the third quarter. Total revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% since going public in 1994. That is an outstanding performance, and it has accelerated recently; revenue was up 40.8% year over year in the third quarter. However, its highest-growing industries are Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphones.\nA stock price that's ready to jump A great stock is one that you can buy any time; the earlier the better. Taiwan Semiconductor has tremendous growth drivers and opportunities, making it a no-brainer choice for long-term growth.\nHowever, December appears to be an auspicious time to buy shares, as the stock has remained relatively stable over the past few months and is up 46% year to date. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings in January, and the stock is likely to jump on positive results, giving you the chance to buy in before the next rise.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Alphabet\n\nRobert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Alphabet were criticized for their AI results to date, but they are turning that around.\nApple delivered record revenue in its 2025 fiscal year and brought on new AI leadership.\nAlphabet's application of AI is driving growth across its businesses, such as increased usage of its search engine.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nTech titans Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) were rivals during the rise of the smartphone era. However, the arrival of a new technological marvel, artificial intelligence (AI) , has led to the pair teaming up.\nNews reports indicate Apple is going to license Alphabet's Gemini AI model to power its Siri voice assistant at a cost of $1 billion annually. This would be a win for Alphabet, whose stock has been a boon for shareholders as the share price soared nearly 60% in 2025 through Dec. 18. In that time, Apple stock was up about 9%.\nThat said, Apple shares hit an all-time high of $288.62 on Dec. 3, despite previous media perceptions that it's an AI laggard. So, which of these tech goliaths will prove the superior investment amid the age of AI? Let's dig into both companies to find out.\nApple's steady AI push Apple proved the AI revolution is a marathon, not a sprint, when it wrapped up its 2025 fiscal year, ended Sept. 27, with record revenue, despite a choppy push into artificial intelligence. The company reported sales of $416.2 billion, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nThis result was helped by record revenue of $102.5 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, which contributed to strong 13% year-over-year growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.85. The performance shows Apple didn't need a splashy AI solution to sell products.\n\nHowever, the company realizes its artificial intelligence offerings must continue to improve. It brought in new AI leadership in December, replacing its head of AI strategy with Amar Subramanya. Subramanya comes to Apple with years of experience helping Microsoft and Alphabet build their artificial intelligence capabilities. About this switch, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said, \"We believe that this was a major reset ... to get Apple on the right track when it comes to AI.\"\nEven so, the company is already viewed as a rival in the AI space. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, called Apple a major competitor. He sees hardware that supports AI, rather than software, as the battleground for artificial intelligence leadership.\nIn this regard, Apple is making strides. In October, it released the M5 chip, which was designed to deliver the kind of powerful computing performance needed to support AI on its devices.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet's intensified AI focus Like Apple, fellow tech titan Alphabet was seen as struggling to succeed in artificial intelligence after early stumbles in the space. The Google parent made changes to its organization last year to improve its AI approach.\nThis effort culminated in the November launch of the company's Gemini 3, its most advanced AI yet. The new artificial intelligence model can pick up subtle clues, allowing it to better understand the intent behind a user's Google search.\n\nWhile Gemini 3's impact won't be known until Q4 results are announced in 2026, the company is already benefiting from its AI efforts to date. According to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, \"AI is driving an expansionary moment for Search,\" explaining that the AI embedded in Google \"is already driving incremental total query growth for Search.\"\nConsequently, Google search revenue hit $56.6 billion in Q3, an increase from $49.4 billion in 2024. This helped Alphabet grow Q3 sales by 16% year over year to $102.3 billion.\nThat's just the start. AI acts as the brains behind many Alphabet products, including its self-driving car business, Waymo. Here, \"Waymo clearly is scaling up, particularly in 2026,\" Pichai said. Its service is expanding to London next year, adding to its Tokyo operations, which were Waymo's first steps internationally.\n\nPicking between Apple and Alphabet stocks Apple and Alphabet still have many years of growth to look forward to in the hot field of artificial intelligence. The AI industry is projected to achieve a phenomenal 25-fold expansion within a decade, growing from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033.\nGiven their proven revenue growth in the face of AI competition, such as ChatGPT, investing in both companies is ideal. But if you had to choose one, Alphabet has an edge over Apple when it comes to share price valuation.\nHere's a look at each stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which reflects what investors are paying for every dollar of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\nAlphabet's earnings multiple has been lower than Apple's throughout 2025 and continues to be so despite a rise in its P/E ratio over recent weeks. This makes it a better value over the iPhone maker.\nWith its new Gemini 3 AI model now live, Alphabet could see further strong sales growth in 2026 as it continues to expand its already promising AI capabilities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia by the End of 2026\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock is at risk in 2026 if revenue growth slows down.\nAlphabet is gaining market share back in artificial intelligence (AI) and should keep growing its earnings next year.\nAmazon has a chance to grow its operating leverage if it can stay disciplined with its cost base.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIs 2026 the year Nvidia finally underperforms versus the broad market? I think it might be.\nThe leader in artificial intelligence ( AI ) computer chips is unlikely to give up all its gains from the last few years, but it is facing increasing competition, a high starting valuation, and the potential of near-term overspending to build out AI infrastructure. That makes the stock risky for 2026.\nThat doesn't mean you should dump your entire position. However, if you are thinking of buying AI stocks in 2026, there are two companies I believe will finish the year with larger market caps than Nvidia: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Here's why both are better buys than Nvidia today.\nAlphabet's AI comeback Alphabet is the conglomerate that owns Google, YouTube, Android, Waymo, and other technology properties. It is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, with billions of users across multiple product lines.\nThe stock was deemed a potential AI loser after ChatGPT came out and rapidly began taking market share of search and AI queries, with Alphabet falling flat-footed after the launch. Now, with the launch of updated Gemini AI models for text, images, and video creation (among other things), Alphabet is steadily gaining market share back from OpenAI and ChatGPT.\n\nIts stock has begun to perform because of it. Alphabet stock is up 60% year to date (YTD), which is more than double the returns of Nvidia. It is growing revenue at 15% year over year in constant currency, and with expanding profit margins. The durability of Google Search and YouTube, fast growth at Google Cloud, and long-term plays with Gemini and Waymo's self-driving cars should help Alphabet keep compounding its earnings power for years to come.\nAmazon's dual engines Alphabet's growth path in 2026 is clear. Amazon's will be determined by management's ability to wrangle costs that spiraled out of control during the pandemic years, which is a headwind still impacting the business.\nAmazon's cloud computing division -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- grew revenue 20% year over year last quarter, with a fat 36% operating margin over the last 12 months. Cloud computing is benefiting from the AI infrastructure expansion, with Amazon specifically helped by the likes of its partner Anthropic, a start-up growing incredibly quickly that Amazon is also an investor in. OpenAI is in talks with Amazon about a $10 billion investment that would likely flow back through to AWS cloud computing spending.\n\nStory Continues\nYou have a 36% operating margin at AWS. In retail, Amazon is still growing strongly, with double-digit growth in the last few years in North America and internationally. Advertising, third-party seller services, and subscription revenue now generate $279 billion in trailing revenue, or 40% of Amazon's total revenue. These segments have high profit margins and have been growing faster than the overall Amazon retail business.\n\nAnd yet Amazon's retail operations in North America only have a 6.6% operating margin. This could be looked at as a failure or a future path to profit expansion. Amazon has been trimming its ranks through layoffs, which should help margins expand throughout 2026 and beyond. If retail can keep up this operating leverage, along with the fast growth at AWS, then Amazon's profitability will explode in 2026.\nThe math: Why Amazon and Alphabet will be worth more than Nvidia Today, Alphabet generates $128 billion in operating income, Nvidia $110 billion, and Amazon $80 billion. Nvidia's revenue is currently growing much faster than both of these businesses, but that could come to a grinding halt if the AI infrastructure buildout slows down in 2026.\nNvidia's revenue growth doesn't have to go negative in order for earnings to fall, as it is currently implementing huge price increases for its products that are generating incredibly high profit margins. Plus, its stock trades at a more expensive earnings ratio than both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nIf Nvidia's revenue growth slows down in 2026 while Alphabet and Amazon keep chugging along, then Nvidia's earnings will likely fall along with its high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That could lead both stocks to finish 2026 with market caps larger than Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Analyst upgrades viral crypto stock's price target after billion-dollar deals\n\nPooja Rajkumari\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:18 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: HUT\n\nBTC-USD\n\nGOOG\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nBitcoin mining companies are increasingly realising the benefits of pivoting to AI.\nRecently, analyst Mark Palmer from Benchmark raised the price target for Bitcoin-miner-turned-AI company Hut 8.\nThe change in price target was due to the company’s latest push into AI data center development, which represents a step-change in the quality and durability of its cash flows.\n\nRelated: Despite bitcoin price dip, mining difficulty hits an all-time high\nAI deal drives target increase According to Palmer, Hut 8’s recent agreement with Anthropic and Fluidstack stands apart from comparable AI co-location deals announced by other digital infrastructure providers. Palmer cited the structure of the transaction, the quality of the counterparties, and the embedded downside protection as key differentiators.\n\nHut 8 announced on Dec. 17 that it would partner with Anthropic and Fluidstack to accelerate the deployment of hyperscale AI infrastructure in the United States.\nThe agreement includes a financial backstop from Google, which guarantees lease payment obligations for the base term.\nUnder the agreement, Hut 8 will develop and deliver at least 245 megawatts and up to 2,295 megawatts of AI data center capacity for Anthropic, supported by high-performance compute clusters operated by Fluidstack.\nAlongside the partnership announcement, Hut 8 disclosed a 15-year, triple-net lease with Fluidstack for the initial River Bend capacity.\nThe lease carries a base value of roughly $7 billion, includes a 3% annual rent escalator, and offers three five-year renewal options that could lift the total contract value to approximately $17.7 billion.\n\nHut 8 stock jumped nearly 4% in regular trading on Dec. 16, closing at $36.85. After the announcement, it climbed more than 21% in premarket trading the following morning to $44.60.\nAt press time, Hut 8 was up 17.78%, trading at $51.96. Year-to-date data reveal the stock has climbed about 138% as of Dec. 23.\nMore News: US introduces new bill to fix tax loopholes in crypto\nAndrew Tate says he can sell house for crypto\nMajor S&P 500 company pledges $1,000 per child\nLong-term lease de-risks cash flows Benchmark highlighted the triple-net structure with Fluidstack as a key positive.\nA triple-net lease, often written as an NNN lease, is a commercial real estate agreement where the tenant, not the landlord, pays nearly all property-related expenses in addition to base rent. The expenses include property taxes, insurance, operational costs, and maintenance.\nIn the Hut 8's case, Fluidstack is responsible for carrying the burden of paying the property expenses.\n\nStory Continues\nPalmer also pointed to a payment backstop provided by Google, which he said materially reduces counterparty risk and improves the predictability of the contracted cash flows.\nHut 8 has retained full economic ownership of the asset while avoiding equity issuance or warrants.\nBenchmark estimates the initial River Bend tranche alone is worth about $7.6 billion, reflecting both contracted revenues and the scarcity of AI-ready power backed by an investment-grade counterparty.\n\nPalmer changed the price target for Hut 8 to $85 from $78. The firm reiterated a “buy” rating in a note published on Dec. 22.\nRelated: How the halving will, or won't, impact publicly-traded bitcoin miners\nBitcoin exposure remains through ABTC Despite the growing AI footprint, Hut 8 maintains significant exposure to Bitcoin through its majority ownership of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.'s American Bitcoin Corp. (NASDAQ: ABTC). Hut 8 owns roughly 80% of ABTC , effectively positioning it as a core subsidiary within a shared Bitcoin-focused ecosystem.\n\nABTC relies on Hut 8’s data centers, energy infrastructure, and operational expertise to mine Bitcoin, allowing it to scale production and accumulate BTC without building standalone facilities. Strategically, this structure enables Hut 8 to pair long-duration, contracted AI revenues with leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s upside.\nRelated: Bitcoin miners adapt to volatile markets with flexible cost strategies\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Trading News & Analysis section.

      "Content": "How Google reclaimed its position in AI race dominated by OpenAI\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST\n\nIn this video: GOOG\n\nAlphabet's Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) has made strides in the AI race, with its Gemini chatbot emerging as a substantial alternative to OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) ChatGPT.\nYahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley outlines the details.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Dan\nYeah, Josh, Google came into the year as kind of a sort of also ran in the AI race. OpenAI was clearly in the lead with their chat GPT and latest GPT models, but that all seemed to change this year with the release of Gemini 3 just recently. Uh now companies are saying that they're more interested in Gemini 3. Uh we're also seeing some growth numbers out of Gemini 3 that are really starting to give a little bit of push back against Chat GPT as the leader in that space.\n00:41 Dan\nIn fact, uh Deep Water Asset Management managing partner Jean Munster wrote that Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in calendar year 26. And, you know, this is all coming uh as Google continues to push forward with its AI models. And, you know, it's important to note that while Google is ahead now, it doesn't mean that it's going to be ahead forever. Uh OpenAI launched their own red alert, something that Google had to do when OpenAI initially launched Chat GPT back in 2022. And so they've managed to catch up and then some at this point, and we'll just have to see what that means then for OpenAI.\n01:13 Speaker A\nWhat Dan would you say is Google's secret weapon or weapons with OpenAI? You know, would it be Dan, you know, would you focus on distribution there with with search and Chrome and Android?\n01:31 Dan\nYeah, I mean there's a number of things, right? Uh at first uh glance, there's Android, as you said, you can use Gemini on an Android phone right away. You don't need to download uh an app, you don't need to go to a website. That's kind of a a friction point for people versus Chat PT, which requires you to download an app uh or go to the web unless you're using something uh like Apple Intelligence, which has Chat GPT built in, but it's not necessarily something you can use regularly on the fly.\n02:04 Dan\nUh they also have the ability to make money, right? They're bringing in cash flow positive because they have their advertising business. They have their Google cloud platform business. They uh have YouTube and so they have all of these different points where they can pull revenue from and then put that money to work, whereas OpenAI has more than a trillion dollars of uh commitments for spending over the next few years, but they're not cash flow positive at this point. Sure, they have revenue, but it's not overcoming the amount that they have to spend.\n02:40 Dan\nUh and so you could see that that kind of back and forth between, you know, okay, uh OpenAI obviously an innovative company, Google a long-standing uh tech juggernat, invented the technology behind uh these transformer models, uh and now standing on top. Um, you know, it it's beyond their AI as well. They also uh won kind of uh a ruling in their one of their anti-trust cases where they uh weren't forced to give up Chrome and they could still enter into uh deals where they allow companies like Apple uh to distribute Google's uh search on their devices. And so, you know, they were winning on legal fronts, uh you know, to a degree, Waymo is also a big win as well. They're now doing freeway driving and things of that nature, expanding to more cities.\n03:40 Dan\nuh and then again, just on AI, they continue to seem to dominate uh at this point. But as I said, that doesn't mean it's going to be that way in 2026. OpenAI is going to be working on better models and Anthropic is also working on better models. So it's going to be this continuous back and forth, but for now, it appears that Google's in the lead.\n04:06 Speaker A\nDan, thank you.

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Deliver Market-Beating Gains Through 2030\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet has created a huge flywheel advantage that should just grow over time.\nIts edge comes from having its own world class custom AI chips and models under the same roof.\nThis advantage should only increase over time, helping the stock produce market-beating returns for years to come.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nOne of the best-positioned artificial intelligence (AI) stocks for several years is undoubtedly Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . The stock has had a strong year, but its momentum could just be beginning.\nLet's look at why the stock could deliver market-beating returns through 2030.\nAlphabet's flywheel advantage Heading into this year, Alphabet was pegged by the investment community as a probable AI loser. For the first time in a long time, its core Google search business was facing a big potential competitive threat with AI. Investors believed that chatbots, like those from OpenAI and Anthropic, could displace search, while AI-powered search from the likes of Perplexity added further competition.\n\nHowever, Alphabet was able to flip the script in 2025. It was able to raise the level of its Gemini large language model (LLM) to become one of the best AI models available. Meanwhile, it also integrated Gemini throughout its products, including Google search. It started with AI-powered features like AI Overviews and new multimodal ways to search, such as Circle to Search and Lens, that went beyond typing in search keywords. Then it introduced an entire AI Mode built right into Google search where users could easily toggle between traditional search and AI chatbot answers.\nThis ultimately creates a more frictionless experience that doesn't ask people to change what they are accustomed to doing. That's a powerful advantage that is only amplified by the distribution edge that Alphabet holds. Google search is already the default search engine on almost every device on the planet, outside of China, where it does not operate. The company owns both the world's most popular smartphone operating system and web browser, each of which has a more than 70% market share. Meanwhile, it has a search revenue-sharing deal with Apple to be the default search engine on its devices, covering much of the rest of the population that doesn't use Chrome or Android.\nInstead of seeing its search revenue shrink from increased competition, it has instead started to accelerate. As the company taps into its vast ad network and begins to find ways to monetize AI even more, this growth should only continue to accelerate.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Alphabet's biggest weapon is its custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). The company developed these custom chips more than a decade ago, and they help run most of Alphabet's internal workloads. As an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), they are preprogrammed to specifically handle tasks optimized for Google's TensorFlow framework and more recently, other frameworks, such as JAX and PyTorch. (That last part is actually important, as it opens the door for it to sell TPUs directly to companies like Anthropic, which uses PyTorch.) Notably, though, it's more than just the hardware, as Alphabet has also designed and integrated its software (like its XLA compilers) around these chips.\n\nAs such, they can outperform general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) at these specific tasks, while also being more energy efficient. This gives Alphabet a huge structural cost advantage against competitors that rely almost solely on Nvidia 's expensive GPUs. Not only are its chips cheaper, but they are also more cost effective to use, which will only become more important as more people use AI and total inference costs rise.\nHaving both less expensive training and inference costs creates a virtuous cycle for Alphabet. It's getting more bang for its buck with its spending on training, which makes its models better, which gets more people to adopt Gemini, which lets it funnel more money to make its AI models better, and so on. Meanwhile, it also gives its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, a big edge, as it can also offer customers more cost-effective options than training and running inference on Nvidia-based servers. This should allow it to capture higher gross margins and have a higher return on investment (ROI) on its capital expenditures (capex) spending than competitors.\n\nWhy the stock will outperform Alphabet is just starting to see the rewards of the flywheel effect it has created, and the benefits should just widen over time. Amazon and Microsoft have developed their own custom chips, but they are not yet at the level of TPUs, and it will take many years to catch up to have the same level of software-to-hardware integration. Meanwhile, OpenAI's custom chip efforts are still in the development stage, and it doesn't have the same level of distribution or ad network as Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet is the only company with both world class AI chips and models, which sets it up to be one of the biggest AI winners and for its stock to have market-beating returns in the years ahead.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

Uh, you emphasize strong seasonal trends, Eric, you point out solid earnings growth, you talk about, you do raise some some questions on your radar as well. What what would those be Eric as we head into 2026?\n00:17 Eric\nWell, first off, uh always a pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me, Josh.\n00:22 Eric\nUh there's a lot of great momentum.\n00:27 Eric\nI think um the questions are simply one, valuation, right? And we and we know that.\n00:36 Eric\nUm concentration, right? We know that the top 10 stocks in the S&P now account for 40% of the value of the S&P. That is\n00:47 Eric\nas concentrated uh as we've ever been.\n00:52 Eric\nAnd we actually know from history, if you go back to 1970, once we get over 30% in those top 10, going out the next five years, there's a 95% chance\n01:06 Eric\nthat the other 490 are going to outperform those top 10.\n01:12 Eric\nUm so I'm concerned about concentration. And then of course with AI, look, AI is real. This is a game changer. It's going to change the world.\n01:20 Eric\nBut a lot of this is definitely focused on Open AI. Open AI is is right out there saying, hey guys, we're going to be losing money for a long time. We might be profitable\n01:30 Eric\n2030.\n01:32 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient and wait while all this capX happens and money's being invested and we're not seeing that ROI yet.\n01:43 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient with that? You know, I'm not sure. I think there's going to be a lot of volatility.\n01:49 Speaker A\nIn terms of that AI trade, Eric, looking ahead in 2026, do you think about, listen, I'll I'll just, I'll stick with the Mag 7 as a basket or do you feel like no, I'm going to have to be more discerning next year. It's going to get tougher. Maybe it's the mag 3 or four.\n02:04 Eric\nUh it's a great question. I mean, look, we're not stock pickers at the Wealth Alliance, we're more asset allocators.\n02:10 Eric\nI think if you own the Mag 7, I think you're going to be okay. Let's not forget, the Mag 7 the last decade has grown its earnings 20-fold.\n02:19 Eric\nThat is a 35% compounded versus about 8% for the S&P.\n02:25 Eric\nI think it's okay to have Mag 7 exposure and you should. My concern is when I see a lot of new clients are coming into the firm, they're just loaded up in tech.\n02:34 Eric\nAnd they're not diversified. And I'm I just hit my 40th anniversary doing this. and I remember 1999 and 2000, seeing the same thing. People just loaded up in the same stocks. That was just gets me all nervous. Stay diversified. Look at this year, international emerging markets handily beating the US.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Securing access to energy that powers data centers has become a critical part of training AI models.\n\nAlphabet previously held a minority stake in Intersect Power after Google and TPG Rise Climate led an $800 million strategic funding round in the company last December. That partnership set a target of $20 billion in total investment by 2030.\nThe acquisition includes Intersect’s future development projects but excludes its existing operation, which will be bought out by other investors and managed as a separate company.\nIntersect’s new data parks, which are essentially locations next to wind, solar, and battery power, are expected to be operational late next year and fully completed by 2027, Google said when it announced its minority investment.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year.\nGoogle will be the primary user. However, Intersect’s campuses are designed as industrial parks that can host other companies’ AI chips alongside Google’s.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump Enters the Race for Fusion Power\n\nAlex Kimani\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:00 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nSSUMF\n\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NYSE:DJT) have surged nearly 70% after the company agreed to merge with fusion startup TAE Technologies in a $6 billion deal. Under the terms of the deal, shareholders of each company will own roughly half of the combined entity on a fully diluted equity basis. Trump Media, majority owned by U.S. President Donald Trump, will now become the holding company for TAE Power Solutions and TAE Life Sciences alongside current holdings Truth Social, Truth+ and Truth.Fi.\n\nFounded in 1998, TAE Technologies aims to deploy commercial, utility-scale fusion energy. The company plans to commence construction of its first fusion power plant in 2026, expected to generate 350-500 MWe.\nTAE Technologies has raised more than $1.3 billion thanks to backing by high-profile investors, including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and Sumitomo Corporation of America. The company plans to employ neutral particle beams and magnets in its fusion reactors instead of standard lasers.\nWidely regarded as the Holy Grail of low-carbon electricity, nuclear fusion works by &lsquo;smashing&rsquo; together hydrogen atoms to create helium and release energy through the famous E=MC2 mass-energy equivalence. Fusion is the process by which stars, including our own sun, generate vast amounts of energy in their cores.\n\nNuclear fusion is able to generate four times as much energy as nuclear fission from the same mass of fuel. Fusion reactors are highly regarded not only because of their massive power output but also because they produce much less radioactive waste and cannot melt down, unlike fission reactors, where uncontrolled chain reactions can be catastrophic.\nNuclear fission is a process where a nucleus (usually of a heavy atom like uranium) splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy and additional neutrons. These released neutrons can then induce further fission events, leading to a chain reaction.\nAfter a long period of stagnation, nuclear fusion is hot again thanks to the ongoing global nuclear renaissance amid surging energy demand. Back in August, Sam Altman-backed Helion Energy began construction of its first commercial nuclear fusion plant in Chelan County, Washington. Helion&rsquo;s project has already undergone rigorous environmental assessments as part of the Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) process by the State of Washington.\n\nTwo years ago, Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Helion Energy to buy electricity from the nuclear fusion startup beginning in 2028. Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) was appointed as the marketer for the zero-carbon electricity Helion plans to generate at its Orion plant.\n\nStory Continues\nHelion has scored some important fusion milestones, with its Trenta prototype the first private reactor to achieve nuclear fusion on a commercial scale. Trenta--Helion&rsquo;s sixth fusion prototype--has been able to achieve a critical fuel temperature of 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, widely considered a benchmark for commercial fusion viability.\n\nTesting of the prototype began in 2019 and concluded in January 2023, during which the facility completed nearly 10,000 high-power pulses and operated under vacuum for 16 months. Trenta uses a pulsed magneto-inertial fusion (MIF) approach to generate fusion energy. It accelerates two Field Reversed Configurations (FRCs) of plasma to collide, compressing them to fusion temperatures and directly recapturing the released energy as electricity, bypassing the traditional steam turbine cycle.\nChina Enters Fusion Race\nThat said, China has entered the fusion race with a bang. Whereas the U.S. was among the world&rsquo;s first countries to bet big on this futuristic gambit, China&rsquo;s foray came much later. China has been making rapid progress over the past decade, and now owns more fusion patents than any country according to industry data published by Nikkei. Further, China is building projects at record speed.\n\nChina's private fusion energy company, Energy Singularity , has achieved several significant breakthroughs in developing high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tokamak devices aimed at accelerating the commercialization of fusion energy. In June 2024, the company's HH70 device successfully achieved its \"first plasma,\" making it the first and only operational full high-temperature superconducting tokamak built by a commercial company globally. The HH70 device was designed and constructed in under two years, a world record for the fastest development and construction of a superconducting tokamak.\nIn early 2025, Energy Singularity's large-bore D-shaped HTS magnet, named \"Jingtian\" generated a world-record magnetic field of 21.7 tesla in a test. This surpassed the previous record held by a U.S. company/MIT collaboration and is a critical step for developing smaller, more cost-effective fusion reactors.The company is now developing its next-generation device, the HH170, which is planned for completion by 2027 and aims to achieve a tenfold energy gain (Q>10), a crucial milestone for commercial viability.\n\nInterestingly, just like it did with AI models, China is pulling off impressive fusion milestones with much less. To wit, Energy Singularity has so far received just $112 million in private investment, significantly less than U.S. fusion startups. For some context, Charles Seife, director of the Arthur L. Carter Institute of Journalism at New York University, estimates that France-based International Thermonuclear Experimental Reacto r (ITER) project costs have surpassed &euro;20 billion ($21.8 billion), more than four times the original budget of &euro;5 billion (then $5.5 billion) and nearly a decade late from its 2016 delivery date.\nThat said, Energy Singularity is not the only fusion startup that&rsquo;s pursuing small reactor designs. Deven, Massachusetts-based Commonwealth Fusion Systems is collaborating with MIT to build its small fusion reactor.\n\nThe company has achieved major breakthroughs in fusion energy by developing world-record High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnets, enabling smaller, more powerful tokamaks like their SPARC device, which aims to be the first to produce net energy. They've secured massive funding (around $3 billion), validated their magnet technology with the U.S. DOE, and demonstrated key magnet performance milestones. CFS is now building its SPARC reactor to prove net-energy fusion, paving the way for its first commercial power plant, ARC.\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nAdani Explores Nuclear Power Foray With 16 GW Small Reactor Project\nPutin Lashes Out as EU Agrees to Loan $105 Billion to Ukraine\nIraqi Crude Can&rsquo;t Replace Venezuelan Oil in the U.S. Market\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

Alphabet's (GOOGL) self-driving unit, Waymo, saw several vehicles stall during San Francisco's power outage, causing traffic disruptions but luckily no injuries. Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed the incident on X, posting video footage and stating that \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"\n\nLooking back, Tesla stock has tended to outperform in December , historically, finishing the month higher in seven of the past 10 years. Additional record highs may be in the cards, as today's peak comes amid low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for TSLA in the past.\nAccording to data from Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been two instances in the past five years when Tesla stock traded within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer’s Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th percentile, or lower, of its annual range -- as is the case with the security’s current SVI of 46%, which sits low in the 6th percentile of its annual range.\nIn both prior cases, Tesla stock was higher a month later after both of these signals, averaging a large 17% return. From its current perch, a move of similar magnitude would put the equity at $577.78.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Taboola (TBLA) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why\n\nAdam Hejl\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 12:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TBLA\n\nGOOG\n\nWhat Happened? Shares of content discovery platform Taboola (NASDAQ:TBLA) jumped 2.8% in the afternoon session after analyst firm Rosenblatt initiated coverage on the stock with a 'Buy' rating and a $6 price target.\nThe price target suggested a potential upside of nearly 50% from its previous closing price. According to the research firm, Taboola's shares had been \"mis-characterized as a secular loser from Google AI-search,\" which resulted in the stock's relatively flat performance over the previous year. This new bullish coverage indicated that investor concerns about competition from AI-driven search innovations may have been overstated, providing a more optimistic outlook for the company's future.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $4.17, up 3% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Taboola? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Taboola’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 3.3% on the news that a technical sell signal indicated the potential for further declines.\n\nThe downward move appeared to be driven by technical factors. A sell signal was reportedly issued from a recent peak, and the stock had fallen more than 3% since that point, suggesting further declines were possible. This technical pressure was compounded by negative insider sentiment. Over the previous year, key executives had sold a significant amount of shares on the open market, totaling $44.1 million against $16.1 million in shares bought or received.\nTaboola is up 11.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.17 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $4.18 from December 2025.

      "Content": "Why Are First Solar (FSLR) Shares Soaring Today\n\nAdam Hejl\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 12:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: FSLR\n\nGOOG\n\nWhat Happened? Shares of solar panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) jumped 6% in the afternoon session after Alphabet announced it would acquire Intersect Power, a major customer that purchases First Solar's solar panels.\nAlphabet entered into an agreement to purchase the data center and energy infrastructure company for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of debt. Intersect Power was a major buyer of First Solar's thin-film solar panels, with significant multi-gigawatt orders placed in previous years. The deal likely boosted investor confidence as it secured a key customer relationship.\n\nThis news also followed other positive developments, including the recent inauguration of a $1.1 billion manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which was expected to significantly boost the company's solar panel production capacity.\nIs now the time to buy First Solar? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us First Solar’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 34 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock dropped 20.3% on the news that a U.S. Senate panel proposed phasing out solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028, raising concerns about future profitability and project viability for solar companies. The phasing out is expected to begin as early as 2026, diminishing the financial incentives that have been critical drivers of growth in the renewable energy sector.\nFirst Solar is up 53% since the beginning of the year, and at $285.28 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of First Solar’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,713.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

      "Content": "Alphabet Buying Clean Energy Developer to Support Data Centers\n\nContributed Content\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 11:36 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAlphabet, the parent of technology giant Google, has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Intersect, which provides data center and energy infrastructure solutions, for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of debt. Google already owns a minority stake in Intersect from a previously announced funding round. The acquisition announced December 22 will enable more data center and generation capacity to come online, faster, while accelerating energy development and innovation, Alphabet said in a news release. Included in the transaction are Intersect’s team and multiple gigawatts of energy and data center projects in development, or under construction, from its successful existing partnership with Google. Intersect will also explore a range of emerging technologies to increase and diversify energy supply, while supporting Google’s U.S. data center investments to meet its Cloud customers’ and users’ demand. Intersect’s operations will remain separate from Alphabet and Google under the Intersect brand and will be led by Sheldon Kimber. It will partner closely with Google’s technical infrastructure team, continuing work on in-development, and new, joint projects; this includes the companies’ first announced co-located data center and power site, under construction in Haskell County, Texas. Intersect’s existing operating assets in Texas, and its operating and in-development assets in California, will not be part of the acquisition. Those assets continue to operate as an independent company, supported by existing investors TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, and Greenbelt Capital Partners. Intersect expects a seamless transition and service continuity for customers of those assets. “Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership. We look forward to welcoming Sheldon and the Intersect team,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. “Intersect has always been focused on bringing innovation to the industry and we look forward to accelerating at scale as part of Google,” said Sheldon Kimber, founder and CEO, Intersect. “Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI. We share Google’s conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.”\n\nAdvancing U.S. Energy Innovation and Capacity The acquisition will augment Alphabet and Google’s ongoing commitment to partnering with utilities and energy developers across the sector to unlock abundant, reliable, affordable energy supply that enables the buildout of data center infrastructure without passing on costs to grid customers. Alphabet is committed to creating new pathways and partnerships to responsibly increase energy supply, while advancing the rapid commercialization of advanced energy technologies—including advanced geothermal, long duration energy storage, and natural gas with carbon capture and storage. Additionally, Alphabet is deploying artificial intelligence to accelerate the grid connection of new power plants and helping scale energy efficiency and affordability programs in data center communities. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions and anticipated to close in the first half of 2026. —This content was contributed by Alphabet .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Waymo is back online in San Francisco, but may struggle after failure\n\nTony Owusu\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:17 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Waymo, 2025 has been a year of one step forward and two steps back.\nFor now, it has leapt ahead of big money rivals like Tesla Robotaxi and Amazon-backed Zoox.\nWaymo quick facts: Founded in 2009.\nPassed the first U.S. state self-driving test in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2012.\nSource: IEEE Spectrum\nSpun out from Alphabet as a separate subsidiary in 2016.\nAs of July 2025, Google indicates that Waymo One is available 24/7 to customers in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nThe current Waymo fleet features over 1,500 vehicles. By 2026, the company expects to add 2,000 more.\n\nWaymo began operating fully autonomous vehicles in Miami on Nov. 18 and said it will start operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando “over the coming weeks, ahead of opening our doors to riders next year.”\nIt is also “returning” to Las Vegas and regularly testing in Detroit during winter weather , and spreading its fleet of more than 200 vehicles to new locations seemingly every month.\nBut the Alphabet-backed company is also facing issues such as a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probe into the autonomous vehicles for “traffic safety violations relating to stopping when encountering a school bus, particularly when the bus is boarding or offboarding students.”\nBut recently, some of Waymo's biggest issues have arisen in the company's home city of San Francisco.\nSan Francisco power outage temporarily stops Waymo autonomous vehicles Waymo currently operates a fleet of approximately 2,000 vehicles on U.S. roads.\nApproximately 800 of those autonomous vehicles are operating in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to data the company shared with the San Francisco Examiner in August , making the City by the Bay the company's unofficial center of operations.\n\nRelated: Waymo customer swears off autonomous driving after close call\nHowever, the company recently experienced a significant issue in its hometown.\nIn a viral video from No Safe Words on X ( formerly Twitter ), it looked like an endless line of Waymos had taken over one city street on Nov. 22. The company says the vehicles were all headed to a “mass hailing event” in the video, causing the bottleneck that was filmed.\nThis weekend, the company experienced an even more disruptive event after its San Francisco fleet was unable to navigate the terrain during a massive blackout in the city, which has a population of more than 800,000.\nWaymo was forced to suspend service in San Francisco, as apparently its vehicles did not know the \"four-way-stop\" rule that applies to intersections with inoperable traffic lights.\n\nStory Continues\nThe vehicles were filmed stuck at numerous intersections , unsure how to navigate the situation , causing even more turmoil on the roads as drivers slowly inch past electricity-less city blocks.\nA fire caused the outage, which affected 130,000 citizens in the city.\n“The sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion,” Waymo said in a statement as it temporarily shut down operations in the city.\n\nWaymo restores San Francisco service, but can it restore customer faith in the company? While Waymo suspended the service on Saturday, Dec. 20, by 7 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Waymo said it was resuming service in the region.\nAs for the passengers caught in the vehicles during the disruption, Waymo says \"the majority of active trips were completed before vehicles returned to depots or pulled over,\" so at least \"the majority\" of passengers weren't left stranded.\n\nRelated: Waymo pulls ahead of Tesla Robotaxi, Amazon Zoox with latest move\nWaymo says its vehicles represent a 91% reduction in serious injury or worse crashes, a 79% decrease in airbag deployment crashes, and an 80% decrease in injury-causing crashes.\nWaymo is also safer for non-drivers, with 92% fewer pedestrian crashes resulting in injuries, 78% fewer cyclist crashes resulting in injuries, and 89% fewer motorcycle crashes resulting in injuries.\nBut good luck to Waymo convincing San Franciscans, and other Californians, about those numbers after the recent high-profile incidents in the city.\nNearly 80% of California voters support requiring a human safety operator in self-driving trucks and delivery vehicles, and just 33% of voters express a favorable general impression of autonomous vehicles.\n\n“We are increasingly bringing AI from the digital world to the physical world, and it’s critically important that we do that in a very careful and considerate way,” Rowan Stone, CEO of AI data training company Sapien, told TheStreet.\nSapien currently works with Waymo rival Zoox.\n“What we can do better as an entire industry is resist the urge to move quickly and break things, especially when you’re dealing with a hunk of metal that could potentially kill people,” he said.\nWaymo issues extend beyond San Francisco San Francisco isn't the only city where Waymo has had to temporarily pause operations in recent weeks.\nOn Dec. 1, after Waymo received its 20th citation from the Austin Independent School District for the current school year, Austin ISD decided to release the video of the previous infractions to the public.\n\nBy Dec. 5, Waymo announced that it would file for a voluntary recall after videos of the company's robotaxis committing traffic violations while operating in school bus zones went viral.\nThe Austin ISD had been in private contact with the company, but as the incidences of Waymos driving through school bus stop signs piled up (eventually averaging 1.5 per week), the Austin ISD decided to go public.\n“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” said Muaricio Peña, chief security officer for Waymo.\nBack in California, Waymos have been recorded piling up at Santa Monica charging stations at night in Southern California.\n\nA video , posted on X by Nic Cruz Patane, shows a seemingly endless line of lifeless robots waiting to be charged, is eerily similar to the video from San Francisco.\nOn Nov. 24, the city formally demanded Waymo cease overnight operations at its two local autonomous vehicle charging facilities.\nThe move comes after months of noise complaints from nearby residents, according to the Santa Monica Daily Press . The directive was unanimously approved in a 6-0 City Council vote on Nov. 18, but now the city is demanding that property owners, lessees, and operators immediately stop nighttime operations due to nuisance conditions at the two charging sites.\nResidents in the neighborhood have complained about the constant noise and disruption caused by the 24-hour operations, with some deliberately blocking the vehicles’ entry and exit. They have been bothered by everything from the legally mandated backup alarms to other vehicle noises that have become incessant.\n\nIn a statement, Waymo said it has been listening to community input and is “committed to continuing to operate and invest” in Santa Monica. It says it has adjusted operations at the site in response to community feedback and that it will continue to seek community input.\nRelated: Waymo pumps the brakes as dangerous issue comes to light\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

(AP) — Google's corporate parent on Monday announced an agreement to buy data center energy specialist Intersect for $4.75 billion as part of its effort to secure the vast amounts of electricity needed to power artificial intelligence technology.\nAlphabet, which depends on Google's search engine and other online services for most of its revenue, is buying out Intersect in its entirety after purchasing a stake in the San Francisco-based startup a year ago. Intersect had previously raised $2.1 billion from Google and other early investors.\n\nAfter the acquisition is completed during the first half of next year, Alphabet intends to allow Intersect to operate independently while continuing its efforts to secure the energy sources needed for the sprawling data centers being built to power the AI services rolling out from Google and rivals such as OpenAI .\nThe power-hungry data centers, which are being likened to AI factories, is fueling a backlash in communities where residents have been interpreting their steadily rising electricity bills as evidence that they help helping footing the boom for a technology boom that could still go bust.\nIntersect focuses on finding ways to increase and diversify the supply of energy in an effort to keep hold down power costs. It's already working on a data center for Mountain View, California-based Alphabet in Haskell County, Texas.\nGoogle's inroads with AI has helped increase Alphabet's stock price by more than 60% so far this year, generating an additional $1.4 trillion in shareholder wealth.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Alphabet to acquire Intersect for $4.75 billion to boost data center capacity\n\nVlad Schepkov\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Google’s parent Alphabet announced Monday it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Intersect, a provider of data center and energy infrastructure solutions, for $4.75 billion in cash plus the assumption of debt.\nGoogle already owns a minority stake in Intersect from a previous funding round. The acquisition aims to enable more data center and generation capacity to come online faster while accelerating energy development and innovation.\n\nThe deal includes Intersect’s team and multiple gigawatts of energy and data center projects currently in development or under construction from its existing partnership with Google. Intersect will explore emerging technologies to increase energy supply while supporting Google’s U.S. data center investments to meet Cloud customer demand.\nUnder the agreement, Intersect’s operations will remain separate from Alphabet and Google, continuing under the Intersect brand with Sheldon Kimber as leader. The company will work closely with Google’s technical infrastructure team on ongoing and new joint projects, including their first co-located data center and power site being built in Haskell County, Texas.\nIntersect’s existing operating assets in Texas and its operating and in-development assets in California will not be included in the acquisition. These assets will continue to operate as an independent company, backed by investors TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, and Greenbelt Capital Partners.\n\n\"Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.\nSheldon Kimber, founder and CEO of Intersect, stated: \"Intersect has always been focused on bringing innovation to the industry and we look forward to accelerating at scale as part of Google. Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI. We share Google’s conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.\"\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2026.\nRelated articles\nAlphabet to acquire Intersect for $4.75 billion to boost data center capacity\nLoading Up HEAVY on These 3 Stocks by End of 2025 (+ 1 New ETF)\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "How Caterpillar Crushed the Magnificent 7 in 2025 — And It’s Not Done Yet!\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nQuick Read Caterpillar ( CAT ) rose 61% in 2025 to become the top Dow performer. Caterpillar outpaced six of the seven Magnificent 7 tech stocks.\nCaterpillar’s Energy and Transportation segment drove gains with Q3 power generation sales up 31% from AI data center demand.\nCaterpillar raised guidance to 5% to 7% annual sales growth through 2030 with adjusted operating margins reaching 21% to 25% at $100B sales.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate market headlines in 2025, many of the stocks most closely tied to the technology -- the Magnificent 7 stocks of Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) -- have shown volatility or lagged.\nSix of the seven have experienced mixed or negative returns at points throughout the year, with broad concerns over valuations, sector rotations, and sustainability weighing on performance. In contrast, one unexpected name has outperformed six of the seven: Caterpillar ( NYSE:CAT ), the heavy equipment manufacturer. On a total return basis (capital appreciation plus dividends), Caterpillar trails only Alphabet by about one percentage point or so as of last Friday's close. Yet less than two weeks ago, Caterpillar was even ahead of Alphabet in year-to-date gains.\n\nSo, how is a traditional industrial company easily outpacing some of the world's largest tech giants?\nCaterpillar's Strong 2025 Performance Caterpillar has risen approximately 61% in 2025 compared to Alphabet's roughly 62 % gain, leaving the heavy equipment manufacturer just behind the tech behemoth and with the potential to surpass it by year-end.\nIt also stands as the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , edging out Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) in second place, and significantly outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7, with only Nvidia, which has returned almost 35% this year, coming close.\n\nWhat Is Doing the Heavy Lifting for Caterpillar Caterpillar's outperformance stems from strong demand in its Energy and Transportation segment, particularly generators and power equipment for AI data centers and infrastructure. Partnerships like the one with Vertiv ( NYSE:VRT ) for data center power solutions have highlighted Caterpillar's role in supporting AI growth.\nEnduring global infrastructure spending and mining demand have also contributed, but the real standout has been in power generation and oil and gas, segments that saw sales rise 31% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nTariffs posed challenges earlier in the year, with estimated costs up to $1.8 billion in 2025, but the company mitigated impacts through cost controls and pricing adjustments. Still, inflation continues to weigh on margins, with consolidated operating profits slipping 3%.\nHowever, these drivers that carried Caterpillar higher in 2025 appear sustainable into 2026, with analysts pointing to ongoing AI-related power needs and potential infrastructure rebounds. The risks of tariff escalation and cyclical slowdowns in construction or mining remain present.\n\nKey Takeaway Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar often deliver the best returns when bought during downturns to capture upside as cycles recover. Caterpillar began rising in late 2022, gained strongly in 2023, and delivered about 24% returns in 2024. In 2025, shares faltered on tariff fears in April before doubling from those lows.\n\nAt this point in the cycle, Caterpillar remains a solid holding, with tailwinds from AI infrastructure and global demand likely continuing into next year and beyond. Their strength allowed management to raise guidance for the next five years.\nCaterpillar is now expecting 5% to 7% compound annual sales growth through 2030, adjusted operating margins of 15% to 19% at $60 billion in sales and 21% to 25% at $100 billion in sales, and $6 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow—a 20% to 50% increase over prior estimates. While valuations are elevated with the stock trading well above its five-year average across most metrics, the structural shift toward power generation supports further gains rather than an imminent peak.\nAI's strong tailwinds will likely carry Caterpillar stock beyond the typical cyclical decline, and though investors should monitor economic indicators and keep an eye on whether AI is truly in a bubble phase or not, taking profits now may be premature given the outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

The outage, which stemmed from a fire at a PG&E ( NYSE:PCG ) substation, knocked out traffic lights at major intersections and at one point affected roughly 130,000 customers during a peak holiday shopping weekend. As stores closed and transit services were interrupted, Waymo vehicles operated by Alphabet Inc. were among the services impacted, with videos circulating online showing cars halted in the roadway with hazard lights flashing.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with PCG.\nIs PCG fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nOne rider, Michele Riva, described how his Waymo car continued driving through less crowded streets before stopping abruptly near a dense intersection with non-functioning traffic signals, leaving him without advance notice. As pedestrians crossed freely in the absence of traffic lights, Riva believed the vehicle may have defaulted to a conservative safety posture, possibly struggling to interpret the situation. After waiting several minutes for customer support amid heavy call volumes, he exited the vehicle and walked the remaining distance, later noting that while the experience was unpleasant, the decision to stop may have been driven by safety considerations.\n\nBy Sunday morning, PG&E Corp. said power had been restored to about 110,000 customers, with roughly 21,000 still without electricity, while Waymo paused service across at least seven Bay Area cities as teams coordinated with local officials to resume operations. The episode also drew attention from competitors, after Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk posted on X that his companies' robotaxi services were unaffected by the outage. For investors tracking the autonomous-vehicle race, the incident may highlight how edge-case infrastructure failures could influence operational resilience, regulatory discussions, and relative positioning among emerging robotaxi platforms.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

People familiar with the figures told the publication that OpenAI's internal compute margin, which measures revenue left after model-running costs for paying users, reached 70% as of October, up from 52% at the end of 2024 and roughly double the level seen in January 2024. An OpenAI spokesperson said the company does not disclose these figures and declined further comment, but the improvement could suggest that recent monetization efforts across corporate and consumer offerings are beginning to gain traction, even as the company remains unprofitable.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with PCG.\nIs GOOG fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAt the same time, OpenAI continues to face pressure around spending discipline and intensifying competition. After Alphabet Inc.'s Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) Gemini model performed better on certain benchmarks, Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman reportedly called a code red, redirecting internal resources toward improving ChatGPT and slowing progress on an advertising initiative. Most users still rely on ChatGPT's free tier, but OpenAI has been pushing its business-focused products and paid software features for industries such as financial services and education, where it competes directly with Google and privately held rival Anthropic.\n\nThe Information also reported that OpenAI's paid accounts generate better compute margins than Anthropic's, while Anthropic is said to operate with stronger overall server efficiency. Against that backdrop, OpenAI is in early discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and potentially use its chips, a move that could value the company at north of $500 billion. These talks, alongside the reported margin gains, suggest OpenAI is attempting to balance revenue optimization with the heavy infrastructure demands required to remain competitive at the frontier of AI development.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\nIn 2025, OpenAI has battled the perception that it was ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek , all while the company has tried to shore up its relationship with Washington , pursued ambitious data center projects, and laid the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Most recently though, headlines around OpenAI have focused on its competition gaining ground, with CEO Sam Altman’s “code red” internal memo shifting company focus toward its flagship chatbot.\n\nAnd going further into the archives for context, this year came after a packed 2024, from OpenAI’s partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.\nBelow, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year.

You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”\n\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs : a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1 OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X , that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing . He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product . The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API , which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’ OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information . One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nChatGPT can directly edit your code The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools , including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025 . ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.\n\nFebruary 2025 OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X , Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’ OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nJanuary 2025 OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”\nChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders . For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’ OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nFAQs: What is ChatGPT?

So I just think it's a lack of sellers. I I'm not nearly as bullish as as you are going into January, but for now, I just think it's a lack of sellers.\n00:32 Brian\nUh why not? What gives you pause, Tom?\n00:37 Tom\nUh just price. I mean, if you're, you know, I'm I'm a pretty, I've been a pretty active trader for a long time and price is kind of everything. I don't really think about anything, you know, beyond price. and sometimes you get to the point where you're like, hey, it it just becomes a pot odds play, Brian. Where is there more risk? Is there more risk to staying long or is there a better payout being short? That's all it is.\n01:04 Brian\nIs there underneath the surface of let's say Nvidia, Tom and some of those well-known uh AI plays? Are there other areas of the market in in AI that are that are breaking down that that are red flags to you?\n01:15 Tom\nNo, not yet. I mean, I mean the the small caps, the small cap AI stocks are trailing a little bit, but not really and there's a lot of stocks in the pipeline that, you know, also look good that might come out as IPOs in 2026. But for the most part, I think it's just, it's just the mega tech, the mega tech stocks. It's it's the it's the big, too big to fail companies. And I think in that sense, that's where the real risk is.\n01:33 Brian\nBrooke, I mentioned here at the top that uh AI is back in rally mode. I call out Nvidia, Microsoft, but if if you dig down a little deeper, it's not every one of these stocks have been rocking the past five or even 10 trading sessions.\n01:46 Brooke\nYeah, if you take a look, there are some companies that are definitely pulling back some momentum. For example, we do have Oracle moving higher today, up about 1.2%, but if you take a look over the month, it's down about 2%. Over the past six months, down about 5% as we make our way into year end. And also, in addition to that, to take a look at some of the players that did go public this year. Take for example, we have uh another one like Core Weave moving higher today up about 3.5%. On the flip side, that stock up nearly 20% year uh or rather in the past month alone as we make our way into the end of the year. I think that investors are really trying to see how exactly they could still get into this this tech rally, still find those spots that maybe have been underperformers as of late in fear that they might miss out. I think we're seeing a bit of FOMO as we make our way into the later days and the last few days of this year's trading session.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The findings come from the 2025 RankOS™ AI Visibility Benchmark , a national analysis conducted using RankOS™, the company’s proprietary operating system for brand visibility across AI-powered and traditional search platforms.\n\nDeveloped and refined over several years through active client deployment across more than 500 brands spanning D2C ecommerce, retail, B2B and SaaS, RankOS™ was built to measure how brands are represented, cited, and evaluated by AI systems as search behavior shifts from results pages to direct answers.\n____\nKey Findings from the 2025 RankOS™ AI Visibility Benchmark\nThe benchmark analyzed thousands of branded, non-branded, and category-level queries across multiple AI-powered search platforms and traditional search environments. Key findings include:\n87% of businesses do not appear in AI-generated search answers\nDespite strong traditional SEO performance, the vast majority of brands lack the authority and citation signals required for AI inclusion.\nOnly 13% of businesses were cited by AI systems at least once\nAI engines showed a strong preference for a small subset of highly verifiable brands.\nBrands with third-party media citations were 4× more likely to be referenced by AI\nAI systems disproportionately favored brands supported by authoritative external sources.\nLess than 20% of mid-market companies had complete, AI-readable structured data\nMissing or inconsistent schema was one of the most common barriers to AI visibility.\nEntity ambiguity remains a leading exclusion factor\nAI systems frequently failed to distinguish between similarly named brands without clear entity validation.\nAI visibility correlates with downstream business impact\nBrands appearing in AI answers showed higher branded search volume, increased inbound inquiries, and stronger trust signals.\n\nStory Continues\n____\nWhy AI Visibility Differs from Traditional SEO\nTraditional SEO is primarily optimized for ranking web pages. AI-powered search systems, by contrast, evaluate brands as entities , relying on signals such as:\nConsistent entity representation across the web\nVerified third-party citations and references\nStructured data that clearly defines brand identity\nTrust signals derived from authoritative sources\n\nRankOS™ was designed to measure these factors continuously and translate them into actionable insights.\n____\nThe Role of RankOS™\nRankOS™ functions as both a measurement platform and operating methodology , allowing NEWMEDIA.COM to assess how brands are interpreted by AI systems and to identify the specific signals preventing inclusion in AI-generated answers.\nThe platform evaluates:\nEntity Authority: how clearly and consistently a brand is defined\nCitation Strength: quality and volume of verifiable mentions\nVisibility Signals: structured data, profiles, and schema completeness\nAI Answer Share: frequency of brand inclusion across AI responses\nBy consolidating these metrics, RankOS™ provides businesses with a practical framework for AI Engine Optimization (AEO) .\n____\nA Market-Wide Shift\nAs AI platforms increasingly serve as the first point of discovery for consumers and B2B buyers, the benchmark suggests that AI visibility is emerging as a new competitive differentiator.\nNEWMEDIA.COM plans to release additional industry-specific and geographic benchmarks through the remainder of 2025 and throughout 2026.\n____\nAbout NEWMEDIA.COM\nFounded in 1996 , NEWMEDIA.COM is a nationally recognized digital agency specializing in strategy, design, development, and performance-driven marketing for growth-focused brands.

      "Content": "PANW Deepens Ties With Google: Will This Enhance Prisma AIRS Adoption?\n\nOm Jaiswal\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:43 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: PANW\n\nGOOG\n\nPalo Alto Networks PANW is strengthening its partnership with Google Cloud to support secure artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud adoption. This expanded partnership places Prisma AI Runtime Security (AIRS), Palo Alto Networks’ AI security platform, directly inside Google Cloud’s AI and developer services. The aim is to secure AI workloads from development through production.\n\nPalo Alto Networks recently announced that it is expanding its partnership with Google Cloud. Under the expanded partnership agreement, Palo Alto Networks’ Prisma AIRS will be integrated with Google Cloud services, such as Vertex AI and Agent Engine. This will allow customers to secure AI models, data, and agents while they are running on Google Cloud. The partnership also includes deeper use of Palo Alto Networks’ software firewalls and Secured Access Service Edge products on Google Cloud. This helps customers apply the same security policies across cloud, AI, and network environments.\nPrisma AIRS checks prompts, responses, and agent actions in real time. This helps reduce risks, such as prompt injection, data leakage, and misuse of tools. Because security is built directly into these platforms, customers do not need to deploy separate security products to protect AI agents. Apart from Google Cloud, PANW has integrated Prisma AIRS with several other AI agent platforms, including Factory, Glean, IBM, and ServiceNow. These integrations secure AI agents inside tools that customers already use.\n\nThe above-mentioned factors highlight the growing adoption of Prisma AIRS. Furthermore, the number of Prisma AIRS deals more than doubled on a sequential basis during the first quarter of fiscal 2026, highlighting Prisma AIRS’ rising usage.\nWith rising AI adoption and as customers shift toward more integrated platforms, Prisma AIRS’ surging usage could support PANW's future growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 and 2027 indicates revenue growth of around 14.1% and 13.3%, respectively.\nHow Competitors Fare Against PANW CrowdStrike CRWD and Okta Inc. OKTA are key players competing with CrowdStrike, which are focusing on partnerships and acquisitions for platform expansion and AI innovation.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2026, CrowdStrike expanded its partnership with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). CrowdStrike’s Falcon Next-Generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is now available directly inside AWS Security Hub. This means AWS customers can start using Falcon SIEM more easily, without extra setup. The management believes that this creates a larger pool of potential users and gives CrowdStrike more chances to turn usage into paid subscriptions, often through the Falcon Flex model.\n\nStory Continues\nOkta completed its acquisition of Axiom Security in September 2025. Through this acquisition, Okta has added new tools for privileged access management, helping customers control who can reach sensitive cloud, SaaS and database systems.\nPANW’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Palo Alto Networks have lost 10.2% in the past three months compared with the Zacks Security industry’s decline of 8.4%.\nPANW 3-month Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Palo Alto Networks trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 11.77X compared with the industry’s average of 11.79X.\nPANW Forward 12-Month P/S Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Palo Alto Networks’ fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 14.7% and 12.5%, respectively. Estimates for fiscal 2026 have been revised upward by 4 cents over the past 30 days, while the estimates for fiscal 2027 have been revised downward by a penny over the past seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPalo Alto Networks currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) autonomous driving operation, is widely considered the leader in the advance of self-driving car technology. Many believe its product is ahead of those of Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ), GM, and Ford. Waymo-powered cars have logged over 100 million “fully autonomous miles.” It now operates, or will soon, in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, Miami, District of Columbia, and Dallas. It also has limited tests in Tokyo.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points An incident during the recent blackout in San Francisco has harmed Waymo’s image as the self-driving leader.\nElon Musk took the opportunity to boast about Tesla’s self-driving technology.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAn incident during the recent blackout in San Francisco shattered Waymo’s image. According to The New York Times, “Waymo Suspended Service in San Francisco After Its Cars Stalled During Power Outage.” The vehicles stopped when traffic lights went out. Fortunately, that resulted in no injuries.\nTesla is betting heavily on its own self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk posted on X, “SAN FRAN BLACKOUT – WAYMO FROZE, TESLA DROVE Waymo’s robotaxis got a little too real last night - by completely shutting down when San Francisco’s power outage knocked out traffic lights.”\nTesla claims it will be the leader in the sector, despite skeptics whose opinions have largely been fueled by Waymo’s success. Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving (FSD)” is already in a number of its vehicles. However, to use it, drivers must keep their eyes on the road. Tesla’s first test of its self-driving robotaxi started in Austin early this year. Tesla plans to move into San Francisco, then to begin testing in Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and Miami.\n\nIt is an open question whether the Waymo problem is part of a temporary defect in its product. Yet, it would be hard to find an incident that would hurt it more or help Tesla’s chances, at least in the court of public opinion and among some experts.\nMusk has repeatedly bragged that no one can match his autonomous vehicle technology. Waymo had undermined that claim. According to CNBC, “Alphabet-owned Waymo kept expanding and dominated the robotaxi market in the U.S., though rivals Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox also launched the first versions of their services in 2025.”\nMusk’s comments about its self-driving future have been part of the rise in its share price since April. Waymo has given investors another reason to buy Tesla shares.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Only Seen Twice in 153 Years: History’s Clear Warning for the Stock Market in 2026\n\nDavid Beren\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIt should go without saying that the S&P 500 has been riding high over the last few years and has delivered one of the most impressive runs in market history. Over the past three years, the index has surged a whopping 80%, driven in part by artificial intelligence, falling interest rates, and ongoing corporate earnings growth. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolio balances have reached levels that might have seemed all but impossible to achieve a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 surged 80% over three years. This has occurred only twice before in 153 years.\nPrevious instances (1920s and 1990s) both preceded market crashes of 49% to 89%.\nThe S&P 500 forward P/E sits around 21 to 22. This is roughly 40% above historical averages.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnfortunately, any exceptional performance like this in the market comes with something of a warning label. A three-year gain of this kind of magnitude with the S&P 500 has only occurred twice in the last 153 years of stock market performance. The first, the 1920s bull market, and the late 1990s tech boom both ended in devastating fashion with the Great Depression and the dot-com bust.\nThankfully, history doesn't always guarantee repetition, but it does signal that a pattern could be forming in the sense that markets performing this well for this long could be a giant warning sign for investors. As 2026 gets closer, understanding what happened in the last two instances now just feels like understanding basic risk management.\nThe S&P 500's Ultra-Rare 3-Year Surge: What History Predicts If you look closely, the 80% gain over the last three years roughly translates to anywhere between a 21% and 27% annualized return, which is more than double the S&P 500's long-term average of approximately 10% in gains. The rarity of this occurrence cannot be overstated, considering it has only happened twice in the 153 years, with the 1927-1929 bull market rising 95% and the tech boom between 1995 and 1998 increased 85%.\n\nIf you're seeing giant warning signs today, it's because you know that what is taking place in the market today, performance-wise, is eerily familiar to what has happened before. In the 1920s, you had a market that boomed because of cars becoming more readily available, on top of electrification taking place across cities and non-cities alike. It was the promise of a new era, and the 1990s boom was driven by something similar, as the internet was being heralded as something that was going to transform everything we knew about technology, communication, and just about everything in between.\n\nStory Continues\nThe 80% surge between 2023 and 2025 is following the same pattern, and this is what is causing warning bells to go off. Unsurprisingly, AI is being heralded as the transforming technology, and valuations have expanded significantly as a result. This all feels very much like 1999, and AI is being labeled as the kind of technology that will change everything, just as the internet was heralded as something transforming, and electricity absolutely did transform everything. This all comes together with a clear message in that when the stock market delivers this kind of three-year performance, it precedes major reversals.\n\nAnalyzing the Historical Precedents for 2026 During the 1927 to 1929 surge, the market continued to climb well into September before it all came crashing down in October. The initial 48% decline happened between October and November, but the real impact was felt from the end of 1929 all the way toward the end of 1932, when the total market collapse took place, dropping the market by around 89% in total. Crazily enough, it would take 25 years before the market would return to its 1929 highs.\n\nFast forward to the 1995-1998 surge, the market continued to climb higher and higher through 1999 before it peaked in March 2020. The rest, as they say, is well-known history, as the dot com crash erased 49% of the S&P 500's value in just 2.5 years. The Nasdaq fell 78% and its overall recovery would take another seven years before returning to its starting levels.\nThe takeaway here is that there is a consistent pattern that was followed in both of these cases, in that the market didn't crash immediately after a three-year surge. The market rally actually, and surprisingly, as you look back, continued for an extra year, delivering even more gains before a severe decline. In 2026, the cautionary tale is that history suggests either the market delivers this year as one full of gains or one that shows indicators of a reversal. Suffice it to say, neither scenario paints a pretty picture, as even if investors get one more year of gains, the crash starts and wipes all the gains out.\n\nIs an AI Bubble Forming? The Biggest Risk Heading into 2026 If you have been watching the current level of AI enthusiasm, and who hasn't been, the parallels between today and previous tech bubbles are almost impossible to ignore. We are already seeing just how transformative AI can be, something that echoes what the country saw during the electrification of the 1920s and the internet in the 1990s. Sadly, real technology, no matter how transformative, doesn't always prevent bubbles. If anything, it actually enables a bubble to take place by trying to justify massive corporate valuations.\n\nThe biggest takeaway right now is that the signs of a bubble transformation are present, and they are present across multiple indicators. Valuations for AI-centric stocks are assuming nearly flawless execution and sustained growth continuing for years into the future. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) are all investing billions, tens of billions into AI infrastructure without a clear signal of what the return could be. As a result, the S&P 500's forward P/E is sitting around 21 to 22, approximately 40% above historical averages.\nIf you are a retail investor, and many of us are, this is something to be very aware of, as is options trading, which has seen its volume surge in AI stocks. Reddit, in particular, has come alive with discussion, especially on places like r/WallStreetBets, in a way that feels almost too familiar if you were on message boards during the dot-com era in 1999. On top of social media conversation, you also have companies adding \"AI\" anywhere they can in their core descriptions or even their company names to try and boost valuations. This closely mirrors when companies added \".com\" to their company names in the late 1990s to try to jump on a similar trend.\n\nThe bottom line is that any catalyst for a stock reversal could come from slower-than-anticipated AI adoption or even disappointing returns from AI investments. Add to all of these concerns over an economic slowdown resulting from tariffs, or even inflationary concerns, depending on how the Fed handles interest rates. This all comes together in what could be a perfect storm for either a massive buying shift or a major selling rally, and any instance of the latter is going to feed on itself as panic selling grabs hold until the bottom falls out.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

The milestone comes as the unit plans to raise more than $15 billion at a valuation of about $100 billion.\n\nThe valuation underscores Waymo’s emergence as a leader in driverless technology as the company continues to ramp up its fleet. Backed by Alphabet, Waymo remains in a solid position to take on Tesla and others in the autonomous ride-hailing business. It is currently the only company without a safety driver across multiple cities.\nMeanwhile, RBC Capital does not expect Alphabet to enter the real estate portal market. According to the research firm, the company faces significant barriers to entry, key among them being the MLS participation requirement. For starters, IDX feeds are designed for agents, not horizontal marketing platforms, which makes MLS approval problematic. To participate Google will have to become a broker in hundreds of MLS organizations.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a multinational tech conglomerate and holding company, best known as the parent of Google, managing core internet services (Search, Ads, YouTube, Android, Maps) under Google. It also boasts of other ventures like cloud computing (Google Cloud), hardware (Pixel, Nest), and “Other Bets” in areas like self-driving cars (Waymo) and life sciences (Calico).\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be the World's Largest Company by Year-End 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:21 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet has a comprehensive AI stack, owning nearly every component of the AI ecosystem.\nIts impressive growth has a long runway to continue as AI adoption spreads.\nThe stock's very reasonable valuation leaves plenty of room to overtake Nvidia's valuation in time.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) investment cycle, where companies are investing billions of dollars in data centers and other infrastructure, has propelled AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to its position as the world's largest company by market capitalization .\nIt's a remarkable feat, and it took the stock price rising nearly 1,000% in just three years to accomplish it. But it's difficult to stay atop the mountain, and a formidable challenger is looming. Initially, investors thought artificial intelligence would threaten tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nHowever, Google's parent company has seized the opportunity and become arguably the most complete AI stock on the market today.\nSo, this Fool is calling it now: Alphabet, not Nvidia, will be the world's largest company in 2026. I state my case below.\nEnvious competitive positioning as the full-stack AI player The AI landscape is still in its early chapters. A lot will happen over the next decade or two, so it's not easy to make many predictions with much confidence. That said, Alphabet could have the strongest argument for a leading role in AI's future.\nIt wouldn't be a stretch to call Alphabet the world's most prominent internet company. It's known for its dominant Google search engine, but in reality, Alphabet's empire casts a far longer shadow. Its chief assets include:\n\nYouTube, the largest streaming platform.\nGoogle Chrome, a leading web browser.\nAndroid, a leading smartphone operating software.\nGoogle Workspace, a collection of internet apps with over 3 billion users.\nThese assets provide Alphabet with key insights and data on most of the world's web users, a crucial resource for developing and training its AI models. Additionally, Alphabet's Google Cloud is the world's third-largest cloud computing services platform, and the company has created custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), for its data centers.\nIn other words, Alphabet owns a comprehensive AI ecosystem that gives it a significant competitive advantage over most other AI companies, which typically own only pieces of an ecosystem.\n\nPlenty of growth still to come Some AI hyperscalers have had to take on substantial debt to fund their data center investments. Not Alphabet, which has primarily funded its investments with profits thanks to its various established businesses that generate cash flow like few companies on the planet can.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Alphabet's core businesses continue to thrive. Revenue from digital advertising through Google and YouTube grew by roughly 15% year over year in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Google Cloud revenue increased by 34% as AI usage drives cloud demand.\nAssuming AI adoption continues to spread throughout society, especially among consumers using AI apps, that growth doesn't seem likely to slow down anytime soon. That's before considering Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary, which continues to expand into new markets and is now seeking funding to accelerate its growth efforts.\n\nAll in all, Wall Street analysts estimate Alphabet will grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 16% over the next three to five years.\nThe stock's valuation is reasonable and has room to run Nvidia certainly has strong growth prospects as well, but some of its customers, such as OpenAI and Oracle , are facing scrutiny for how they will fund their massive AI commitments. In other words, it appears that Nvidia's growth is more fragile because it relies on a small number of customers. For Alphabet, AI adds additional upside to its established cloud and digital ads businesses.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's market cap of $4.3 trillion is just 16% higher than Alphabet's. Alphabet currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, using full-year earnings estimates, a reasonable price tag for high-teens annualized earnings growth, especially for a world-class company with multiple highly profitable businesses.\nThat leaves room for the stock to continue higher through 2026 if Alphabet's businesses continue to perform well. If confidence in Nvidia's growth dips, I could see Alphabet overtaking it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

( NYSE:UBER ) and Lyft Inc. ( NASDAQ:LYFT ) are pushing further into autonomous mobility by separately partnering with Baidu Inc. ( NASDAQ:BIDU ) to trial driverless taxis in the UK, as ride-hailing platforms look to position themselves for the next phase of urban transport. Uber said Monday that a pilot using Baidu's Apollo Go RT6 robotaxis is set to begin in London in the first half of 2026, with commercial services in the city expected before the end of next year. In parallel, Lyft Chief Executive Officer David Risher said in a post on X that Lyft plans to test dozens of the same vehicles in the UK next year, pending regulatory approval.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with UBER.\nIs UBER fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThese initiatives come as robotaxi rollouts continue to expand globally, led by Chinese companies such as Baidu and Weride Inc., alongside Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo. Uber and Weride have already launched driverless operations in Abu Dhabi and are planning additional expansion across the Middle East, while Baidu is running autonomous trials in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Switzerland. Waymo also began testing in London this month, highlighting how autonomous driving developers are increasingly operating across borders as they seek regulatory pathways and commercial scale.\nUber exited internal autonomous driving development in 2020 and has since focused on partnerships with specialized robotaxi operators. Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a Bloomberg Television interview this month that Uber plans to offer driverless services in more than 10 markets by the end of next year. Lyft appears to be following a similar approach and has already signed an agreement with Baidu to roll out robotaxis in Europe, while Grab is partnering with Weride and Momenta in Southeast Asia. Even so, the long-term profitability of the robotaxi model remains uncertain, with listed autonomous vehicle companies such as Pony AI Inc. ( NASDAQ:PONY ) and Weride still reporting losses after raising funds through share sales.\n\nCondiciones y Política de privacidad\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Alphabet Inc\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $270.81. It's currently trading at a price of $307.16. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -13.42%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$8.67\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 24.30% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n170.15\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n191.11\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n270.81\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $187.72. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -63.63%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What Is One of the Best AI Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2026 and Beyond?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's core business is thriving.\nIt may consider selling its custom chips to outside clients.\nThe company has emerged as a leader in generative AI.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIdentifying which artificial intelligence (AI) stock has the most potential in 2026 and beyond is no simple task. If your time frame after 2026 is only a few years, then an AI infrastructure company like Nvidia may be the best option. If your time frame runs for a decade after 2026, you may be better off with a software company like Palantir .\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a combination of these two options, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is one of the best AI stocks to buy and hold.\nAlphabet has had a stellar year, rising around 60% so far in 2025. I don't expect that performance to repeat in 2026, but I still think it has market-beating potential.\nIts core business is thriving Alphabet's primary business is the Google Search engine. At the start of 2025, a large majority of investors assumed that generative AI technologies would replace Google. However, Alphabet saw the writing on the wall and made swift changes.\nThe biggest innovation was the integration of AI-powered Overviews in Google Search. These provide nearly every search result with a generative-AI summary at the top of the page, giving the user a hybrid experience.\n\nFor many, these will be the most AI capabilities that they need. For others, Google's generative AI model, Gemini, has emerged as a top option in the space.\nIn one year, Gemini has risen from the laughingstock of the AI world to one of the best. Its improvements were so impressive that they forced OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, to declare a \"code red\" at the company. That's a long way from where Gemini was viewed entering 2025, and the change in fortunes for both the Google Search business and the progress of Alphabet's generative AI model can be thanked for its stock performance.\nAnother area that boosted Alphabet's stock was the performance of its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which is building out excess computing capacity to rent to those who cannot build their own data centers. Within Google Cloud, Alphabet provides access to its custom tensor processing units (TPUs), which can outperform graphics processing units (GPUs) when the workload is properly configured.\nThese computing units have been Alphabet's secret weapons in training its cutting-edge generative AI models, and locking access to them behind one of its other business units is genius. However, management may be exploring alternative territory.\n\nStory Continues\nReportedly, the company is considering selling its TPUs to Meta Platforms outright instead of requiring it to rent access to them via Google Cloud. That's a step in a different direction and could result in a new revenue stream that investors haven't accounted for. The AI computing market is huge, and if Alphabet can secure a sliver, it could provide serious growth.\n\nTime will tell if this business venture pans out, but Alphabet is doing incredibly well as a company. It's also spending responsibly, which is something that not every company can say.\nAlphabet has plenty of cash to fund its build-outs One of the growing concerns in the AI realm is a potential bubble forming around building AI computing capacity. There are questions about how AI hyperscalers will fund it, which is a perfectly acceptable question to ask of a company like OpenAI. However, Alphabet has plenty of cash flow to continue building data centers as it pleases.\n\nThe two metrics that inventors in this realm should familiarize themselves with are operating cash flow and free cash flow. Operating cash flow is all of the cash that a business produces, which can be used to fund capital expenditures (capex). Free cash flow subtracts capex, which shows the remaining cash a business has to repurchase shares, pay down debt, or fund dividends.\nAlphabet has plenty of cash to continue spending on AI data centers if it chooses, which is a great position to be in. While it is spending a lot of its cash on build-outs, it has plenty left before it risks dropping into negative figures. That's a huge advantage the company has over nearly any other competitor in the AI race, and it's the primary reason I think Alphabet is one of the best AI stocks to buy in 2026 and hold for several years after.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "A $6 billion nuclear deal has Trump’s name all over it. It’s raising serious ethics concerns\n\nMatt Egan, CNN\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: WSFX.BO\n\nTATE.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nThe Trump business empire’s expansion into nuclear fusion is alarming ethics experts, who warn it poses glaring conflicts of interest and risks the federal government playing favorites in what could be the holy grail of clean energy.\nTrump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ) shocked Wall Street last week by arranging a $6 billion marriage with TAE Technologies , a Google-backed company at the leading edge of fusion energy.\n\nThe merger means that soon, President Donald Trump will simultaneously have a major financial interest in a company whose fortunes will be influenced by the actions of a government that Trump himself presides over.\nNuclear fusion companies are regulated by the federal government and will likely need Uncle Sam’s deep research and even deeper pockets to become commercially viable. The merger needs to be approved by federal regulators – some of whom were nominated by Trump.\n“There is a clear conflict of interest here,” Richard Painter, the top ethics official under former President George W. Bush, told CNN in a phone interview. “Every other president since the Civil War has divested from business interests that would conflict with official duties. President Trump has done the opposite.”\n\nPainter, who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said anyone other than the president or the vice president could be committing a crime if they participated in a US government matter that they knew they had a financial interest in.\nFor instance, he said the secretary of energy would have to recuse him or herself from any matter linked to fusion if they simultaneously had a significant stake in a fusion company.\n“It’s only legal because the criminal conflict of interest statute does not apply to the president,” Painter said, adding that while it is “technically legal” he doesn’t believe presidents should be excluded from the law.\nAn instant $500 million boost to Trump’s fortune The fusion deal caused an immediate boost to Trump’s net worth.\nTrump Media’s share price skyrocketed 42% when the merger was announced on Thursday. That increased the value of the stake Trump owns through a trust, by $500 million to $1.7 billion. Trump Media’s share price continued to climb Friday, increasing the value of that stake to above $1.8 billion.\nSome on Wall Street are betting the deal will create a halo effect for TAE.\nTAE will “clearly have major political support from President Trump in our view and this importantly will create a major nuclear fusion US energy domestic bet over the coming years,” Dan Ives, a veteran tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, told clients in a note last week.\n\nStory Continues\nHarnessing the power of the stars Fusion is a futuristic form of energy that aims to replicate the same process that powers the sun and other stars. It has long been viewed as a potential game-changer because it would provide almost limitless clean energy.\nHowever, fusion is not yet commercially viable, and to get it off the ground it may need support from the federal government in the form of loans, subsidies, contracts and research.\n\nThat’s why the public interest could be harmed if the merger creates an unfair advantage for Trump-backed TAE, worries Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who studies government ethics.\n“The risk is that one company will end up being a government favorite, not because of objective scientistic evaluation, but because they paid off the president,” Clark said. “It reminds me of the Soviet Union appointing scientists based on their claimed ideology, not their actual achievement.”\n‘Bad for humanity’ Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who co-chairs the House Fusion Energy Caucus, told CNN in a phone interview that he was “stunned” by the Trump Media deal.\n“I hate the thought of a president who puts his name on the Kennedy Center putting his foot on the scale of who the winners and losers are in fusion energy,” Beyer said.\n\nBeyer said he has been “encouraged” by the Energy Department’s support for fusion energy and is pleased to have a president supportive of the industry.\nThe Trump administration in October released a Fusion Science and Technology Roadmap that “aims to usher a burgeoning fusion private sector industry in the US toward maturity on the most rapid timeline.”\nBut Beyer noted there are more than two dozen fusion companies operating in the United States, some of which are further along in development than TAE.\n“If the Trump engagement means the whole industry proceeds more quickly, that’s a win for humanity,” Beyer said. “But if it means everyone else is going to be disadvantaged and the government’s largesse will focus on one company, that is bad for humanity and bad for America.”\n\nFusion CEO: Not looking for ‘special’ treatment The White House rejected concerns about a conflict of interest.\n“The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read. Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement to CNN.\nNeither the Energy Department nor the Trump Organization responded to requests for comment.\nMichl Binderbauer, the CEO of TAE, told CNN that he decided to merge with Trump Media because it offered the “last piece of the puzzle” in their quest to build a power plant: capital.\n“Sometimes you get lucky and you meet the right people,” he said.\n\nBinderbauer said he isn’t concerned that any government support his company needs or receives will become politically controversial because he’s joined forces with Trump.\n“I’m not looking for anything special,” he said.\nDonald J. Trump Revocable Trust After winning the election last fall, Trump transferred his dominant stake in Trump Media to the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust.\nTrump is the sole beneficiary of that trust, which is controlled by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who also plans to sit on the combined company’s board of directors .\nClark said the transfer to a trust is irrelevant when it comes to a conflict of interest.\n\n“It’s utterly meaningless. As a matter of ethics, it’s BS,” she said.\nPainter, the former Bush ethics official, agrees the transfer to a trust doesn’t matter because Trump still has a financial interest.\n“That’s like saying, ‘I don’t own a piece of property just because I hired a property manager to take care of it,’” Painter said.\nPainter said there is a simple way for Trump to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n“He should divest. Divest from nuclear fusion, social media and cryptocurrency,” Painter said.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "$7.7 Billion of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Is Invested in 2 Quantum Computing Stocks\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Buffett owns two quantum computing stocks -- Alphabet and Amazon.\nBoth companies focus on much more than just quantum computing, of course.\nAlphabet and Amazon are good picks for other investors, too.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nNobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Richard Feynman once stated, \"No one understands quantum mechanics.\" I mention Feynman's quote because many investors are excited about quantum computing stocks these days – and quantum computing is based on the principles of (you probably guessed it) quantum mechanics.\n\nThat leads me to another quote, in this case a statement made by Warren Buffett: \"Never invest in a business you cannot understand.\" Buffett has also written about only investing in companies within your \"circle of competence.\"\nWith all of this in mind, you might think that Buffett wouldn't touch a quantum computing stock with a 10-foot pole. However, $7.7 billion of his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio is invested in two quantum computing stocks.\nBuffett's two quantum computing stocks Has Buffett quietly bought shares of D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) , IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) , or Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) ? Nope. I doubt that he'd give any of these up-and-coming quantum computing stocks a second of his attention. However, the legendary investor has acquired shares in two other companies that are investing heavily in quantum computing.\n\nIn 2019, Berkshire initiated a new position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . Buffett later acknowledged that one of the conglomerate's two investment managers decided to buy Amazon. But Buffett also admitted that he had been \"an idiot\" for not investing in the company earlier.\nAmazon is a bigger player in quantum computing than you might think. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers Amazon Braket, a cloud service that allows researchers to test quantum computing algorithms, test quantum hardware, and develop quantum software. Amazon also introduced its Ocelot quantum computing chip earlier this year. Ocelet supports quantum error reduction by up to 90%.\nBuffett has also expressed regret for not investing in Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , earlier. He corrected that mistake in 2025. Berkshire bought over 17.8 million shares of the tech giant.\n\nAlphabet's Google Quantum AI is another pioneer in the field of quantum computing. In 2019, the unit developed a quantum system that performed a calculation in 200 seconds that it said \"would have taken the best-known algorithms in the most powerful supercomputers at the time 10,000 years to accomplish.\" Google Quantum AI also demonstrated the first logical qubit prototype in 2023.\n\nStory Continues\nMore than quantum computing Today, Berkshire's stakes in these two quantum computing stocks amount to around $7.7 billion. However, Buffett and his team didn't buy shares of Amazon or Alphabet because of their quantum computing initiatives. I doubt that the companies' quantum computing efforts even factored into the investing decisions at all.\n\nAmazon's dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing was a significant attraction for Berkshire when it first invested in the company in 2019. Over six years later, Amazon remains the No. 1 player in both markets.\nAlphabet is, at its heart, an advertising company. Ads on Google Search, YouTube, the Google Network, and other apps generate roughly 72% of Alphabet's total revenue. While Buffett may not fully understand quantum computing and other advanced technologies, he certainly has a firm grasp of advertising.\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet offer more than their core businesses, though. For example, Amazon is preparing to launch a satellite internet service. Google Cloud is a key growth driver for Alphabet. Also, the company's famous \"other bets\" include self-driving car leader Waymo and high-speed internet provider GFiber.\n\nAre Alphabet and Amazon good stocks to buy? Don't buy Alphabet and Amazon just because Buffett owns the stocks. However, I think both are good picks for many investors.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) presents a massive tailwind for AWS and Google Cloud. Amazon and Google should especially profit as the adoption of agentic AI grows. Both giants have significant opportunities in the robotaxi market.\n\nBuffett's two quantum computing stocks are more than just investments in quantum computing. However, I think Alphabet and Amazon could be big winners as quantum computing advances – whether you understand the technology or not.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

This has prompted fresh questions about valuation.\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet.\nThe backdrop is a strong year of execution in search, YouTube, and especially cloud, and the latest 1 day share price gain of 1.55% suggests momentum is still building after a powerful multi year total shareholder return.\n\nIf Alphabet’s move has you thinking more broadly about tech, now could be a good time to explore high growth tech and AI stocks for other potential growth stories.\nWith revenue and profits still growing double digits and the stock trading just below average analyst targets, investors face a key question: Is Alphabet still undervalued, or is the market already pricing in its next leg of growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 9.7% Undervalued According to oscargarcia, the narrative fair value of $340 sits above Alphabet’s last close at $307.16, framing the stock as modestly mispriced.\nGoogle’s balance sheet is like a bunker built with gold bricks.

      "Content": "These Infrastructure Stocks Could Quietly Power the AI Revolution\n\nMatt DiLallo, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NEE\n\nBEPC\n\nBAM\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points The AI revolution will require a lot of power in the coming years.\nGoogle has signed energy deals with NextEra and Brookfield Renewable.\nBrookfield has also signed a long-term renewable energy development agreement with Microsoft.\n10 stocks we like better than NextEra Energy ›\nTechnology companies are investing a substantial amount of money in hardware, processors, and memory storage to support AI. According to an estimate by McKinsey, companies need to invest a staggering $5.2 trillion by 2030 on data centers equipped to handle AI processing loads.\n\nHowever, technology is only part of the story. Power is quietly becoming a major factor in driving the AI revolution because AI data centers consume an enormous amount of electricity. As a result, leading energy infrastructure companies such as NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) are emerging as leaders in powering the AI revolution.\nPartnering with AI leaders NextEra Energy owns the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light) and one of the largest energy infrastructure development companies (NextEra Energy Resources). The energy resources segment owns and develops energy infrastructure, including electricity transmission lines and power generation facilities, to support third-party demand.\n\nThe company has become a key partner of choice for technology companies to help power their AI strategies over the past year. In October, NextEra Energy signed a new collaboration with Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to accelerate nuclear energy deployment in the U.S. As part of the partnership, NextEra Energy will restart its dormant Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa to support Google's growing power needs. The tech titan has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to purchase the bulk of the power produced by the facility upon its return to commercial service in the first quarter of 2029.\nNextEra and Google also announced a significant expansion of their energy and technology collaboration in December. They will partner on developing multiple gigawatt (GW)-scale data center campuses in the future with accompanying generation and capacity. NextEra will supply the energy expertise, while Google will bring its data center development capabilities to the partnership.\nNextEra Energy is also working with Meta Platforms to help power its AI operations. Meta Platforms recently signed 11 PPAs and two energy storage agreements. NextEra will develop several solar energy projects for Meta, totaling 2.5 GW of power-producing capacity.\n\nStory Continues\nMassive power deals Brookfield Renewable is a leading global renewable energy producer . It sells the power it produces to utilities and large corporations under long-term PPAs.\nEarlier this year, Brookfield announced a first-of-its-kind Hydro Framework Agreement with Google. The cloud giant will purchase up to 3 GW of carbon-free hydroelectric power from the company in the future, marking the largest-ever hydropower deal. The first two 20-year PPAs represent over $3 billion of power and cover Brookfield's Holtwood and Safe Harbor hydroelectric facilities in Pennsylvania, which have a combined generating capacity of 670 megawatts.\n\nBrookfield also signed a first-of-its-kind global renewable energy framework with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) last year. The five-year agreement will see Brookfield develop over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity for the technology giant in the 2026 through 2030 time frame across the U.S. and Europe. It's eight times bigger than the largest single corporate PPA ever signed. The deal will provide Microsoft with a pipeline of renewable energy capacity to support growing demand for its cloud and AI services. The companies have the potential to expand their collaboration to Asia-Pacific, India, and Latin America in the future, as well as to new or impactful carbon-free energy sources beyond wind and solar.\nAdditionally, Brookfield Renewable has an investment in Westinghouse Electric, a nuclear technology company . The U.S. Government recently signed a strategic partnership with Westinghouse to build at least $80 billion of new nuclear reactors in the country using the company's technology. These plants will help support the country's growing AI power needs.\n\nThe power behind the AI revolution NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable are two of the world's largest clean power producers. They have the electricity production capacity and development capabilities to meet the growing power needs of AI. That's leading tech titans Google, Meta, Microsoft, and others to join forces with these energy companies to help fuel the AI revolution. These deals will provide technology companies with the energy they need, while potentially powering robust total returns for investors in NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable in the coming years.\n\nShould you buy stock in NextEra Energy right now?

However, after a recent pullback, shares briefly moved below $300 and are still close to that level as of Dec. 19.\nMany investors may be wondering if they should buy shares now or wait to see if Alphabet falls further, considering the recent dip in the tech sector. Personally, I wouldn't wait. Here's why.\nThe benefit of investing in great companies It's hard to find many tech companies as dominant as Alphabet. The holding company is most famous for owning Google, the world's largest search engine, but it also owns the most popular web browser (Chrome), video streaming site (YouTube), and mobile operating system (Android). Among the other businesses that Alphabet owns are Waymo, a self-driving car company, and Wing, a drone delivery service.\n\nAlphabet generated $73.6 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over its past four reported quarters. And even with all of its successes, it remains a more affordable investment than many of the other megacap tech stocks. Trading at 29 times trailing earnings as of Dec. 17, it's the second-cheapest company among the \"Magnificent Seven\" (which also include Apple , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia , and Tesla ).\nAlphabet has historically outperformed the stock market. Based on the strength of its businesses, it looks likely to keep doing so.\nThis isn't your last chance to buy Alphabet, and truthfully, its share price could go up or down in the short term. The current price might not be the very lowest it will go in the near future. But when you're investing in great companies, you don't need to worry about timing the market. What's important is filling your portfolio with long-term winners -- not whether you bought their shares at $295, $305, or somewhere in that area.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other S&P 500 Company. Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Alphabet vs. Amazon: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:52 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet was able to change investor perception in 2025, leading to huge gains in the stock.\nAmazon has the same opportunity to do that in 2026.\nBoth stocks trade at attractive valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nTwo of the big three cloud computing companies are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . While both Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) have seen solid growth, Alphabet's stock far outpaced Amazon's in 2025, climbing nearly 60% as of this writing, versus a modest gain for Amazon.\nLet's look at which stock is set to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Alphabet Alphabet has been one of the best-performing mega-cap tech stocks in 2025, largely because it was able to flip the script from being viewed as an AI loser to perhaps having the potential to be one of the biggest AI winners. While the company turned in some strong numbers, its performance was much more about changing perceptions.\n\nIt did this largely through the advancements with its Gemini foundational large language model (LLM) and custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Gemini has become one of the best LLMs in the market today, and Alphabet has infused it throughout its products, including its core search business. AI-powered features, like AI Overviews, AI Mode, and Lens, have helped the company accelerate its search revenue, while its Gemini stand-alone app has also gained traction.\nAt the same time, its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) have become increasingly viewed as one of the top alternative AI chips to Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are in their seventh generation, and Alphabet uses them to power much of its internal workloads, giving it a huge structural cost advantage. Meanwhile, the chips are so highly regarded that Anthropic has committed to buying $21 billion worth of them next year.\n\nAs time progresses, the advantage Alphabet has of owning both top-notch AI chips and a top-tier LLM should only widen, as it creates a powerful flywheel that will make both better over time.\nThe case for Amazon While Alphabet was able to change investor perceptions this year, Amazon was not. However, the company could now be in a similar spot to where Alphabet was heading into 2025.\nMuch of Amazon's lackluster recent performance can be tied to the growth of AWS, which trails that of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. However, Amazon saw AWS revenue growth accelerate to 20% last quarter, and the company said it was capacity-constrained. As such, it's boosting its capital expenditure (capex) budget to try to meet growing demand.\n\nStory Continues\nAt the same time, the data center that it built for Anthropic, featuring its custom Trainium chips, is still ramping up. It is also in talks with OpenAI about making an investment in the company, where OpenAI would start to use some of its AI chips. The two companies already signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal, although that was to use Nvidia GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce business is really clicking. The company is seeing huge operating leverage come from its robotics and AI investments, while its high-margin sponsored ad business is growing quickly from a large base. This could be seen in its third-quarter results, as its North America revenue rose 11%, while its segment adjusted operating income soared 28%.\nThe verdict Alphabet and Amazon are two of my favorite stocks heading into 2026. Both stocks are trading at attractive valuations with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) of below 30 times and solid growth prospects ahead.\nI think Alphabet is going to become one of the biggest winners in AI over the long term, but for 2026, I think Amazon's stock can outperform. As AWS revenue continues to accelerate and Trainium gains some traction, Amazon can begin to shift perceptions, much like Alphabet did last year. I think that will really help power a stock that is trading well below other leading retailers like Walmart and Costco, which have forward P/Es nearing 40 times.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

He believes that Google’s immense power and business model could pose a significant threat in the AI space.\nAltman Warns of Google's AI Power Altman, in a conversation with Alex Kantrowitz on the Big Technology Podcast , highlighted the potential danger that Google’s AI capabilities pose.\n“Google is still a huge threat…you know extremely powerful company,” stated Altman.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nHe reflected on the situation in 2023 when Google’s AI efforts were not as effective due to their product direction. Altman suggested that if Google had chosen to focus on OpenAI at that time, the latter would have been in a “really bad place.”\n“I think they would have just been able to smash us,” stated the OpenAI CEO.\n\nAltman also noted that Google’s business model is one of the strongest in the tech industry, and he believes that the company will be slow to relinquish it.\nHowever, he expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of Google simply integrating AI into existing systems like web search, suggesting that a complete redesign with AI at the forefront would be more successful.\n\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nAI Shake-Up Puts OpenAI Under Pressure Altman’s remarks come amid a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

The CNBC host had posted, \"It was only a matter of time before we heard from OpenAI about how it fell behind, and the rush of tens of millions of users right to Gemini 3 would be upon us.\"\n\nAltman’s analysis of Google also comes amid reports that OpenAI was eyeing a potential $1 trillion IPO, with the AI startup in discussions with investors for a $100 billion fundraise at a $750 billion valuation.\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

      "Content": "As Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\n\nEbube Jones\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThe global artificial intelligence (AI) data-center market is projected to rise from roughly $236 billion in 2025 to $933 billion by 2030, a 31.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).​ That surge in infrastructure demand is exactly what Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google is targeting with its Gemini platform, and the new Gemini 3 Flash release is designed to deliver faster, more efficient AI that can run at scale.\n\nWall Street is starting to assign larger price targets to the stock. Pivotal Research recently lifted its price target on Alphabet to $400 from $350, reiterating a “Buy” rating and flagging roughly 25% upside from current levels. The call leans on multi-year Google Cloud growth and strengthening free cash flow as key supports for Gemini-driven expansion.\nMore News from Barchart Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling? JPMorgan Says This ‘Overall Top Pick’ Is Better.\nThe Saturday Spread: How a Little-Known Options Strategy Targets Asymmetric Upside (ORCL, NEE, IRM)\nThe 2 Riskiest Stocks Investors Are Betting On With Over 300% Upside\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWith AI expectations rising and GOOGL already re-rating higher in 2025, the stakes around each Gemini release keep climbing. So, as Gemini 3 Flash rolls out, is this the moment to buy, simply hold tight, or start taking profits in GOOGL stock? Let's find out.\nThe Numbers Behind GOOGL Alphabet is a California‑based global technology company that builds search, cloud, advertising, hardware, and AI products at mass scale.\nThe stock currently trades at $307.16, up 62.3% year‑to‑date. The market capitalization of roughly $3.7 trillion and a price‑to‑sales (P/S) ratio of 10.6x versus a sector median of 1.2x shows how much of a premium the market is willing to pay.\nAlphabet's latest earnings report showed third‑quarter net income of roughly $35 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.87 versus a $2.26 consensus, a 27% upside surprise. The company posted total revenue of $102.3 billion, with Google Services and Google Cloud contributing $87.1 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively.\n\nThe report also included GAAP operating income of about $31.2 billion, reflecting a 30.5% operating margin. Meanwhile, adjusting for a $3.5 billion European Commission fine pushed operating income to about $34.7 billion and the margin close to 33.9%, showing that scale efficiencies are offsetting higher AI‑related costs. That level of profitability translated into free cash flow of roughly $24.5 billion for the quarter and left Alphabet with close to $100 billion in cash and marketable securities, giving it ample firepower to fund Gemini 3 Flash.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL’s Proof-of-Demand Recently, Gemini secured a major win in the form of a contract with the Pentagon. That kind of validation matters more now because Gemini 3 Flash aims to push faster AI performance into real workflows — not just demos.\nOn the infrastructure front, Google Cloud’s landmark strategic partnership with NextEra Energy (NEE) aims to develop multiple gigawatt‑scale data center campuses in the U.S., each paired with dedicated generation and capacity. This collaboration indicates a deliberate effort to secure massive, long‑lasting footprints for power and data centers. The arrangement also deepens Google Cloud’s role within NextEra itself, using Google’s AI and infrastructure to drive an enterprise‑wide digital transformation.\n\nIn terms of commercial services, Colliers (CIGI) has selected Google Cloud as its primary cloud platform as part of a multi‑year plan centered on advanced analytics and AI‑powered products. That migration will move the firm's core systems onto Google Cloud to enable AI‑driven tools, predictive modeling, and integrated workflows across a data‑intensive, regulated industry. The deal is explicitly framed around Gemini‑powered automation and smarter market intelligence for roughly 24,000 Colliers professionals.\nFinally, ReNew Energy Global’s long‑term agreement with Google will back a 150 MW solar project in Rajasthan dedicated to Google’s electricity needs in India. This project adds to an already sizable renewable portfolio. More importantly, it tackles one of the most significant constraints on AI growth by securing reliable, low‑carbon power at scale close to where computing is needed.\n\nHow Wall Street Prices GOOGL Wall Street is lining up behind GOOGL ahead of its next earnings report. For the current quarter, the average EPS estimate sits at $2.59, up from $2.12 a year ago. Looking at next quarter, the EPS estimate is $2.52 versus $2.81 last year, a decline that cools near-term expectations.\nFrom a full-year perspective, the story looks more in sync with the bullish narrative. For fiscal year 2025, the average EPS estimate is $10.58 compared to $8.04 for the previous year, implying a hefty 31.6% increase.\nOn the ratings side, the Street’s stance on GOOGL is about as clear as it gets. Across 54 analyst opinions, the consensus rating is a “Strong Buy.\" The average price target is $329.08, implying upside from its current price.\nConclusion GOOGL looks like a “buy on strength, add on dips” story rather than a stock to dump after Gemini 3 Flash. Strong earnings, solid cash flow, and healthy growth estimates support that case. A broadly bullish analyst consensus with double‑digit upside also points to shares grinding higher over the next year, even if the pace cools versus the last 12 months. Most likely, the stock will continue to trend upward with pauses around earnings and AI headlines, rewarding patient buyers more than short‑term traders.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Alphabet's performance can be tied to multiple successes, including the continued dominance of its core business, Google Search; developing a leading generative AI model in Gemini; and considering selling its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to outside clients.\n\nThose are all significant developments that have answered many outstanding questions surrounding Alphabet's stock at the start of 2025, clearing the way for another successful year in 2026. Wall Street analysts expect Alphabet to grow its revenue by nearly 14% next year, which is impressive considering its business maturity. That isn't going to dramatically outperform the market, but it should be enough to propel Alphabet over the 10% threshold that many investors wish to exceed when picking individual stocks.\nAlphabet has transformed from an artificial intelligence laggard to an AI leader in 2026, and I believe that trend will continue to power the stock higher in 2026 and beyond.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Keeping up with which company is providing the best computing unit possible is exhausting. While Nvidia and its graphics processing units (GPUs) have dominated so far, other companies like Alphabet are starting to challenge its dominance. This sparring will go back and forth forever, but what won't change is where most of the chips are sourced from.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest foundry by revenue and is the primary source for high-end computing chips, such as those used in various computing units within AI data centers. As long as AI hyperscalers continue to build out their AI computing power, Taiwan Semiconductor will remain an excellent investment. With the AI hyperscalers informing investors that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, this thesis is on track.\n\nStory Continues\nTaiwan Semiconductor also trades for less than 23 times next year's earnings, making it the cheapest company on this list. Taiwan Semiconductor is set up for a great 2026 with all of the massive spending occurring, positioning it as a great stock to buy now.\nAmazon Amazon has had a disappointing 2025, with the stock essentially flat for the year. That's frustrating for investors, especially when stocks like Taiwan Semiconductor and Alphabet have done so well. However, this sets the stage for a comeback in 2026, especially behind the strength of its growing business units.\n\nWhile most view Amazon as an e-commerce company, that segment doesn't provide the majority of the profits. Instead, its cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services (AWS), does. In Q3, AWS generated the majority of Amazon's operating profits while growing revenue at a 20% pace. That's faster than the companywide 13% growth rate. When the most profitable business unit is also growing faster than the overall business, that's an excellent sign for investors.\nAnother area to watch is Amazon's advertising business. Amazon's ad business is the company's fastest-growing division, rising 24% in Q3. It has also grown to become a huge part of the business, allowing it to boost Amazon's margins as well.\nThe continued strength of both segments is key for 2026, and if they continue to do well, Amazon will make a comeback and be an excellent stock to buy and hold in 2026.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

Despite the recent multiple compression, the firm is constructive on the stock driven by key near-term catalysts.\nBoFA noted how Meta has lagged the broader market and some of its biggest peers despite analysts having raised Meta’s 2026 earnings estimates. Investors have grown cautious on the stock amid concerns about AI spending and rising operating costs.\nStock market charts. Photo by Kaboompics.com on Pexels\nDespite these concerns, the firm finds Meta’s 2026 expense guidance and LLM launch in the first half of 2026 as potential near term catalysts. Looking ahead, investors will remain focused on AI investment spend and the returns these investments may generate across core apps, advertising monetization, and new business opportunities.\nThe firm also mentioned in their investor note how management’s commentary regarding costs to build LLMs compared to licensing can help improve sentiment.\nMeta Platforms has been expanding its advertising capabilities and also invests heavily in artificial intelligence and the metaverse.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Business\nA $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\n\nFaizan Farooque\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAmazon is increasingly aggressive and smart in its battle to acquire a greater role in AI .\nAmazon will reportedly make a huge $10 billion investment in OpenAI, which shocked Wall Street and rattled Silicon Valley. If the Reuters report is confirmed in the not-so-distant future, the deal won't simply be about getting in on the hottest name in AI.\n\nIt would mean that Amazon is willing to put real money behind its chips, cloud, and reputation, even if it has long been seen as behind in the AI arms race.\nIt's also an uncommon move for Amazon that will have ramifications for chip stocks, cloud computing, and the planned OpenAI IPO .\nAmazon's AI problem and how $10 billion could fix it Amazon is a cloud powerhouse thanks to AWS, but when it comes to high-profile AI projects, it has fallen behind Microsoft and Google.\nYears ago, Microsoft put $13 billion into OpenAI. Google is sponsoring both its own DeepMind subsidiary and its competitor Anthropic.\nAs for Amazon, people have spoken a lot about its Trainium and Inferentia chips and released services like Bedrock, but investors weren't very impressed — until now.\n\nRelated: Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nIf Amazon invests in OpenAI, it will get one of the world's most valuable AI workloads.\nOpenAI previously inked a $38 billion cloud agreement with AWS , but this arrangement might go much further and require OpenAI to employ Amazon's proprietary processors. That goes directly against Nvidia 's supremacy and strongly supports Trainium's claim of low cost and high performance.\nIt also has a number of strategic uses:\nGets AWS a big-name AI customer.\nShows Wall Street that Amazon's story about bespoke silicon is true.\nTells clients that Amazon is decreasing the cost of AI computing.\nPortrays Amazon as a legitimate \"AI arms dealer\" with tangible infrastructure.\nAnd the market saw it. The revelation made Amazon's stock rise, and some experts say this is when investors started to see Amazon as a real \"AI play.\"\n\nA high-stakes deal, just as the cloud gets crowded The timing couldn't be better. AWS is still the leader in cloud market share , but it is seeing more competition from Microsoft, Google, and fast-growing \"neo-cloud\" firms such as CoreWeave and Crusoe.\nBig companies, including Capital One, have voiced concerns about the escalating prices of AWS. Some people are even thinking about switching suppliers or creating their own AI infrastructure.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nBank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\n\nStory Continues\nA collaboration with OpenAI helps Amazon respond to that criticism. It sends a message: AWS isn't simply selling computing power; it's constructing the infrastructure for AI on a large scale and at a lower cost.\nWhat if OpenAI trains GPT-5 on Trainium chips instead of Nvidia processors? That's a big gain for believability.\n\nIt's also a way to protect investments. Anthropic has already gotten money from Amazon. It might now be supporting both of the top independent AI laboratories, which would guarantee its victory.\nRelated: Intel CEO deals spark controversy, debate\nMore broadly, the deal:\nStrengthens Amazon’s grip on multi-billion dollar AI workloads.\nUndermines \"single-cloud\" dependence criticism.\nAdds pressure on neo-cloud startups and rivals like Oracle.\nCould slow defections from AWS by enterprise clients concerned about cost.\nA trillion-dollar AI IPO? Amazon wants in The other side? OpenAI's plan to go public.\nOpenAI may now accept money from people who don't work for Microsoft after a big restructuring in 2025.\nAmazon entering the cap table gives it more weight, which probably raises OpenAI's value toward the projected $1 trillion IPO goal in 2026 or 2027.\nAmazon isn't only about using the cloud. It's a gamble that OpenAI will be a key player in the next tech era. And if OpenAI leverages Amazon's infrastructure to get there, that's even better.\n\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nThe acquisition does, however, pose certain dangers. Some experts are concerned about how \"circular\" these investments are: Big Tech gives money to startups, which then spend that money on Big Tech's platforms. That kind of thing has happened before in tech bubbles.\nBut Amazon's effort is plainly different in one way. It's not simply buying enthusiasm; it wants to sell the infrastructure that makes it work.\nHere’s why the deal could reshape the landscape:\nAmazon would join Microsoft as a top-tier OpenAI partner.\nOpenAI gains multi-cloud flexibility (Azure, AWS, Oracle).\nTrainium adoption could reduce Nvidia dependence.\nOpenAI gets a financial runway to delay IPO if needed.\nAmazon may lock in rights to exclusive OpenAI features.\nRelated: Box office is booming in 2025 but Netflix’s $82.7 billion surprise raises alarms\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Want to Invest in Quantum Computing? 3 Stocks That Are Great Buys Right Now\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:52 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nINTC\n\nIBM\n\nKey Points Google parent Alphabet is making waves with its new quantum computing processor.\nIntel's long-term comeback partially hinges on quantum computing.\nIBM's strength in supercomputing could help make it a leader in the quantum field.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nInvestors may struggle with what to make of quantum computing stocks . The technology increases the amount of computing power exponentially. Unfortunately, quantum computing is a highly error-prone technology, and in many respects, it is a solution without a problem.\n\nBoth tech giants and start-ups have undertaken efforts in this arena. Still, almost every start-up is a speculative, money-losing company with a nosebleed valuation. Knowing that, investors are probably wise to look at established companies building quantum computing segments.\nThese three companies below fit the bill. Let's have a closer look at them.\nAlphabet Admittedly, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has fostered a comeback recently based on artificial intelligence (AI). Thus, its investors seem focused on its latest Google Gemini update or the AI powering its autonomous vehicle segment, Waymo.\nHowever, investors should also not ignore its advancements in quantum computing. The company has built large-scale quantum computers focused on addressing error correction, a challenge that has plagued the quantum industry.\n\nTo that end, it incorporated what it calls a \"breakthrough algorithm\" on its Willow quantum processor that delivers quantum advantage. This applies the technology to problems in molecular science, materials science, and other areas.\nMoreover, investors can expect that quantum computing will play a more significant role in driving this company's revenue in the coming years. Alphabet holds $98 billion in liquidity and generated almost $74 billion in free cash flow over the last year. Hence, unlike the start-ups, investors know the Google parent holds the resources to compete in this field.\nFurthermore, even with Alphabet stock up by more than 60% over the last 12 months, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30 is close to the S&P 500 average earnings multiple of 31, meaning investors can buy this stock at a reasonable price.\n\nIntel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is another tech giant that investors have written off, as its chip industry competitors beat it on innovation, leaving investors with questions as to whether it could stay relevant in today's tech market. Nonetheless, current CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reorienting Intel with an engineering-first culture, and one area of focus is quantum computing.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company recently introduced its Tunnel Falls quantum chip, which it has made available for research. Also, its Horse Ridge II cryogenic control chip has helped it overcome scalability issues, one challenge quantum computing technology faces.\nAlso, despite its struggles in recent years, Intel has attracted investor interest, including from the Trump administration, which invested in the company earlier this year. Additionally, its free cash flow turned positive in the third quarter of 2025, coming in at $896 million. That helps give Intel the financial stability it needs to advance its technology.\n\nIndeed, its recent return to profitability makes its P/E ratio a poor measure of its valuation. Still, its stock is up by more than 80% over the last year.\nFurthermore, a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3 is below the S&P 500's 3.4 average and allows investors to buy into Intel's recovery at a reasonable price. As Intel's turnaround continues, now might be a good time to buy before more investors become aware of Intel's growing quantum capabilities.\nIBM In recent years, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has become better known for its cloud computing capabilities. However, it has long led the way in supercomputing, and to that end, it developed its first quantum computer in 2019.\nThe advancements have continued since that time, and it has just released its IBM Quantum Nighthawk, a 120-qubit computer that can run circuits with more complexity while keeping a lid on error rates. Looking forward, its quantum advantage promises improvements over classical-only problem-solving methods, and by 2029, it plans to deliver a \"fault-tolerant\" computer that incorporates technology to more efficiently correct errors.\n\nInvestors should expect such advancements to continue amid the $14 billion in free cash flow it forecasts for 2025. About $6.3 billion of that will cover its dividend, which rises annually and returns 2.2% yearly. That frees the rest of its free cash flow to invest back into its business.\nAdditionally, the stock is up more than 30% over the last year amid its growing relevance in today's tech world. Also, as the pace of growth rises, its 37 P/E ratio has become more palatable, positioning IBM for continued gains, which are likely to be increasingly driven by quantum computing in the coming years.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "The 3 Deep Learning Stocks That Could Be Worth 50% More by 2027\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:10 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Microsoft owns 27% of OpenAI, with massive Azure cloud contracts in the pipeline.\nAlphabet has come back to be a recognized leader in generative AI, with a big lead in autonomous vehicles.\nIntel has begun its turnaround, which should only accelerate in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n2025 is nearly over, and despite the strong year, many investors are biting their fingernails over the prospects for 2026. Will the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continue despite talks of a bubble and debt investors recently balking at funding large-scale data centers? Whom will President Donald Trump pick as the new Federal Reserve chair, and will the new nominee be independent?\n\nShort-term concerns always dominate headlines and investors' mindsets in the moment, but real long-term outperformance comes from taking a broader mindset and looking at the big picture.\nAssuming the AI buildout continues apace and AI usage increases over the next several years -- and there's no evidence AI adoption is slowing at all -- these three artificial intelligence stocks still look like they have upside. In fact, there's a case for 50% upside for each in 2026.\n1. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up a solid 15% year to date in 2025 but has pulled back in recent months. Investors have grown nervous over OpenAI's technical moat and ability to fund massive spending commitments. That's important for Microsoft, which is both a 27% owner of OpenAI and a cloud provider for $250 billion of OpenAI cloud computing commitments -- a result of the 2025 negotiations by which OpenAI converted into a for-profit company.\n\nThat ownership and cloud pipeline would be highly bullish for Microsoft, but doubt has crept in regarding OpenAI's lead in generative AI in recent months. Rival Anthropic has shown significant enterprise growth, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) released its impressive Gemini 3 model in November.\nStill, the fear may be misplaced. It doesn't seem likely that the AI revolution would be dominated by a single model builder, but rather by a cohort of winners in an oligopoly. That's how both the semiconductor and cloud computing sectors have evolved. The AI large language model (LLM) market will likely follow a similar path.\nAfter all, Alphabet was regarded as a loser in the AI race as recently as this year, only to retake the lead. OpenAI is certainly not going away, and this week's investment in OpenAI by Amazon appears to indicate that at least some astute executives and investors still believe in the company.\n\nWeiterlesen\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley sell-side analyst Keith Weiss just upgraded Microsoft stock, giving it a $650 price target, good for 35% upside from the current price. His analysis and conversations with management indicated that Azure AI demand is stronger than initially thought and that Azure AI's gross margins can expand with scale as more revenue is generated over the next two years. Furthermore, Weiss noted that his estimates don't even contemplate the full OpenAI contract, which could lead to further upside.\n\n2026 should also see the introduction of Microsoft's next-generation AI chip, named Braga. According to reports this past summer, the chip was initially planned for 2025, but a redesign pushed back its introduction by six months. If Microsoft can develop an impressive in-house-designed chip, as Alphabet and Amazon have, that could lead to even more optimism.\n2. Alphabet Speaking of Alphabet, it would definitely be possible for both Microsoft and Alphabet to appreciate 50% in 2026. While Alphabet has had the best year of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, up 62% on the year, Alphabet also entered the year as the cheapest of the bunch. In fact, despite this year's rise, it's still the second-cheapest of the bunch .\n\nComing into the year, investors were nervous that AI chatbots could disrupt Alphabet's Search business. However, that doesn't seem to be happening. Search paid clicks grew by 2%, 4%, and 7% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively, showing a reacceleration after Alphabet introduced AI Mode into Search in May.\nWith the November release of Gemini 3, Alphabet has seemingly taken the lead for the moment in the AI race across several benchmarks. What's even better is that Gemini 3 was trained on Alphabet's homegrown Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Following the Gemini release, other major companies are now looking to buy or lease TPUs from Alphabet or its cloud unit, Google Cloud.\n\nEven Alphabet rival Meta Platforms is reportedly considering using TPUs, according to late-November press reports. And just last Friday, Reuters reported a massive cloud deal worth over $10 billion between cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and Google Cloud.\nThat all bodes very well for Google Cloud, which has been an incredibly underrated part of Alphabet's business. Google Cloud has now reached scale, with a $60 billion revenue run-rate and an almost $5 billion operating profit run-rate as of the last quarter. Growth accelerated by 34% for that business in Q3, accompanied by margin expansion.\nSo not only could the Cloud unit become a second major profit center beyond ad revenue, but 2026 could also bring exciting developments for Waymo. Waymo is now delivering over 1 million autonomous rides per month, with a significant lead over competitors in scaling. Next year could bring about more disclosure around Waymo's revenue or valuation, which could add yet another major business to Alphabet's expanding empire.\n\n3. Intel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has had an even better year than Alphabet or Microsoft, up 83.6% on the year thus far. Of course, Intel was trading at a practically distressed price heading into 2025, below its book value and without a CEO. And despite the 2025 surge, its market cap is still far, far lower than all the supposed AI winners of today.\n\nMeanwhile, 2026 is shaping up to be an exciting year. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who joined the company in March, will begin to make his presence felt more noticeably. The all-important 18A node -- the node at which Intel predicts it will either equal competitors or regain its technology leadership in the industry -- will begin to deliver product. 18A has just begun high-volume manufacturing this quarter, with the first 18A product, Panther Lake, set to enter the laptop market in January.\nSuccess on 18A in the form of better revenue and margins could yield external customer wins for future nodes 18AP and 14A. Already, technology pundits are reporting that major companies such as Apple , Nvidia, and even Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices are looking to potentially use the 14A node for their server central processing units (CPUs), according to analysts for China research firm GF Securities.\n\nIf an external customer were to commit to Intel's 14A node, which is expected to be released in 2027 or 2028, there could be confirmation of the customer win during 2026. After all, there has already been a flurry of positive reports on 14A technology and the adoption of Intel's EMIB packaging technology over the past month or so.\nIf investors come to believe that Intel has pulled even or ahead in terms of process technology, financial results improve with 18A manufacturing, and/or Intel announces a significant external 18AP or 14A customer win for its foundry, there is still considerable upside left in the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock To Buy in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Alphabet is finally getting some recognition from investors for its AI accomplishments.\nThe search-engine giant has ample opportunities to benefit from increased AI spending.\nWhile the stock has gotten a bit expensive, it looks poised to fly higher in the long-run.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has served as an unprecedented bellwether for technology stocks over the last three years. In particular, semiconductor stocks including Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Broadcom were all ushered into the trillion-dollar club thanks to the AI revolution.\nAs investment in AI infrastructure continues to unfold, I think it's likely that chip stocks will remain sound investment choices. But as 2026 approaches, I see a different tech titan taking center stage: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nLet's dig into how Alphabet has built an AI fortress poised to dominate the future. From there, I'll explore the company's valuation trends and make the case for why now is a great time to buy Alphabet stock hand over fist.\nIt's been a quiet three years for Alphabet...until now The AI revolution kicked off almost exactly three years ago when OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT quickly captured the imaginations of people all over the world with its ability to answer virtually any question instantly.\nThe dramatic rise in popularity among large language models (LLMs) caused some on Wall Street to pose the idea that traditional search tools like Google were headed for doom. Think of the business stakes at hand here: Why would advertisers continue paying a premium on platforms like Google and YouTube when everyone's attention was flocking to chatbots?\n\nWhile Alphabet's advertising business did show some signs of stalling, the company's cash cow remained somewhat resilient. For a couple of years, revenue from Google and YouTube wasn't as robust as it once was, but it also wasn't plummeting at an alarming rate.\nWhat many investors were overlooking, however, was Alphabet's other ventures. At the beginning of the AI revolution, Google Cloud was operating at an annual revenue run rate of about $29 billion. Meanwhile, this segment of Alphabet's business was unprofitable.\nFast forward to today, and Google Cloud is now on pace for more than $50 billion of annual sales while boasting positive operating income. What's even more interesting is that Google Cloud has won major deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic -- the two LLMs that were once seen as the ultimate existential threat to Google's relevancy.\n\nStory Continues\nBesides the success of its cloud division, Alphabet has also successfully launched its own LLM -- called Gemini. According to management, Gemini has over 650 million monthly active users (MAUs) while search queries are increasing threefold quarter over quarter.\nWhy 2026 could be epic for Gemini For most of the AI revolution, I think the consensus view around Alphabet was one of uncertainty. While not everyone bought into the extinction of Google narrative, it's fair to say that it took some time for Alphabet to prove its AI ambitions were bearing fruit.\nOne of the biggest catalysts the company has going into next year is an extension of Google Cloud through commercializing custom hardware. Specifically, Alphabet's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), known as tensor processing units (TPUs), have seen some early traction with Apple and Anthropic.\n\nWhile TPUs aren't going to dethrone Nvidia's GPU business anytime soon, I think Alphabet is on the cusp of unlocking a new wave of growth in the cloud infrastructure market that's currently dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\nAlphabet stock could soar to new highs next year As of this writing, Alphabet's forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio is hovering around 28 -- its highest level during the AI boom.\nNormally, I tend to stay away from momentum stocks. More times than not, by the time a company reaches a record high, it's dicey to buy the premium and expect shares to move materially higher.\nThis is a rare instance where I think the opposite is true. Alphabet's current price increase reflects two factors: An appreciation for the company's current operating performance and a bullish outlook that Alphabet will keep up its strong performance.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem -- from search, cloud computing, consumer electronics, custom hardware, and more -- is a major differentiator compared to its mega cap peers. The company has a unique flexibility stitched into its DNA -- benefiting from AI across its various assets and subsidiaries during any market cycle. These dynamics position Alphabet as a particularly durable business for the long run.\nAs investments in AI infrastructure are expected to continue rising going into next year, I expect Alphabet to benefit from these tailwinds more so than any one singular chip designer or software developer.\nWith this in mind, I think Alphabet will continue to show signs of accelerating revenue and profit margin expansion across its entire business next year -- which should lead to even more buying from shareholders. Against this backdrop, I see Alphabet as the best opportunity in the AI landscape as 2026 approaches.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

The firm told investors that consumer internet companies delivered solid returns in the year, averaging 23% across 24 covered companies compared to 19% for the NASDAQ. Wedbush expects performance to diverge in 2026, with investors taking into account factors such as the rising adoption of agentic AI, AI monetization, ongoing investment cycles, and AV disruption.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also received a rating update from Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post on December 18, who reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $335.00.\nIn a separate development, Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ: IREN ) shares\nDec. 3 : Bought $1,000 to $15,000 Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX ) shares\nDec. 3 : Bought $1,000 to $15,000 Netflix Inc shares\nDec. 1: Bought $50,000 to $100,000 Alphabet Class A shares\nThe congressman also disclosed selling stakes in SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN ), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM ), CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ: CRWV ), AT&T Inc (NYSE: T ) and Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER ).\n\nFields’ Magnificent 7 Preferences When it comes to buying up Magnificent Seven stocks, Fields has shown preference to several of the components over the 2025 year.\nThe latest purchase shows totals of:\nAlphabet Class A: $215,000 to $500,000\nAlphabet Class C : $1,000 to $15,000\nMicrosoft : $2,000 to $30,000\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nPreviously, Fields had been buying up shares of six of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks, with Tesla being the lone stock left out. But in recent disclosures, Fields has shown a preference to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Alphabet and Microsoft, but leaving out Meta Platforms and Amazon.com from purchases.\nWhile there could be more filings from Fields before the end of the year, the most recent disclosures point to a potential recent bias or preference for Alphabet stock heading into 2026. Nvidia was the top purchase in months like August and September, but the most recent months show Alphabet as a top purchase.\n\nStory Continues\nOutside of the Magnificent Seven, Fields has also been aggressively buying up Netflix stock, which comes with the company in the middle of a potential blockbuster acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery.\nWith Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi set to leave Congress in 2027, investors may have to find new members of Congress with proven track records of large purchases and strong returns to follow. Fields could fit that mold.\n\nRead Next:\nBuffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "Here's your big free reminder on AI stocks for 2026\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nHUT\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nCRWV\n\nThis is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nMy gym trainer hit me with a dose of tough love this week.\nWe are in the middle of a program called \"12 Days of Suffering\" — honestly some of the most grueling workouts I've ever done in my life. I can barely stand for my live show Opening Bid each day.\n\nOn Wednesday, I almost passed out on a rowing machine. My trainer told me, while I was on the ground, \"No one is coming to save you. Get your ass up.\"\nIt was much-appreciated motivation for the self-motivated me.\nAnd I want to give you a similar shot of inspiration as we get ready to enter 2026: No one is coming to save your portfolio from complacency on AI stocks.\nHow's that Oracle ( ORCL ) you bought in September working out? Still riding the once-buzzy CoreWeave ( CRWV )? I imagine in both cases, things are not looking too rosy. Why? Because you did no homework on these companies — and simply bought them because they were AI-related and in the news.\nDo better!!\n\nThe reality is you have to think beyond the obvious AI stocks in 2026 to drive gains. Beyond the richly valued \"Magnificent 7.\" Beyond a company like Oracle, whose billionaire CEO, Larry Ellison, is also trying to help his son buy a struggling Warner Bros. ( WBD ). You have to think deeply about where else the AI trade will appear and create value.\n\nMap this stuff out on a whiteboard if you have to!\nAI is having a profound impact inside companies. As a result, it will drive a good bit of positive earnings surprises in many of the other 493 companies housed in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nHere are two examples of the work you need to be doing on AI investing.\nThe appetite to own AI plays is broadening to more under-the-radar names, including companies that are using the technology aggressively in the industrial sector. One of those companies is logistics giant C.H. Robinson ( CHRW ), led by one of the best CEOs you probably never heard of: David Bozeman .\nBozeman has led the 120-year-old logistics player for more than two years, after stints in transportation operations at Amazon ( AMZN ), Harley-Davidson ( HOG ), and Caterpillar ( CAT ).\n\nSince Bozeman's arrival, C.H. Robinson has leaned hard into AI to improve operating profits. Its stock price is up 55% in 2025. FYI, Meta's ( META ) stock is only up 11% this year! That's despite Bozeman telling me in a new episode of my Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (video above) that the economy isn't growing too quickly and the freight recession continues.\n\nLa historia continúa",

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "1 Quantum Computing Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in December\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet has made several major breakthroughs in quantum computing.\nThe company can invest heavily in that nascent technology if it chooses.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nThe market is currently pivoting toward a risk-off approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and stocks in adjacent tech areas such as quantum computing. As a result, many quantum computing pure plays have sold off. However, that hasn't affected my top quantum computing stock pick for December: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nWhile the tech giant doesn't have the upside potential of the smaller quantum computing players, it is far steadier. Furthermore, it has resources that its competitors can only dream of.\nAlphabet has proven its quantum computing prowess The smaller quantum computing companies are all-in on the technology, and if they don't succeed in producing systems that attract a significant customer base, they're likely to go to $0. Many of them will fail.\nAlphabet, by contrast, doesn't need its quantum computing endeavors to succeed. It's developing the technology for in-house use and to rent access to through Google Cloud. But Alphabet is already spending tens of billions of dollars annually on hardware for its cloud and AI infrastructure. Anything it can do to reduce its input costs for future computing resources is a smart move.\n\nIt has already done this in the AI accelerator segment, developing a family of application-specific integrated chips it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPU) in conjunction with Broadcom . This has given Alphabet some experience in developing custom computing hardware.\nAlphabet's quantum computing chip, Willow, has already made waves in the industry. In October, it announced that a Willow chip ran an algorithm that, for the first time ever, demonstrated a verifiable quantum advantage. Its quantum computer ran that algorithm 13,000 times faster than the world's fastest supercomputer could have.\nThis was a huge step toward commercial viability for Alphabet's quantum computing hardware, and investors shouldn't be surprised if the company announces further milestone achievements in 2026. Yet unlike its smaller quantum computing competitors, Alphabet doesn't need to trumpet every little breakthrough because it is self-funding its research. The pre-earnings start-ups, by contrast, need publicity to help them attract money from research partners and the public markets to stay alive.\nBecause it has no need to please researchers or impress shareholders with its quantum computing progress in particular, Alphabet is free to pursue its own path with the technology. That's a huge advantage.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet has resources its competitors can only dream of Another reason why Alphabet is my top quantum computing stock now is that its business already produces enormous quantities of cash that it can plow into whatever growth avenues it chooses. Currently, a lot of that money is being spent to construct data centers for AI computing, but if quantum computing turns out to be all that it has been hyped up to be, Alphabet could easily devote a large chunk of its cash flow toward advancing its position in that technology.\n\nThe two metrics that investors should pay attention to on that front are operating cash flow and free cash flow. Operating cash flow is the total amount that the business generates from operations, while free cash flow measures what's left after it covers obligations such as interest expenses and taxes, and also capital expenditures. While a vast amount of Alphabet's cash flows are going toward its data center buildouts, it still has plenty available to devote to other ambitions such as quantum computing.\nFor Alphabet, it wouldn't be a stretch to throw $10 billion at its quantum computing unit, but it's a sum that the pure plays could only dream of. Because of its superior resources and the achievements it has already made in the space, I think it will be a force to be reckoned with by the time useful quantum computing comes to market. It also isn't a boom-or-bust investment, making it a far safer stock to own than its smaller quantum computing competitors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

But when we're done patting ourselves on the back for a job well done with Nvidia , Alphabet , and Palantir Technologies , it's time to look for the next big thing.\n\nThat's because it's easier to have dramatic gains when you're starting with a smaller market capitalization . Palantir had a market cap of less than $50 billion when I first bought the stock in 2022, and its current $431 billion market cap now makes it one of the largest companies in the world.\nIts stock has gained 2,210% since July 2022. And if it were to gain another 2,210% in the next three years, it would have a market cap of $10 trillion -- more than twice as large as the current market leader, Nvidia.\nObviously, that's not happening. To find an artificial intelligence (AI) stock with the potential for a Palantir-size gain over the next three years, we need to examine one that still has significant growth ahead. One that I'm considering right now is a stock I've been skeptical about in the past: SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) .\nWhat is SoundHound AI? SoundHound operates an AI platform that allows users to have conversations to use voice-enabled services and apps. Voice-enabled products have been around for a long time -- for example, automated customer-service phone numbers and voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa. However, the early iterations of this technology were clunky enough to create significant user frustration.\n\nSoundHound, which went public in 2021, primarily worked in the automotive and restaurant industries before taking a significant step forward in 2024 with its $80 million acquisition of Amelia AI, an AI agent that is customizable for internal use or public-facing applications.\nThe acquisition pushed SoundHound's corporate client base to more than 200 customers. However, the company still hasn't been able to turn a profit, and investors may have signaled this year that they're becoming concerned about the stock: Shares are down more than 40% this year.\nPart of the problem may be the company's third-quarter earnings report, which showed a sharp net loss of $109.3 million, versus a loss of $21.7 million a year ago. The loss wiped out its impressive $42 million in revenue, which was up 68% from a year ago.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, $66 million of the loss was due to a noncash, nonoperating accounting charge related to previous acquisitions. The adjusted net loss was $13 million, which was an improvement from a year ago. And most importantly, the business ended the quarter with zero debt and cash on hand of $269 million.\n\nIn addition, SoundHound is increasing its client base, including by the following:\nA deal to integrate SoundHound Chat AI into \"double-digit millions of AI-enabled smart devices\" developed by an unnamed Chinese company.\nAn agreement with an Italian commercial-vehicle company to install voice AI in its fleet.\nExpansions of the scope of contracts with three top financial services institutions.\nAn agreement with a U.S. regional hospital system to deploy the Amelia platform.\nA deal to supply a national full-service restaurant chain with voice-ordering technology.\nAn agreement with a telecommunications provider that offers TV and internet in 20 U.S. states.\nWhat should you expect from the stock? Analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance are unanimous in their prediction that SoundHound stock will move higher in the next year. The mean price target of $17.19 is 53% higher than the current stock price; the low price target of $15 is 33% higher.\nSoundHound may not replicate Palantir's rapid growth, but I see many similarities between the two companies. Three years ago, in the second quarter of 2022, Palantir was losing money, too -- it posted a net loss in the quarter of $179.3 million as it was building out its platforms.\n\nManagement has expanded SoundHound's business model to include a variety of functions, including customer service, sales, marketing, operations, and IT service management. The company has enabled more than 10 billion personalized automated voice conversations annually.\nAs companies strive to become more efficient and increasingly reliant on AI solutions to streamline their products while still personalizing customer interactions, SoundHound AI's growth is expected to continue. Clearly, I've misjudged this company with my aforementioned skepticism. Because when its quarterly losses start turning into gains, I think the stock will skyrocket in the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in SoundHound AI right now?

Its analysis shows retailers would need “~50% of agentic transactions to be incremental for EBIT breakeven (at a 5% fee),” which Morgan Stanley calls “a tall order.”\nThrough this lens, Amazon, Walmart, Target and eBay face higher margin risk from third-party agentic partnerships, while Chewy and Wayfair may have more opportunity, Morgan Stanley wrote.\nIn digital advertising, Morgan Stanley expects “leading performance-based reach platforms” to become more valuable, naming Meta, YouTube and AppLovin as potential winners as agentic shopping changes traffic patterns and monetization models.\nRelated articles\nMorgan Stanley maps the retail winners and losers from agentic shoppers\nLoading Up HEAVY on These 3 Stocks by End of 2025 (+ 1 New ETF)\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What Is the Best Quantum Computing Stock Billionaire Investors Are Buying Right Now?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nGOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points The most popular quantum computing stocks include pure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum.\nSeveral \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are also exploring the benefits of quantum artificial intelligence (AI).\nInstitutional investors poured into Alphabet stock during the third quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWhen it comes to investing in quantum computing stocks, it's natural for pure plays like IonQ , Rigetti Computing , or D-Wave Quantum to surface first in the conversation. What investors may not fully realize, however, is that a number of megacap tech companies are also exploring the advantages of quantum artificial intelligence (AI).\nFor instance, cloud hyperscalers Microsoft and Amazon have each designed their own quantum chips. Meanwhile, Nvidia offers a suite of software platforms that can be used in hybrid environments featuring classical and quantum computing.\nWhen it comes to the best quantum computing stock, though, billionaire investors seem to have a clear winner. According to 13F filings from the third quarter, a number of high-caliber institutional investors have been pouring into Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\n\nStanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office initiated a position in Alphabet, buying 102,200 shares.\nIsrael Englander's fund, Millennium Management, increased its position in the company by 66%, adding 1.4 million shares in the third quarter.\nKen Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, bought 1.2 million shares during the third quarter, increasing his stake by 200%.\nPhilippe Laffont's Coatue Management increased its stake in Alphabet by 259%, purchasing 5.2 million shares.\nMost notably, Warren Buffett added the company to Berkshire Hathaway 's portfolio during the third quarter, buying 17.8 million shares worth roughly $4.3 billion.\nLet's explore how Alphabet is quietly disrupting the quantum computing landscape. From there, I'll also break down how the technology fits into the company's broader ambitions in the AI market.\nHow is Alphabet investing in quantum computing? Google Quantum AI is the laboratory responsible for leading Alphabet's quantum computing efforts.\nThe company's Willow chip focuses on building scalable, error-correcting systems that specialize in solving complex problems that today's supercomputers simply cannot process.\nIt also released Cirq, a software tool kit that allows developers to research and refine quantum algorithms.\n\nThe real reason billionaires love Alphabet Alphabet is far more than an internet business. While advertising revenue from Google and YouTube is the company's crown jewel, management has quietly integrated new AI services across its entire business.\n\nStory continues\nToday, users can leverage Alphabet's large language model (LLM), Gemini, on the Google Search homepage, as well as through the company's Android devices.\nGoogle Cloud is also one of the fastest growing and most profitable segments of Alphabet's business, proving it can compete with incumbents like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. A potentially lucrative component of Google Cloud that is yet to be fully launched is the commercialization of Alphabet's custom chips, called tensor processing units (TPUs).\n\nCompanies including Apple and Anthropic have already trained AI models using TPUs, and rumor has it that Meta Platforms is eyeing these custom chips for its next-generation of AI products.\nAlphabet has masterfully stitched AI across the broader fabric of its ecosystem -- in search, advertising, cloud computing, consumer electronics, hardware, and even autonomous driving through Waymo.\nIn technical terms, Alphabet has vertically integrated its various assets, positioning it to remain resilient during just about any economic cycle and making its revenue and profitability profile especially durable.\nWhy Alphabet stock looks like a screaming buy heading into 2026 The takeaway from the details above is that quantum computing represents yet another piece of the foundation in Alphabet's broader AI pyramid. It's not commercially available today, but I see Google Quantum as a pillar of Alphabet's next wave of AI products that can be seamlessly integrated within the company's existing architecture.\nAs the graph above illustrates, Alphabet stock has been soaring lately. As a result, the company's valuation has become quite extended. While a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29 isn't exactly cheap, I still see the stock as a compelling buy right now.\nTo me, the caliber of institutional capital flowing toward it at the moment is unrivaled. Despite the momentum, I see Alphabet's valuation as reasonable relative to the company's long-term upside.\n\nIn my view, the combination of the company's existing AI ecosystem and the upside of quantum computing make it unique in an otherwise frothy and fiercely competitive market. For these reasons, I see Alphabet as a screaming buy as 2026 approaches.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Why Alphabet Stock Could Double By 2030\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 10:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points The tech company's core ad business is a cash cow, helping fund investments into growth opportunities.\nAlphabet's cloud computing business is seeing impressive momentum.\nThere's a clear path to a potential doubling of Alphabet's stock price by 2030.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nNot only is Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) core business already throwing off tons of cash, but it has a second growth engine that is quickly morphing into a separate material cash machine for the company. When combining this fast-growing cloud computing business with Alphabet's core advertising business (powered by Google Search and YouTube), the technology giant has a lot going for it. Indeed, there may even be a path to the stock doubling in five years -- and that's on top of a huge move higher in 2025.\n\nTo understand why a doubling of Alphabet's stock price by 2030 is possible, let's take a look at the company's underlying business momentum -- and what would need to go right in the coming years for the stock to get to levels above $600.\nWhy the stock has soared Showing Alphabet's impressive momentum, its growth has been accelerating recently. Its revenue grew revenue 14% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, and then 16% in Q3.\n\nBut the tech company 's bottom-line momentum is even more impressive. Alphabet's third-quarter net income hit $35.0 billion, up from $326.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. And earnings per share rose more than 35% year over year.\n\nOf course, aggressive share repurchases have played a key role in the company's outsize earnings-per-share growth relative to its top-line growth. And investors are likely pleased with the company's still-young but growing dividend; in Q1, Alphabet's board approved a 5% dividend increase and a new $70 billion repurchase authorization.\n\nThis business momentum, even as the company returns huge sums of capital to shareholders, helps explain the stock's significant move higher this year. Shares have gained an extraordinary 62% year to date.\nWhy the stock can keep climbing Alphabet's main catalyst to watch over the next five years, in addition to an already strong core advertising business, is its cloud computing business, Google Cloud. The segment's revenue rose 34% year over year in Q3, hitting $15.2 billion (about 15% of the quarter's total revenue).\nEven more, the segment is proving to be quite lucrative. Google Cloud operating income in Q3 was $3.6 billion, up about 85% year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nIf this segment grows as a percent of overall revenue and continues to become more profitable as it scales, it could provide a substantial boost to the company's overall profits in the coming years.\nBut this buildout will cost a lot of money. Management recently raised its 2025 capital expenditures outlook, saying that it now expects to spend between $91 billion $93 billion in capital expenditures in 2025. Spending like this will likely pressure free cash flow in the near term, making it critical that Alphabet's big investments eventually pay off.\n\nThe math to a double With this background on the company's momentum in mind, here's the simple math behind a potential double for the stock.\nIf Alphabet trades at about a price-to-earnings ratio of about 25 in 2030 and the stock price is trading at approximately $614 (compared to its current price of about $307), annualized earnings per share would need to be near $24.60.\n\nThat implies earnings per share a bit more than doubling from where it sits today on a trailing basis (Alphabet's trailing-12-month earnings per share currently stands at $10.13), and it works out to something like high-teens annual growth over five years.\nTo achieve this, revenue needs to keep growing at a rate similar to what it has been, and expenses need to rise more slowly than sales. Further, repurchases need to keep chipping away at the share count.\nGiven how much AI has been catalyzing Alphabet's business recently, these assumptions seem plausible.\n\nOf course, there are some critical risks. AI could reshape search monetization faster than Alphabet can adapt. Additionally, regulators can force changes that reduce pricing power in ads or make distribution more expensive. Finally, the capital spending cycle for the company to capture its growth opportunities in AI looks like it's going to be intense.\n\nIn short, it's possible -- and arguably even likely -- that Alphabet's stock doubles by the end of 2030. However, investors will need to continually assess the ever-changing risks, particularly given the capital-intensive nature of the company's cloud computing business. If these big investments pay off in even faster revenue growth and margin expansion over time, the stock could easily double. But if strong growth from these investments is never realized, investors may need to reassess the bull case.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "OpenAI vs. Apple? Sam Altman is setting his sights on winning what could be an even higher-stakes AI battle\n\nAlyson Shontell\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAll eyes are on the Big Tech LLM race and, at least in the eyes of investors , it seems like Google (owned by Alphabet , No. 7) could run away with the win.\nGoogle’s Gemini has been steadily stealing buzz and AI traffic share over the last few months from OpenAI. And if there was any moat to be had in LLMs, it would seem like it would belong to the company with the biggest treasure chest of personal data on users. That almost indisputably would be Google, thanks to Android, YouTube , Search history, Maps, and Gmail. On top of that, the company has one of the top AI minds, Demis Hassabis, and Google cofounder Sergey Brin leading its troops toward dominance.\n\nPerhaps that’s why Sam Altman is setting his sights on winning what could be an even higher-stakes AI battle: creating the future mass AI consumer device. Altman feels that in the long term, his greatest foe will be Apple (No. 4), not Google, Meta (No. 22), or Amazon (No. 2). He recruited iPhone designer Jony Ive to OpenAI this May, and Ive has said the company’s secret device could be ready in the next two years.\nWhat will that device be like? If you ask Altman, he describes limitations with the mobile phone. First of all, it can be turned off. It also can’t scan the room around you and give you real-time context and know exactly when to deliver relevant information to you. He sounds more bullish about audio than visual as the primary means of communication. And he sees no reason why a device and an operating system should be sold separately, like Google and Android—a future device should come with the trademark LLM baked in, like iOS in an iPhone.\n\nThanks largely to that iPhone, Apple is generating tens of billions of dollars a year in cash flow that it can plow into new devices and armies of engineers to design them—two areas where OpenAI lags far behind. Then again, Apple seems ripe to be disrupted: As Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said on Joe Rogan’s podcast earlier this year, “They haven’t invented anything great in a while. It’s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.”\nBut for now, OpenAI and its team are all about perfecting ChatGPT.

      "Content": "3 Reasons to Buy Alphabet Stock in 2026 (And 1 to Sell)\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Alphabet's core businesses are doing quite well despite investor concerns.\nThe tech giant may be opening up a new business unit with great potential.\nHowever, the stock isn't as cheap as it once was, trading now at a premium.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the top-performing stocks in the whole market in 2025. Its stock has risen over 60%, placing it in the top 30 performers of the S&P 500 in 2025. While the top 30 may not be as impressive as the top 10, investors must realize that Alphabet's size makes this feat all the more impressive.\n\nAlphabet experienced several tailwinds in 2025 that brought its stock price to far below average to in line with its peers. This growth was aided by a positive ruling in its monopoly court case and Alphabet emerging as a leader in the generative AI realm. Those catalysts are gone for 2026, and investors need new reasons for why Alphabet's stock could soar next year.\nI've got three reasons why it will be a successful investment, and one reason it may be time to move on. But is that one reason to sell enough to outweigh the three reasons to buy? Let's find out.\n1. Alphabet's core business is excelling Alphabet has a ton of business units under its umbrella , but none is more important than its core business: Google Search.\nEarlier this year, investors were worried that Google Search may be going away as generative AI was in a position to replace it. However, that hasn't panned out, largely thanks to the integration of AI search overviews, which provide a hybrid generative AI and traditional search experience. This has allowed Google to maintain its market position and thrive in a booming ad market.\n\nIn Q3, Google Search revenue rose 15% year over year, not bad for a mature business unit that's expected to grow in the high single digits to the low double digits. When Alphabet's base business thrives, so does the rest of the company. If Google Search can keep delivering strong results throughout 2026, Alphabet stock will be a great one to own.\n2. Google Cloud is thriving in the AI buildout Another area of its business that's doing quite well is its cloud computing wing, Google Cloud. Cloud computing is thriving for two reasons.\nFirst, traditional workloads are migrating to the cloud because it's much easier than maintaining expensive equipment and computing hardware on-site. Second, artificial intelligence workloads are rapidly coming online, and most companies don't have the resources to build their own giant data center, so they rent computing capacity from a provider like Google Cloud.\n\nStory Continues\nIn Q3, Google Cloud's revenue rose 34% year over year. That's one of Alphabet's fastest-growing segments, and investors shouldn't be surprised to see this growth rate continue throughout 2026.\n3. Alphabet may have a new business unit launching Part of the reason Alphabet's cloud computing business has been so successful is its custom AI chips, Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). TPUs are an alternative to graphics processing units (GPUs) and are suited for specific workloads more than GPUs. This allows them to deliver better performance at a lower cost when running specific workloads, making them a popular option.\n\nCurrently, clients can only gain access to them by renting them through Google Cloud. But that could be changing. Reportedly, Alphabet is in talks with Meta Platforms to sell TPUs outright, which could be a brand-new business unit starting up. That's a revenue stream that investors haven't accounted for, making Alphabet an intriguing stock for 2026.\nAlphabet's stock isn't as cheap as it once was After its strong run in 2025, Alphabet's stock is no longer cheap. It now trades for nearly 30 times forward earnings, which isn't a historically cheap price tag for any stock.\nThis may hamper Alphabet's long-term returns, but only if the market deems the stock too expensive. Many of Alphabet's big tech peers have traded around this valuation level for an extended time period, so it isn't unrealistic to assume that Alphabet can maintain this premium.\nIf it can, Alphabet will be a top stock to own for 2025. If it can't, it could be a rough year.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $506,935 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,067,514 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 958 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 192% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/15 - 12/19\n\nMarketBeat Staff\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nUPWK\n\nNOW\n\nPFE\n\nXLF\n\nThe markets were moving higher to end the week, but will it be enough to bring about the hoped-for Santa Claus rally? The belated November inflation reading helped, as did a jobs number that supported future rate cuts. Money continues to move into the market even as there are signs of sector rotation.\n\nHowever, the macro story remains mixed. Investors got hit with weak November housing data to end the week, which could weigh down overall sentiment.\nNext week will be a shortened trading week due to the Christmas holiday. Markets will be closed that day and close at 1:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve.\n&rarr; 3 Cheap Dividend Stocks That Can Beat Inflation and Pay You to Wait\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\nThomas Hughes reminded investors that concerns about an AI bubble may persist. However, the results from a company like Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) tell a more bullish story. The company delivered exceptional results backed by strong demand. Technical signals point to as much as 60% upside for MU stock.\n&rarr; Forget the Chips: 4 Industrial Plays for the AI Rebound\n\nA major story from this week was the Trump administration&rsquo;s reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule III drug. Earlier in the week, Hughes explained how the cannabis industry would benefit, which stocks stand to benefit, but also why upside may be limited until institutional dollars flow into the sector.\nHughes also recapped why MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ: MDB) has been a strong performer in 2025. As Hughes noted, the company was recognized as an essential component of AI infrastructure in 2025. Bullish sentiment from analysts and institutions suggests MDB stock has room to run.\n&rarr; Nike Beats on Earnings But Struggles in China and Faces Tariffs\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nAppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is one of the best-performing and most highly shorted stocks of 2025. Sam Quirke explained this contradiction and provided support for a bull case, which could lead to a short squeeze.\n\nQuirke also looked at the ongoing drop in Nutanix Inc. (NASDAQ: NTNX), which continues after the company&rsquo;s earnings report. But Quirke explained why the report may not have been as bad as it seemed, which means NTNX stock may set up as a comeback trade.\nAfter a strong run of more than 120% since April, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock appears to be extended. However, Quirke provided investors with two reasons to believe TSLA stock may still be a bargain.\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nIf analysts are correct, inflation will make a comeback in 2026. That&rsquo;s why investors may look at dividend stocks that can outpace the rate of inflation. This week, Chris Markoch pointed investors to three high-yield dividend stocks that are less than $20 per share.\n\nStory continues\nSticking with the inflation theme, Markoch noted that the long end of the yield curve remains stubbornly high despite the recent interest rate cuts. That could make these three finance stocks an attractive alternative to rising 10-year Treasury rates.\nBeef prices continue to be higher, and analysts believe it will be more of the same in 2026. It will take years to unwind the root problem at the core of the supply shortage. In the meantime, Markoch highlighted three steakhouse stocks that are managing the rising costs in different ways.\n\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nOne of the most exciting headlines this week came from SpaceX, which hinted at an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026. This week, Ryan Hasson explained why Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) would be a beneficiary of a SpaceX IPO.\nThere are clear signs of sector rotation in the market. Finance stocks are seeing some of the biggest inflows of capital. Hasson highlighted the breakout in the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLF) and why three of its largest components show bullish technical setups near breakout levels.\nIndustrial stocks continue to be among the top performers in 2025. Hasson highlighted three of the best industrial stock options for investors who are looking to capitalize on this growth heading into 2026.\n\nArticles by Leo Miller\nThe battle over who will buy Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) took a surprise turn when Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ: PSKY) entered the ring with an all-cash $30 per share counter bid to that made by Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX). This week, Leo Miller provided a breakdown of both bids and what investors should watch for.\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) stock is recovering from a sharp sell-off after the closure of its Grasburg mine. Miller explained the stock&rsquo;s recent rally and why the surge in copper prices, fueled by long-term tailwinds, is likely to keep FCX stock surging.\nThe flight from technology stocks has sent some stocks dropping sharply from their 52-week highs. Miller highlighted three tech stocks down 60% or more and explained why one of those stocks offers the best chance at a recovery.\n\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nArtificial intelligence continues to spur interest in robotics stocks. Nathan Reiff explained the tailwinds that will push the sector higher and three under-the-radar robotics stocks that may not be obscure names for much longer.\nCompanies with a strong cash flow are frequently able to reward investors with share buybacks and dividends. This week, Reiff looked at three of the best cash flow stocks that should be on the radar for investors who want income to go along with future stock price growth.\nIt's the time of year when many people think about New Year&rsquo;s resolutions. For investors, that could mean looking at beaten-down stocks that are ready to reverse. That&rsquo;s what Reiff focused on in three stocks that analysts believe could see brighter days ahead in 2026.\n\nArticles by Dan Schmidt\nIt may feel like the return of the meme stocks as Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ: UPWK) has been one of the strongest performers in 2025. Dan Schmidt analyzed the surge in UPWK stock and gave investors three reasons to be bullish and two reasons to be bearish heading into the new year.\nArticles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\nInvestors are frequently caught off guard when a stock gets separated from its story. That seemed to be the case with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) that is down sharply after its November revenue report. But Jeffrey Neal Johnson explained why the price action is largely due to high-speed algorithmic trading, which could set up an opportunity for patient investors.\nA similar story is emerging with SuperMicro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI). The stock dropped over concerns about waning demand. However, Johnson pointed out that this looks to be a case of a stock falling in sympathy with the sector, and why SMCI stock still looks like a solid buying opportunity.\n\nAnother stock that has dropped sharply on recent news is ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE: NOW). Analysts are choking on the company&rsquo;s $7 billion acquisition of Armis. Johnson explains why the deal is a sign of strength more than weakness and is creating a rare buying opportunity in an elite software name.\nArticles by Jordan Chussler\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) stock has struggled to find a catalyst after its vaccine-fueled surge in 2020 and 2021. Jordan Chussler outlined the company&rsquo;s billion-dollar investment to push into a crowded GLP-1 weight loss market. There&rsquo;s room for more than one company to succeed, and Chussler explained why PFE stock may be worth waiting for.\nIt's ironic that Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), which was the poster child of the excesses of the dot-com era, is in the middle of a long-term recovery fueled by AI. That irony wasn&rsquo;t lost on Chussler, who explained how the company has reinvented and repositioned itself for a new generation of investors.\nChussler also highlighted two of the tech sector&rsquo;s strongest performers in 2025, but pointed out why some analysts believe investors may want to mute their expectations for each company in 2026.\nThe article \" MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/15 - 12/19 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is among the 14 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Now . According to a Reuters report on Wednesday, Google is working with Meta to make its AI chips better suited to running PyTorch, in a bid to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\nGoogle\nThe initiative, called TorchTPU, aims to position Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) as an alternative to the chipmaker’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) by ensuring compatibility with clients who have built their AI infrastructure on PyTorch. The Meta-built open source project has become one of the most widely used tools for developers.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had for years reserved a major chunk of the TPUs for internal use. However, the tech giant had been discussing with Meta over the possibility of the latter using more TPUs, said the report.\nIn other news, on December 16, Bloomberg reported that self-driving car company Waymo was in talks to generate $15 billion in capital. It plans on raising the additional funds from external investors and its parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which could help value the business at around $110 billion.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns several notable platforms such as Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, and YouTube. The company is also known for pioneering work and research in cloud computing, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "What’s next for EVs after a year of unraveling\n\nHamza Shaban · Senior Reporter\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: F\n\nRIVN\n\nGM\n\nTOYOF\n\nGOOG\n\nThis is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nOne major thing changed the game for the American EV market this year: the elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit .\n\nIn an instant, EVs became much more expensive, and a key incentive for consumers and automakers to accelerate the EV transition vanished.\nIn the place of an electrified future, pushed further away, a more incremental, hybrid present is taking shape.\nEven before the EV policy shift, consumer demand had waned. Concerns lingered over the turn away from gas-powered cars. Higher costs were a factor , but so was unresolved anxiety over a perceived scarcity of charging stations and battery range. And a strain of American machismo — think of the most over-the-top Super Bowl ad aesthetic — continues to reject the technology as something prissy and foreign.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nAutomakers have struggled with the EV transition , and ambitious, revamped lineups have been curtailed.\nThe latest sign came earlier this month , when Ford announced it would abandon plans for several EV models and instead pivot to hybrid and extended-range vehicles. Ford said it would take $19.5 billion in charges related to the EV revamp.\n\nThe European Union is also expected to advance a measure to delay its 2035 ban on sales of internal combustion cars, ceding to national governments and automakers who have pushed for more flexibility .\nThat automakers have pulled back on their EV ambitions marks a major detour for the industry.\nBut the rough going offers clues of what 2026 and the next phase of the EV roadmap will look like: A focus on hybrids, lower cost models, and pressure from international markets will help shape the market.\nFord, for instance, is ending production of its Lightning, the EV variant of the F-150 pickup truck. Taking its place will be a compromise, an extended-range version that uses a gas engine as a generator.\nCrucially, the carmaker is sticking with plans to release a low-cost EV pickup by 2027. That's a sign that carmakers believe affordability and product fit can still make EVs work... just not yet.\nToyota, which was until recently seen as late to the EV space, has embraced the hybrid lineup (where it was first mover with the Prius) as a kind of stepping stone, positioning itself within the sweet spot of consumer preference — eager for better gas mileage, but not quite ready for an EV.\nPolicy changes and competition from low-cost Chinese models do complicate things for the US market. What is considered a broad retreat from pure EVs in America could expose automakers here to the eventual adoption of Chinese and European EVs — which will have the advantage of years of development and consumer feedback.\n\nStory Continues\nIn some ways, the market energy that was once buzzing around EVs has migrated to another transportation disruptor: robotaxis.\nElon Musk's Tesla ( TSLA ) is slated to begin production of its autonomous Cybercab next year, in what its most bullish backers say could add another trillion dollars to its market cap.\n\nAlphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Waymo, seeking to raise money at a valuation of at least $100 billion , has thousands of commercial robotaxis operating in the US. And Uber, through more than a dozen partnerships , has plans to provide robotaxis in at least 10 markets by the end of next year.\nThis isn't exactly the all-electric future that its most bullish proponents had envisioned. But in 2026, a hybrid approach is the recalibration the industry is banking on.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

      "Content": "3 of the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:58 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSM\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points The stocks listed here all have market caps of more than $1 trillion.\nThey are among the leading companies in tech, but their valuations still aren't terribly high with respect to earnings.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAre you worried that you've missed out on the opportunity to generate a great return from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks? There are still plenty of good and reasonably priced AI stocks you can add to your portfolio today. And many of them are already large, safe, and established players in tech.\nHeading into 2026, three AI stocks that I think possess the most upside are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) . Here's why it's not too late to invest in these three tech giants.\nAlphabet It may come as a surprise to some that Alphabet is on this list. It is, after all, already one of the most valuable companies in the world. Its market cap of $3.7 trillion puts it not all that far behind the world's most valuable company, Nvidia , which is worth $4.3 trillion. Once a company gets that valuable, it becomes harder to keep the growth going.\n\nThe reason Alphabet still looks like a fantastic buy going into 2026 is that it can still go higher. For a while, investors were skeptical about its ability to continue to dominate in search, its core business, amid concerns that AI chatbots would steer users away from Google. And there may still be many skeptics out there, which is why Alphabet isn't the most valuable company in the world right now, which I believe is where it should rank given how massive its business is.\nAI has enabled Alphabet to enhance Google Search and add value for creators on YouTube. But don't forget that it also has a rapidly expanding robotaxi business in Waymo. Its cloud business is expanding, and the company is also making its own chips.\nIts operations are far more diverse than many other AI stocks out there, including Nvidia's. And yet, Alphabet's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28. That's modest in comparison to the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF where the average forward earnings multiple is just under 30. Alphabet should command a far higher premium than where it's at today, which is why, even at its current valuation, it can be a no-brainer buy heading into next year.\n\nAmazon Another obvious pick looks to be Amazon, whose valuation is $2.4 trillion, which remains firmly behind both Nvidia and Alphabet. Over the past 12 months, Amazon's stock price has actually declined by 4%. This is another example of an AI stock that may be worthy of a higher valuation.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company is known primarily for its online marketplace and its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a terrific growth driver. But in addition to that, Amazon also has a robotaxi business of its own, Zoox. It's not as big or popular as Waymo, but its toaster-designed vehicles look sleeker and more modern and could be more ideal for operating as robotaxis.\n\nAmazon has also been expanding its same-day delivery of fresh groceries to more markets recently, which can steal some market share from rival Walmart . Amazon has done a great job of predicting and anticipating purchases on its online marketplace, and replicating that success with groceries could make that an underrated opportunity where its AI capabilities can shine and give it an advantage.\nGiven the diversification of Amazon's business and plentiful growth opportunities, this is a stock that should also be worth more; it trades at a forward P/E of 27.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing In contrast to the other tech giants listed above, there's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC as it is also known. Its business is not as diversified, and that works to its advantage. TSMC makes chips for tech companies, including Nvidia. Its low-cost operations make it difficult for Intel and other rivals to compete. The Taiwan-based company plays an important role in the AI world due to the industry's dependence on its foundry.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, TSMC's revenue rose by 30%, and its diluted per-share profit jumped by 39%. Not only has its growth been impressive, but it has incredibly strong operating margins of around 50%.\nThe stock has rallied more than 40% this year and has a $1.5 trillion market cap. But with a forward P/E of just under 24, it's the cheapest stock on this list.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "5 predictions for tech and AI in 2026 from mega-bull Dan Ives\n\nSamuel O'Brient\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:11 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nDan Ives, one of Wall Street's biggest tech bulls, released his predictions for 2026.\nHe thinks the AI revolution is just starting, and that investors shouldn't be spooked by bubble talk.\nIves sees big things coming from Tesla , Google, and Apple next year.\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities unveiled his list of top predictions for the tech sector for 2026, and the outspoken tech bull isn't any less optimistic about what the new year holds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he sees big things ahead for Tesla. Shares of Elon Musk's car company hit a record high this week, but Ives predicts even more gains to come.\nMore broadly, the analyst sees the AI story continuing to unfold in 2026, and urges investors to buckle in for another bullish year in the space.\n\"On one hand this is a 4th Industrial Revolution taking shape with the US leading China on tech for the first in 30 years...while on the other hand the trillions of dollars needed to reach the heights of enterprise/consumer AI Revolution have caused nervousness and doubters among investors,\" Ives said in a note on Friday.\nHere are Ives' biggest predictions for tech and AI in 2026.\nTesla rolls out robotaxis in 30 cities\nIves is as bullish as ever on Tesla and believes that the EV leader will expand its robotaxi reach in 2026.\n\"Tesla will successfully launch Robotaxis in over 30 cities in 2026 and start to scale volume production of Cybercabs,\" Ives predicts.\nThe EV maker still has its bears. Ross Gerber told Business Insider recently that he doesn't think Tesla can catch up in the self-driving car race as Waymo advances rapidly, but Ives remains steadfast in his conviction that Musk's company will win the driverless race.\nHe sees Tesla stock rising 26% in his base case and as much as 68% in his bull case.\nOracle advances in the AI data center market\nOracle has struggled recently after a lackluster earnings report that raised some questions about the strength of the AI trade. However, Ives isn't worried about the concern that the company is overspending on AI . He predicts a turnaround is coming for Oracle stock in 2026.\n\"Oracle successfully builds out its datacenter targets, starts to convert its massive RPO AI backlog and hits $250 per share in 2026 despite the dark negative sentiment on the stock today,\" he predicted.\nApple and Google will team up on AI\nTwo of the biggest names in tech are likely to team up in 2026 to help usher in the next phase of AI, according to Ives. He predicts that a joint venture between Apple and Google is coming, one that will help the iPhone maker catch up to competitors in the AI race.\n\nStory Continues\n\"Apple and Google will announce a formal AI partnership around Gemini that will finally cement a real AI strategy for Cupertino,\" Ives said. \"This will ultimately be a subscription service launched in the Apple network and lead to Apple achieving a $5 trillion market cap in 2026.\"\nNebius to be acquired\nAI infrastructure provider Nebius may be one of the next big winners of the AI arms race. The Dutch company is Ives' top pick to be acquired by a Big Tech hyperscaler in 2026. He named Microsoft , Alphabet and Amazon as likely candidates to swoop in and buy it.\nNebius stock is coming off an extremely strong 2025, with 212% year-to-date gains. Ives isn't the only pro who sees it as a likely winner. Market research firm Futurum Group named it among its picks for the top tech stocks for the next generation of AI.\nCybersecurity stocks will surge\nIves is also highly bullish on the cybersecurity industry, touting it as one of the tech market's highest performing subsectors. He named CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks as Wedbush's top picks in the space for the coming year.\nWhile Palo Alto Networks has struggled recently and is only up 2% year-to-date, CrowdStrike has spent the year trending upward with 41% gains. Cybersecurity industry experts have also flagged both stocks as likely winners set to capitalize on rising security demand.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Breaking Down Oracle, the AI Trade, and the Outlook for Tech Earnings\n\nSheraz Mian\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:39 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nOracle’s ORCL relationship with OpenAI has become a never-ending source of market angst, as the tie-in reminds many of questionable vendor-financing practices from the late 1990s. Tied to Oracle’s OpenAI exposure are questions about the company’s financial health and its ability to fund its data center expansion plans.\n\nThe December 10 th quarterly release, which was, at best, mixed, added to Oracle’s woes. Oracle missed consensus revenue and margin expectations and raised its capital expenditure (capex) outlook. The stock’s negative reaction to this quarterly release contrasted with the prior quarterly release in early September, when the stock jumped by more than a third.\nWhen investors typically think of the big Tech players, like Microsoft MSFT or Alphabet GOOGL or even Oracle, they instinctively assume fortress balance sheets and ungodly amounts of operating cash flows. Those assumptions are misplaced in the case of Oracle, as it has been relying lately on the debt markets to fund its ever-rising data center buildout-related capital expenditures.\nOracle’s capex outlay totaled $21.2 billion in fiscal year 2025 (FY ends in May), up from $6.7 billion in FY 2024. The company generated $20.8 billion of free cash flow in FY 2025, meaning it was free cash flow negative for the year. The expectation for the current year (FY 2026) is that Oracle’s $50 billion capex budget is approximately double the amount of operating cash flows it is expected to generate. In fact, Oracle will most likely be free cash flow negative in fiscal year 2027 as well, which means that it will need to tap the debt market to fund its capex budget.\n\nThe chart below provides an overview of Oracle’s debt load and the comparable measure for Microsoft. Long-term debt as a share of the company’s total capital is not the only, nor even the best, measure of balance-sheet leverage, but it is a simple and easily understood indicator of financial flexibility.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWe should keep in mind that Oracle isn’t in any financial distress, as it currently has an ‘investment grade’ credit rating from the rating agencies. That said, its credit rating of BBB (from S&P) is the lowest rung of investment-grade credit rating.\nWe are all familiar with the market’s concerns about the broader ‘AI trade’, which ranges from the ‘bubble narrative’ at one extreme to reasonable questions about the monetization of AI investments at the other.\nThe chart below shows the three-month performance of Oracle shares relative to Alphabet, Microsoft, the Zacks Tech sector, and the S&P 500 index.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe ongoing issues in Oracle shares are not a reflection of those AI concerns, as the chart above clearly shows, but rather a function of the aforementioned OpenAI exposure and concerns about its financial health. We would have seen far more solidarity from Microsoft and Alphabet with Oracle in the above period had the overriding issue been the ‘AI trade’.\n\nOne key performance metric that took center stage in the Oracle story is Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), which reached $523 billion this quarter, up $455 billion from the preceding quarter. For reference, the comparable number for Microsoft reached $392 billion in the company’s latest quarterly report.\nThink of this key performance metric as Oracle’s backlog or future revenues had jumped by an eye-popping $317 billion in the preceding quarter. The bearish narrative on Oracle notes that $300 billion of the preceding quarter’s $317 billion RPO growth was attributable to OpenAI.\nIt is this elevated level of customer concentration risk, coupled with Oracle’s relatively stretched financial health, that has been weighing on the stock lately.\n\nA fair assessment of the evolving Oracle story is that while there is undoubtedly more uncertainty and risk associated with its RPO (or backlog) getting converted into future revenues, particularly say relative to Microsoft or Alphabet, it is nevertheless a key element of the company’s growth profile and its status as a critical player in the emerging AI world.\nIn other words, no one should be under the impression that this is a second coming of Enron or other such dubious characters from our collective past.\nThe chart below provides a 10-year comparison of Oracle valuation relative to Microsoft, using the forward 12-month P/E multiple. As you can see here, Oracle shares broke away from their historically discounted valuation to Microsoft only in May 2025, but have now reversed all of those gains.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis 10-year history shows that Oracle shares have commanded as high as 66% premium (September 2025) to Microsoft share to a 55% discount (November 2020), with a 10-year median of 28% discount. The stock is currently trading at an 18% discount to Microsoft shares (23.6X for Oracle vs. 28.7X for Microsoft).\n\nThe lower discount relative to history makes sense when seen in the context of Oracle’s emerging status as a key player in the emerging AI world. Oracle bulls would likely argue that there is no justification for the ‘new Oracle’ to trade at a discount to Microsoft going forward, notwithstanding its balance sheet vulnerability.\nTech Earnings Outlook The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth outlook for the Zacks Tech sector on a quarterly basis, where we highlight expectations for 2025 Q4 in the context of what the sector achieved in the preceding two quarters and what is expected in the following three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector has been critical to driving aggregate earnings growth for the last 9 quarters (since 2023 Q3), and the above chart shows that it is expected to continue playing that role in the coming periods as well.\nPlease note that the Tech sector has been consistently enjoying positive estimate revisions over the past year, and we saw the same trend at play since the start of 2025 Q4 in October. In fact, had it not been for positive revisions to Tech sector estimates, aggregate Q4 earnings estimates for the S&P 500 index would be modestly down since the start of October.\nThe chart below shows the sector’s earnings growth picture on an annual basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe positive revisions trend that we referenced for the Tech sector in the context of 2025 Q4 earnings estimates is very much in place for full-year 2026 estimates as well, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector is not ordinary; it accounts for nearly a third of S&P 500 earnings, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Outlook for the Mag 7 The Mag 7 group is generally seen as mega-cap Tech players. However, in the Zacks sector classification system, two of the Mag 7 players are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; we place Amazon in the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla in the Zacks Auto sector. Both of these sectors are Zacks innovations, as the ‘official’ Standard & Poor’s industry classification does not have stand-alone sectors for the retail and auto spaces.\nFor 2025 Q4, the Mag 7 group is expected to produce +16.9% earnings growth on +16.4% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the Mag 7 group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the group’s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +16.6%, followed by +18% in 2027.\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26.4% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.6% weight in the index.\n2025 Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Last week’s Oracle earnings report was for the company’s fiscal quarter ending in November, which we and other research organizations count as part of the December-quarter tally. Oracle is hardly alone in this respect, and quarterly results from the likes of FedEx, Nike, Adobe, and others fall in the same category. Through Friday, December 19 th , we have seen such Q4 results from 18 S&P 500 members.\nTotal earnings for these 18 index members are up +32.2% from the same period last year on +9% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates from these companies in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below show the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows current Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&P 500 index in the context of the preceding 4 quarters and the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Q4 Earnings: Tech Expected to Remain Growth Driver\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Why is Google Quietly Funneling Billions Into Bitcoin Miners?\n\nFatima\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:32 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nBTC-USD\n\nIREN\n\nGoogle has quietly become a financial safety net for Bitcoin miners, providing at least $5 billion in credit support to help them pivot into Artificial Intelligence (AI). This isn&#8217;t a direct investment but something much smarter: a guarantee. Stocks of miners making this move, like Cipher and IREN, have surged between 300-500% in 2025 as a result.\n\nWhat Is Really Happening Between Google and Bitcoin Miners? This trend is a direct response to AI’s massive hunger for power, a resource that Bitcoin miners have in abundance. As the AI sector in crypto grows, the demand for this kind of infrastructure is exploding.\nSo, how does it work? Think of Google as a wealthy parent co-signing a lease for their child (the Bitcoin miner). The bank (like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs) sees Google’s guarantee and feels safe enough to lend the money for a big project.\n\nMiners like Hut 8, TeraWulf, and Cipher Mining provide the land and power connections. A data-center operator called Fluidstack signs a long-term lease, and Google financially backs Fluidstack&#8217;s obligations. This clever structure turns a volatile crypto company into a bank-friendly infrastructure project.\nVisiting TeraWulf&#8217;s Lake Mariner site makes it clear: this AI pivot isn&#8217;t just software. HPC clusters need liquid-to-chip cooling, far beyond standard Bitcoin air-cooling, which is why build-out costs are so high.\nIt&#8217;s important to note that Google isn&#8217;t handing out this credit for free. In exchange for backing these deals, the company has taken equity warrants in the miners, about 14% in TeraWulf and 5.4% in Cipher. This effectively makes the guarantee a cost of capital, aligning Google&#8217;s upside with the miners&#8217; success while ensuring the tech giant benefits if these AI pivots pay off.\n\nDISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2025\nWhy This Signals a Major Shift for Crypto This is a huge vote of confidence. For years, banks viewed Bitcoin miners as too risky to finance. Their income depends on Bitcoin&#8217;s wild price swings and the ever-increasing difficulty of mining.\nNow, Google’s backing transforms them into stable, predictable businesses in the eyes of Wall Street. According to Yahoo Finance, this pivot is allowing miners to secure revenue streams that are far more reliable than mining alone. With the average cost to produce one Bitcoin nearing $75,000, finding a stable income is a top priority.\nThis signals a new wave of institutional Bitcoin demand , not for the coin itself, but for the powerful infrastructure that supports the network. It legitimizes the entire industry, connecting it directly to the biggest technology story of the decade: AI.\n\nStory Continues\nDISCOVER: 10+ Next Crypto to 100X In 2025\nWhat Are the Hidden Risks for Investors? While the opportunity is clear, it comes with serious strings attached. Bitcoin miners have always operated in a world of “best-effort” power. If something goes down, it&#8217;s a missed opportunity. AI clients, however, demand near-perfect uptime and reliability.\nThis transition requires a complete overhaul of a miner&#8217;s operations and culture. Failure to meet strict service agreements could lead to contract breaches, not just lost revenue. A Reuters report on Bitfarms highlights these operational hurdles as a key challenge.\n\nFurthermore, the entire deal structure relies on the intermediary, Fluidstack, and Google’s long-term commitment. If the AI boom cools or contracts are renegotiated, miners are left exposed. They are betting that Google will remain the ultimate backstop for over a decade.\nThis convergence of crypto and AI is a powerful narrative, marking the start of a potential institutional crypto supercycle. It redefines what a mining company can be, shifting from pure-play crypto exposure to a core infrastructure provider for the future of technology, including further institutional blockchain adoption. This evolution could be the key to their long-term survival and growth.\nDISCOVER: 9+ Best High-Risk, High-Reward Crypto to Buy in 2025\nRead original story Why is Google Quietly Funneling Billions Into Bitcoin Miners? by Peter O'Neill at 99bitcoins.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "RTO mandates to AI agents: How work is changing in 2026 and beyond\n\nRob Lenihan\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:29 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThere are so many songs about work that even Google can’t give you an exact number.\nThere must be thousands of tunes about the daily grind, such as Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5,” the Bangles’ “Manic Monday,” Loverboy’s “Working for the Weekend,” and Johnny Paycheck’s “Take this Job and Shove It.”\nAbout the only ones who seemed to enjoy singing about their careers were the Seven Dwarfs who heigh-hoed off to work in Snow White —and they were cartoon characters.\n\nThe workplace has changed dramatically over the years, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down offices as people worked from home and telecommuted using Zoom and other digital conferencing tools.\nLooking ahead, analysts see even more changes coming to the workplace, where the average person spends roughly one-third of their life.\nReturn-to-office calls got noticeably louder in 2025, Robert Half said, with many large employers rolling out firmer in-office expectations and enforcement—Amazon ( AMZN ), Dell ( DELL ), Walmart ( WMT ), and Starbucks ( SBUX ) were among the major employers to issue RTO mandates.\nAt the same time, the staffing firm said, data indicated that for remote-capable roles, “hybrid work arrangements remained the dominant model—and employee preferences barely budged toward fully on-site work.”\n\n“In general, companies that treated work flexibility as a strategic tool for employee engagement saw better outcomes than those focused on badge counts,” Robert Half said.\nRelated: What is coffee badging? The hybrid work buzzword explained\n“Expect to see fewer performative mandates and more structured models for flexible work guided by what the data shows about employee productivity, satisfaction and retention.”\nThe firm noted that one of the most significant 2025 workplace trends was businesses of all sizes leaning more heavily on contract and interim talent to keep projects moving and access hard-to-find skills.\nAnalysts see rise of AI agents In 2026, the move toward scalable staffing will become a long-term strategy for how work gets done in many companies, Robert Half said, as “economic uncertainty, evolving regulations, AI and tech upgrades, and ongoing project backlogs make it harder to rely on permanent headcount alone.”\nArtificial intelligence will play a bigger role in the workplace, but McKinsey analysts believe that 2026 will be the year of agentic AI, which operates with autonomy with minimal human oversight—unlike traditional AI, which requires step-by-step guidance.\nMore on jobs:\nGoldman Sachs makes unemployment prediction\nHow Work Conditions Impact Mental Health\nNovember BLS jobs data show the good, bad, and ugly, analysts say\nCooling jobs report resets Fed interest-rate cut bet\n\nStory Continues\n“As we move into 2026, companies have the opportunity to advance beyond incremental gains from copilots, chatbots, and other reactive, gen AI–based tools,” the firm said in a recent report. “The best are acting now to transform workflows, functions, and, ultimately, their entire organizations by onboarding AI agents to work side by side with their people.”\n\nAI will not make most human skills obsolete, but it will change how they are used, McKinsey said, “with AI handling more common tasks, people will apply their skills in new contexts.”\nAnalysts at PwC believe that AI could soon end a shift that has marked most of the industrial era—the ever-increasing specialization of work.\n“Agents can increasingly do the specialized tasks that fill the workdays of experienced, mid-tier employees,” the accounting and auditing firm said. “In IT, for example, you may no longer need coders specialized in specific languages. Instead, you may want engineers who understand both tech architecture and how to manage and oversee the agents that do know these languages.”\nIn finance, PwC said that as agents do tasks like invoice processing, purchase order matching, reconciliation, and anomaly detection, “people with general finance skills can focus on growing revenue and expanding margins, engaging with vendors on payment terms, working with sales on dynamic pricing models, and conducting more scenario planning.”\n\n“In knowledge work, many of these roles can be filled by entry-level employees who tend to be AI savvy,” the firm said.\nSurvey: Employees value workplace culture There will be challenges, however, with Deloitte noting that “most enterprises today simply aren’t set up to take advantage of the opportunities for automation that agents present.”\n“However, we’re starting to see signs at leading organizations that these challenges can be surmounted through strategic process redesign, architectural modernization, and new governance frameworks,” the firm said.\n\nRelated: Quantum computing making big leap, analysts say\nHow do employees feel about work?\nWell, 60% of those responding to the 2025 EY US Generation Survey said culture is a major factor in their decision to stay in their jobs.\n“US workers may be feeling the strain of a slow job market, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and economic uncertainty, but when it comes to their priorities, workplace culture is at the top of the list,” the firm said.\nThe most important aspect of workplace culture is the way people interact, according to the survey of 5,000 US white-collar workers at organizations with 5,000 employees or more.\nNearly 30%—the single biggest response—reported that the most valuable aspect of company culture is “how people treat each other,” beating out leadership and management style, work environment, seeing the company’s values in action, or feeling the company prioritizes their career growth.\n\n“The US workplace continues to evolve,” Leslie Patterson, EY Americas and US Inclusiveness Leader, said in a statement. “Gen Z and millennials, in particular, are driving change, but all generations are looking beyond compensation and prioritizing relationships, connections and values.”\n“Many organizations are focused on AI and other emerging technologies that are critical to a competitive advantage,” Patterson added. “But they should also keep their people front and center and look for ways to address the needs of all generations.”\nRelated: Movies struggle for place in changing entertainment market\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 19, 2025, where it first appeared in the Employment section.

      "Content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW): Evaluating Valuation After New Multibillion-Dollar AI Security Deal With Google Cloud\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: PANW\n\nGOOG\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) just doubled down on AI security by striking a multibillion-dollar expansion of its Google Cloud partnership to hardwire its Prisma AIRS platform into Google’s core AI and infrastructure stack.\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks.\nThe stock has been choppy recently, with the 30 day share price return down 7.0 percent and the 1 year total shareholder return roughly flat. However, a 3 year total shareholder return above 160 percent shows longer term momentum is still intact.\n\nIf this AI security deal has you thinking bigger about the space, it is a good moment to scan high growth tech and AI stocks for other potential winners riding similar trends.\nAnalysts still see meaningful upside from today’s price, with PANW trading at a double digit discount to both consensus targets and some intrinsic value estimates. But after a big multiyear run, is this a fresh entry point, or is the market already baking in Palo Alto’s next leg of AI driven growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 17.2% Undervalued With Palo Alto Networks closing at $185.88 against a narrative fair value near the mid $220s, the story frames today’s price as leaving notable upside on the table.\nEnhanced operating efficiencies from scale, a higher mix of software sales, prudent cost controls, and a strong deferred payments portfolio have already led to expanding operating margins (now above 30%) and high free cash flow margins (38%+ with structural visibility to 40%+), directly benefiting future earnings, free cash flow, and shareholder returns.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how double digit growth, rising margins, and a triple digit future earnings multiple can still argue for upside? The underlying projections may surprise you.\nResult: Fair Value of $224.53 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, heavy integration demands from ongoing acquisitions and intensifying AI security competition could challenge Palo Alto’s growth assumptions and put pressure on its premium valuation.\nFind out about the key risks to this Palo Alto Networks narrative.\nAnother Lens on Valuation Not everyone sees upside. On a price to earnings basis, Palo Alto Networks trades at about 116 times earnings, versus 31 times for the US software industry and 44 times for peers, while our fair ratio sits near 43. This gap signals real de rating risk if growth wobbles.\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own Palo Alto Networks Narrative If you see the numbers differently or want to stress test your own thesis, you can craft a personalized view in just a few minutes: Do it your way .\n\nStory Continues\nA great starting point for your Palo Alto Networks research is our analysis highlighting 3 key rewards and 2 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\nLooking for more investment ideas?

The company has added new verification labels to its Gemini app that let people check if a video was created or edited using Google's AI tools.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe idea is simple and hands on. Users can upload a video into Gemini and ask a direct question like whether it was generated with Google AI. Gemini then scans the video for hidden watermarks embedded in both the audio and visuals. These markers are invisible to the human eye and ear, but they allow Gemini to identify which parts of a video include AI generated content.\nAlphabet said the feature supports videos up to 100 MB and 90 seconds long and is now available globally across all languages where Gemini operates. Image verification is also included.\nThe timing matters. As AI generated video becomes more convincing, spotting what is authentic is getting harder. Alphabet's move is less about flashy features and more about trust. By building verification directly into Gemini, Google is giving users a clearer way to slow misinformation and better understand what they are actually watching.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Here's 1 Reason Why.\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet's ability to grow earnings at a double-digit pace will drive the share price higher over time.\nManagement is focused on leveraging AI capabilities to support customers and users, which will help increase ad sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is ready to close out 2025 with a bang. The dominant internet business has seen its shares skyrocket 62% so far this year (as of Dec. 16), thanks to robust financial results and a leading position in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\nThis top tech stock has historically been a great investment. And I predict that it will soar over the next five years. Here's one reason why.\nHigher earnings can propel shares through the rest of the decade Benjamin Graham famously suggested that over the long term, the market is a weighing machine, as fundamentals run the show. Along the same vein, Alphabet shares will be lifted by much higher profits in 2030.\nIn the past five years, the company's net income climbed at a compound annual rate of 26%. Wall Street consensus estimates call for earnings per share to rise at a yearly clip of 17% between 2024 and 2027. I expect double-digit gains to continue past that forecast period.\n\nTherefore, it wouldn't be surprising at all to see Alphabet's stock price double by the end of the decade.\nDigital ad growth will be a key factor Alphabet's bread and butter continues to be its digital ad efforts, representing almost 75% of its revenue base. With the business leveraging AI tools not only to improve customers' ad targeting capabilities, but to bolster its various user-facing products and services, Alphabet is in a favorable position.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $506,935 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,067,514 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 958 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 192% for the S&P 500.

I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could the ‘Full House’ Family Afford San Francisco in 2025?\n\nLaura Beck\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:06 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThe “Full House” Tanner family lived in a gorgeous Victorian house in San Francisco with three kids, three adults and somehow made it work on the salaries of a TV host, a struggling musician and a stand-up comedian. That setup worked great for a sitcom in the 1980s and ’90s, but the math gets brutal when you apply 2025 San Francisco economics to their situation.\n\nThe question isn’t whether they’d struggle. It’s whether they could afford to live there at all without someone secretly being a millionaire. (One of them might be — after all, they lived in San Francisco! Maybe Uncle Jesse wrote a jingle for Google?) Here’s a look at how their finances measure up to the cost of living .\nSan Francisco’s Cost of Living Hits Hard A family of four needs roughly $127,000 yearly to cover basic expenses in San Francisco. That’s just baseline living, not comfortable existence with savings and extras .\nFor what researchers call a modest but adequate standard of living including housing, food, child care, transportation, healthcare and taxes, a two-parent two-child family needs approximately $181,277 yearly. The central “Full House” crew had six people, which pushes costs even higher.\n\nMedian rent tells part of the story. A one-bedroom apartment averages $3,019 monthly while a two-bedroom runs $3,579. The Tanners would need at minimum a three-bedroom, realistically a four-bedroom. That’s easily $5,000 to $7,000 monthly just for rent in a standard apartment, not a Victorian house.\nFind Out: Could Homer Simpson Support His Family in 2025?\nRead Next: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\nWhat the Characters Actually Earned Danny Tanner worked as a morning TV host on “Wake Up San Francisco.” Comparably says this job will bring in the average salary of about $60,202. Although the average in San Jose, California, which is near San Francisco is $118,862. (And it’s good to note that there is a range that goes up to $276,379, and we don’t know how popular Danny or the show are.)\n\nAs a working musician (band member/jingle-writer), the typical U.S. musician like Uncle Jesse earns about $43,790 a year. If he supplemented that with radio/announcing work, median pay for “broadcast announcers/radio DJs” is about US $21.96/hour, but the work tends to be irregular. Maybe he also supplements this writing jingles, which might bring in an extra $10,000 a year, with some years bringing in more, and some years bringing in less.\nAs a (non-celebrity) comedian, Uncle Joey would maybe make $57,392 a year. He might supplement that with sporadic voice acting gigs, so that could be an extra windfall of $5,000 a year, but sometimes maybe more or less.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Combined Household Math Adding the three adult incomes together gives a household range of about $180,000 to $250,000 annually. That sounds like a lot of money until you remember they lived in San Francisco.\nThe actual “Full House” Victorian house sold in 2025 for over $6 million. A mortgage on a $6 million house with 20% down would run approximately $35,000 monthly before property taxes and insurance. Add those costs and you’re looking at $40,000 to $45,000 monthly or roughly $480,000 to $540,000 annually just for housing.\n\nZillow says if you wanted to rent that very same Victorian, it would cost $8,290 a month. At the low end that’s $100,000 yearly just for rent before any other expenses.\nThe Reality Check The combined household income of $180,000 to $250,000 can’t support housing costs of $120,000 to $480,000 annually while also covering food, child care, transportation, healthcare and everything else for six people. The math doesn’t work unless someone inherited the house mortgage-free or bought it decades earlier when prices were drastically lower.\n\nAnalysis of TV characters’ housing affordability confirmed that the “Full House” family’s income couldn’t realistically support their housing costs. The show never addressed this gap, which is fine because it’s fiction and the house functioned as a character itself.\nHow They Could Make It Work The Tanner family could afford San Francisco in 2025 only under specific conditions. Danny would need to be a top-tier TV personality earning $250,000 or more. Jesse would need consistent high-paying jingle contracts or a successful music career bringing in $120,000 plus. Joey would need major voice acting gigs generating $100,000 annually. Even then they’d need to rent a standard apartment, not a Victorian mansion.\n\nThe more realistic scenario involves downsizing dramatically to a three-bedroom apartment, running an extremely tight budget , sacrificing savings and extras and still feeling financially stretched.

      "Content": "AI hyperscalers have room for ‘elevated debt issuance’ — even after their recent bond binge, BofA says\n\nJason Ma\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BAC\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThe tech giants fueling the AI boom generate so much cash relative to their debt that they have more than enough room to issue more, according to Bank of America .\nIn a note this week, analysts looked at the top five publicly traded AI hyperscalers: Meta , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Oracle .\nBofA pointed out that while the companies can fund their near-term capital expenditures with cash, they are tapping debt markets for balance-sheet flexibility and better cost of capital. Last month alone, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon raised tens of billions of dollars in the bond market.\n\nOperating cash flow for the big five hyperscalers is expected to hit $577 billion this year from $378 billion in 2023, while debt should climb from $356 billion to $433 billion.\nThat means their overall debt burden is actually getting lighter as the debt-to-cash ratio should dip from 0.94 to 0.75.\n“Given the hyperscalers’ historically conservative capital allocation and balance sheet policies, elevated debt issuance is possible, as evident by the recent bond deals from Meta, Alphabet and Amazon,” BofA said.\nAnd plenty of additional cash is on the way. By 2029, operating cash flow is seen jumping 95% to $1.1 trillion, while capex is forecast to grow at a much slower pace of 58% to $632 billion.\nBut then there’s Oracle. Unlike the other AI hyperscalers, it will have negative free cash flow until 2029, meaning its capex will exceed cash from operations, according to BofA. As a result, it doesn’t have much capacity to take on more debt.\n\nIndeed, fears about Oracle’s debt binge have rattled the overall AI stock trade as the company isn’t a cash machine like its AI peers.\nRecent earnings guidance was also weak, and the company raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 capex by another $15 billion. In addition, surging lease obligations have spooked Wall Street.\nA Financial Times report on Wednesday that said alternative investments firm Blue Owl didn’t team up with Oracle on a data center after all piled on more concerns. Shares fell on the news, though the company’s development partner, Related Digital, said Blue Owl was outbid on the project and didn’t back out of it.\nBut even though debt may not pose a limit on hyperscalers’ ambitions, they still face physical limits , namely in building enough infrastructure fast enough to meet demand.\nData-center researcher Jonathan Koomey told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg that capital can be deployed instantly, but the equipment that capital must buy cannot. Tmelines for turbines, transformers, specialized cooling systems, and high-voltage gear have stretched into years, he explained.\n\nStory Continues\n“This happens every time there’s a massive shift in investment,” Koomey added. “Eventually manufacturers catch up, but not right away. Reality intervenes.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The all-stock deal values each TAE share at $53.89, though TAE is privately held, leaving the precise valuation of its equity portion unclear. Trump Media, which has a market capitalization of around $2.9 billion, plans to provide $200 million in cash at closing, which the companies expect to occur in mid-2026, with ownership of the combined entity split roughly evenly.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DJT.\nIs DJT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nExecutives said the combination brings together Trump Media's access to capital and TAE's fusion technology to pursue long-term energy solutions for AI-driven infrastructure. The merged company expects to begin construction next year on a 50-megawatt utility-scale fusion power plant, subject to regulatory approvals, and is targeting first power generation in 2031. Management also outlined ambitions to develop additional fusion facilities capable of generating between 350 and 500 megawatts each, while acknowledging that fusion is not yet commercially viable and continues to face significant scientific and engineering hurdles.\n\nThe deal would be led by co-CEOs Devin Nunes and TAE founder Michl Binderbauer, with Donald Trump Jr. joining a nine-member board, as executives pointed to the goal of creating the first publicly traded nuclear fusion company in the U.S. Founded in 1998, TAE is among the world's oldest private fusion ventures and counts Alphabet, Chevron, Goldman Sachs, and several prominent family offices among its backers. The agreement comes amid surging AI-related electricity demand and increased policy focus on energy infrastructure, including a national energy emergency declaration and executive orders aimed at accelerating data-center and power development, trends that could keep fusion in focus as a potential long-term solution.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAs is the case with other technology giants, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has positioned itself to be a key player in the AI race. The firm differs from players such as Google and Amazon through the fact that it does not operate a cloud computing business.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a key player in the AI industry due to several factors. These include the firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its in-house Trainium AI chips. The highly competitive cloud computing industry, which sees investors demand high growth rates, has also affected Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2025. As an example, the shares dipped in August after the firm’s second-quarter earnings saw AWS post a 17.5% revenue growth, which was slower than Microsoft and Google’s cloud growth rates of 39% and 32%, respectively.\nZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.com\nAWS has also been the focus of recent analyst coverage for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s shares. For instance, Guggenheim initiated coverage on December 10th as it set a Buy rating and a $300 share price target. The research firm cited AWS as the reason behind its coverage and shared that the business’s 3.8-year backlog had touched $200 billion in Q2. Cramer also discussed the AWS business. He insisted that the cloud business will drive the narrative, and commented on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) after BMO Capital raised the share price target to $304 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating, and raised the Q1 2026 AWS cloud growth estimate to 24% from an earlier 23%.

Alphabet: Which Could Be The World's Biggest Company By End-2026?\n\nPiero Cingari\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trails with a 14% chance, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) at 9%.\nTesla Inc . (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits , suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google , OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data.

      "Content": "Buffett Leaving Berkshire Creates a ‘Vacuum Risk’ and a $381 Billion Question\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:18 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nBA\n\nBRK-B\n\nGOOG\n\nQuick Read Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) is underperforming the S&P 500 in a rare break from a two-decade trend as Warren Buffett prepares to step down as CEO.\nThe departure of Todd Combs to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) raises concerns about future stock selection and internal investment leadership.\nBerkshire’s $341 billion cash position reflects valuation discipline, but investors are increasingly focused on how effectively the next generation will deploy capital.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video I started the discussion by acknowledging something that feels almost unnatural for long-time Berkshire watchers. Warren Buffett is struggling, at least by his own historic standards. With Buffett expected to step away from the CEO role within weeks, Lee and I agreed that the timing of recent events has only amplified investor anxiety.\n\nA rare break from long-term outperformance Lee reminded me that we have covered Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway for nearly 20 years, and since 2000 the company has outperformed the S&P 500 almost every single year. That streak is coming to an end. The stock has gone through a rocky period, and that kind of volatility is not what investors associate with Buffett’s steady hand. Once Buffett publicly committed to stepping aside, the margin for error narrowed, and the market has become far less forgiving.\n\nTodd Combs and the vacuum risk The most troubling development we discussed was the departure of Todd Combs. As one of Buffett’s two key proteges, Combs played a central role in portfolio management and in supporting Greg Abel, the executive expected to lead Berkshire going forward. When Combs left to take a role at JPMorgan Chase, it immediately raised a hard question. Who finds the next great ideas?\n\nLee pointed out that Combs or his investment cohort were likely behind Berkshire’s position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Even though Buffett was late to that trade, it remains one of Berkshire’s most strategically important modern holdings. The concern now is whether there is another investor inside Berkshire capable of sourcing similar opportunities in a market that is far more complex than it was twenty years ago.\nSelling stocks and stockpiling cash Another focal point of our conversation was Berkshire’s enormous cash hoard, now roughly $341 billion. I argued that this is not a sign of confusion, but discipline. Berkshire’s cash balance will likely continue to grow until markets correct and valuations become more attractive. Whether Buffett himself or his successors pull the trigger, there are clearly stocks the team likes. They just do not like them at current prices.\n\nStory Continues\nLee agreed, noting that patience has always been core to Berkshire’s DNA. The difference now is that investors are watching closely to see whether that patience translates into decisive action once opportunity appears.\nWhat might come next Lee brought up Boeing (NYSE: BA) as a potential example of the type of company Berkshire could target. After years of turmoil following the 737 Max crashes and operational failures, Boeing has begun to stabilize and has secured large new orders. Historically, Berkshire has favored exactly these kinds of battered but essential companies that are likely to survive and recover.\n\nCore holdings still dominate We closed by looking at the current portfolio. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains Berkshire’s largest holding by a wide margin, even after substantial trimming. The same is true for Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) , which has also been reduced significantly. How aggressively the next leadership team continues to reshape these positions will say a lot about Berkshire’s future identity.\n\nFor now, Berkshire sits at an inflection point. Underperformance, executive departures, and a looming leadership transition have unsettled even its most loyal shareholders. Whether that uncertainty creates an opportunity or signals a longer adjustment period will depend on how effectively the post-Buffett team proves it can do what Buffett did better than anyone else.\nTranscript: [00:00:00] Lee Jackson: Now let's talk about Tom Combs leaving and how it's underperformed, et cetera.\n[00:00:06] Doug McIntyre: Warren Buffett has been having a tough time now. He'll be retiring, I think in about three weeks. But yeah, he's\n[00:00:12] Lee Jackson: pretty much out the door from\n\n[00:00:13] Doug McIntyre: the CEO slot. Since he said he was gonna leave, he's had some real problems.\n[00:00:19] Part of it is departures of senior people, but the other one is the stock has been, it's been a rocky period for the stock, which, it's not traditional for him.\n[00:00:31] Lee Jackson: No, because we had done some work on this 'cause we've covered Buffett and Berkshire for almost 20 years here at 24/7. And, literally since 2000, he outperformed the s and p 500 almost every year, if not every year.\n[00:00:47] That ain't gonna be the case this year. And yeah, I think, It's not surprising when people leave. Just ask Old Miss. But, when, somebody like Todd Combs walks out the door, he was one of the two, Buffett proteges, that were helping him with the portfolio, helping the guy that's stepping in to be the new CEO, he was, they were the guys that were helping him.\n\n[00:01:14] When Todd takes a, job at JP Morgan to do. Some investment strategy stuff. I'm, I don't really remember exactly what he's gonna do there, but a, he must have got a huge paycheck to go there, and he's probably filthy rich anyway, because he is been at Berkshire for years. But that's not a good sign for Berkshire.\n[00:01:33] That's not a good sign because who's gonna be the stock pickers? who's gonna find the new ideas? And I think you know, it, was probably him or his, cohort that suggested Google. Even though, Buffett was late to the Google purchase, it's in there. And as, as you've said a lot, and it's been your favorite big name, is there gonna be somebody to find more good ideas like that?\n\n[00:02:00] Because all they've been doing is selling for the last couple of years, and they have that huge pile of cash, like 341 billion of cash. So. Do you think that, I think some investors, especially longtime investors, are concerned that is every anybody else gonna go, the other people gonna\n[00:02:20] Doug McIntyre: leave. Well, there's a second part about this and that is everybody talks about the cash.\n[00:02:25] The cash on that balance is going to grow until the market drops. Right. It may not be Buffett, it may be as proteges, but there are a bunch of people sitting there who love some stocks and they're waiting for them to get to the point where they think that they're a good buy. Yeah. They love the stocks.\n[00:02:43] They love them now, but they don't love 'em at these prices.\n\n[00:02:48] Lee Jackson: Yeah. I agree. And it's funny, I. there was an upgrade for Boeing, and Boeing's gotten some huge orders and it's been a nightmare over the last five years, the 737 max crashes and, all of that stuff, and it's gonna probably be a name like Boeing or, maybe some other company that's been beaten down hard, but, will survive and exist.\n[00:03:10] But yeah, it's gonna be interesting how. The portfolio evolves going forward. 'cause a, apple is still the biggest position by far. Yeah. But you know, they've sold a ton of that. They sold a ton of Bank of America and it'll be interesting to see how things go and it'll be interesting to see if investors start to buy a lower Berkshire or continue to sell it.\n\n[00:03:35] Doug McIntyre: Yeah\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "The AI Data Center Reality Check, Oracle Stumbles and China Looms Over US Valuations\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:16 AM PST 13 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nQuick Read Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) missed revenue expectations and pushed out key data center timelines to 2028, triggering a broad reassessment of near-term AI infrastructure returns.\nMassive capital requirements, power constraints, and transformer shortages suggest AI monetization will lag investment by several years, raising return-on-equity concerns across the sector.\nChina’s ability to rapidly deploy energy and data center capacity could pressure US AI valuations as competition shifts from software innovation to infrastructure scale.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video Our conversation began with a simple observation. A lot has happened in AI over the past week, and not all of it has been good. Lee opened by pointing directly at Oracle’s earnings report, which on its own would have looked solid for most technology companies. The problem, as we both agreed, is that Oracle is no longer being valued like most tech companies. It is being valued as a core pillar of the AI data center buildout.\n\nWhen Oracle failed to meet revenue expectations and suggested that large-scale data centers may not be ready until 2028, it immediately chilled sentiment across the entire sector. On the same day the Dow pushed to new highs, the Nasdaq was hit hard, with anything even loosely tied to AI selling off aggressively. That divergence told us the market was reassessing the timeline, not the technology.\nWhy the data center story moved too fast I argued that there are two realities investors are only now starting to price in. First, most AI companies are realizing they are not going to make meaningful money for several years. They will need to invest hundreds of billions of dollars before returns show up, even if some of that capital comes from private equity or bank financing. Second, building data centers is slow, politically complicated, and infrastructure-heavy.\n\nLee and I discussed the growing resistance to data centers at the local level. Water usage, electricity consumption, and rising power rates are becoming flashpoints. A single large data center can consume as much electricity as an entire country like Luxembourg. That kind of demand requires massive upgrades to grids, transformers, and transmission systems, many of which already face shortages and multi-year lead times.\nThe myth of rapid AI saturation We both pushed back on the idea that the world could be blanketed with AI data centers in a year or two. Even with unlimited money, it simply is not possible. Transformers alone can take years to source and deploy. These bottlenecks mean that the AI revolution, while real, will unfold far more slowly than early bulls assumed.\n\nStory Continues\nLee noted that AI enthusiasm has been building for roughly three years, dating back to OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022. The narrative focused almost entirely on how AI would change everything, and we both believe it will. But as history shows, transformative technologies also produce waves of failed companies. Just as many internet pioneers disappeared after the dot-com boom, AI is likely to see a significant thinning of the herd within the next two to three years.\n\nValuations and the coming shakeout I said bluntly that two years from now there will be blood in the streets. Competition is intensifying rapidly. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is already catching up in key areas, and new models from Anthropic and others continue to enter the field. OpenAI is not going out of business, but whether it ultimately justifies valuations approaching $500 billion remains an open question.\n\nThe China factor investors underestimate One of the most important risks we discussed is China. Lee referenced recent reporting highlighting China’s ability to deploy power infrastructure at extraordinary speed. Solar arrays, nuclear plants, and effectively unlimited electricity give China a structural advantage in scaling AI data centers. I emphasized that great technology alone is not enough. If China can build data centers in every region without regulatory friction, US AI valuations could face serious pressure from overseas competition, not just from domestic rivals.\n\nWhat investors should do now Lee made the point that companies like Google and Oracle will survive, but the return on the staggering amounts already invested will take time. I agreed and offered practical advice. If an investor has tripled their money in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , they should take some profits. Half is a perfectly reasonable number. Markets have a long history of sharp corrections that erase gains faster than people expect.\n\nWe also touched on utilities and even speculative ideas like space-based solar power, but the conclusion was straightforward. AI is real, transformative, and here to stay. The timeline, however, is longer, more expensive, and more competitive than the market originally priced in. For investors sitting on large gains, caution and discipline matter more now than enthusiasm.\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: So, Lee, we've had a whole bunch of stuff go on in the world of AI in the last week, and not all of it’s been good. We have some of these weeks where everything is good. What's happened in the last week or so that's really not as good?\n[00:00:19] Lee Jackson: Well, I think the most dynamic thing is, and it has really kind of pushed the whole sector down, and we're on, we're talking on Friday, in the week when Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) still posted, by most tech companies’ standards, strong numbers. Oh God. Yeah. They were great. It would've been really, really good.\n\n[00:00:38] But Oracle is not most tech companies, and they were basically, people are starting to think that they didn't hit the revenue numbers and now they've pushed out the data center readiness to 2028. Uh-oh. That's not what everybody had on their scorecard.\n[00:00:57] So I think it has really put a chill in the whole sector, and as today you can see, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average streams to new highs, the NASDAQ just gets absolutely hammered. Everything that's even related to the industry is getting hammered. So I think it's kind of, I guess the question is, is this just\n[00:01:21] a hiccup in the bigger AI story, which I'm sure the real big AI bulls would say, or, is maybe the whole AI data center universe moving a little too fast?\n\n[00:01:36] Doug McIntyre: I think there are two parts to it. Number one: I'm pretty sure most of these companies are starting to look at themselves and say, I'm not gonna make any real money on this for a couple of years.\n[00:01:49] I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to invest literally hundreds of billions of dollars. I may get some of that from private equity or banks, so I may not be playing with my own money. The other thing is, and I want to stress this, it takes a long time to build a data center, and there are a lot of hurdles.\n[00:02:08] One hurdle now is a lot of people don't want data centers near where they live because of the water usage. But more importantly, it's only natural: if a data center uses as much electricity as basically the entire country, the entire town or the country of Luxembourg, right? Exactly.\n\n[00:02:31] People say to themselves, how can my rates not go up? Right. And it's, you've gotta build that infrastructure. Things like transformers, which people say, oh, who cares, you need transformers to do this work. There is a shortage of transformers right now. Right, right. The lead time on building those transformers is a year or two, maybe.\n[00:02:57] Yeah. So the whole idea that you're gonna have the world plastered with data centers in a year or two, it's not true. Even if all the money were available, it's not gonna happen.\n[00:03:09] Lee Jackson: Yeah, I don't think it will either. And it was interesting, some of the people that were so bullish at the outset, and remember this has been rolling for like three years.\n\n[00:03:22] OpenAI introduced Chat in, like, November of 2022. Yeah, so it's been rolling for three years. But again, it was rolling mostly on the idea of how AI will change everything. And it will be a profound change. It'll be more profound than perhaps the internet was 25 years ago.\n[00:03:44] But it's gonna take a lot of work. And as you and I both know, because we've been in the business so long, there were a lot of promising companies back then that are gone. Where's Netscape? Some of the other big names from 20 years ago? They're not around. There's competition in that range, but I think there's gonna be a real thinning of the herd in the next two to three years, certainly within two years, next year in 2027. I think there’ll be a big thinning of the herd and we’ll be looking at some different companies.\n\n[00:04:17] Doug McIntyre: Two years from now, there’s gonna be blood in the streets. Very, very soon. Yeah. I think so. You’re starting to see Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) product catching up with OpenAI. Is OpenAI gonna go outta business? No. No. Is it worth $500 billion? Did the last people who put the money in that final round, are they gonna get their money back?\n[00:04:37] I don't know. You've now got, it's unbelievable technology, but people are getting in too early.\n[00:04:47] Lee Jackson: Yeah. And again, they're all constantly iterating, ChatGPT came out, they have a new version five or whatever, but Gemini’s got a new one and there’s a new Claude from Anthropic.\n[00:04:59] And so, they’re not all gonna make it. They’re not all gonna make it. The question is for the betting man and the investor: who stays and who goes in the next two or three years?\n\n[00:05:10] Doug McIntyre: There’s another problem here. People don't talk enough about, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday about the fact that China has effectively unlimited electricity because of the structure of its system.\n[00:05:20] Yeah, of course. They say that their solar arrays span the mountains and that they build a nuclear plant in less time than it takes to get a permit in the United States, was one of the comments I believe. So we need to worry in the United States, and US companies in AI need to worry, about whether China is in the process of flanking us, because it isn’t just important to have great technology.\n[00:05:49] It’s important if you can have virtually unlimited data centers, I mean a data center in like every village. I'm very worried about that. Unlike a Walmart. I am very worried that the valuations of US artificial intelligence companies are going to be hit by China. Yeah. And not just by competition in the United States.\n\n[00:06:10] Lee Jackson: Yeah, I think you're right. And again, Google, they’ll be around. Oracle, they’ll be around. But I mean, the sheer amount of money they’ve already put into this is staggering. It is staggering. And the return on equity and the return on investment, it’s gonna take a lot of work. It’s gonna take a lot of work.\n[00:06:30] I mean, if I was long all of those kinds of stocks, with the exception of maybe Google, I’d trim some of it. And clearly people have already trimmed some Oracle ’cause it just exploded higher earlier this year. So there was a lot of profit taking there. And I read that Ellison lost $25 billion in like two days, or some staggering number like that.\n[00:06:51] But I wrote that story. Yeah, I wrote that. Okay. Yeah.\n\n[00:06:56] Doug McIntyre: The other thing about AI that I think investors, here's my advice to somebody: if you’ve tripled your money in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , take some off the table. Take half. Half is a great number. Don’t assume it’s gonna keep going up. Lee and I have been around long enough to see at least five or six, and I don’t mean little corrections, I mean real corrections.\n[00:07:23] Yeah. You hit that with Nvidia, it could be gone in five months. So yeah, it,\n[00:07:28] Lee Jackson: it really could. It really could. And when I was a salesman at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, I had people that made big money in Red Hat and all those names that came out then.\n[00:07:41] And I recommended JDS Uniphase, if you remember that company. I had a client that had 250,000 shares of it because he was the first US employee. I told him flat out, I said, sell half. He did, but he kept the rest of it. And it went from a hundred and a quarter to two. So I think Doug’s advice is something to be counted on.\n\n[00:08:02] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. I still like some of the utilities because, yeah, I know these guys talk about owning their own infrastructure. There was a story yesterday that there's a company that’s going to put solar arrays on satellites in outer space and then beam the energy down.\n[00:08:21] Lee Jackson: To the world. I read that too.\n[00:08:23] In fact, I have that in my notes. And I thought that was outstanding, that they can grab power out there. Well, it’s because there’s no clouds.\n[00:08:35] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. The explanation was that they like it because there aren't any clouds. Yeah.\n[00:08:39] Lee Jackson: Aether Flux is the player in space and their satellites will beam solar energy to Earth.\n[00:08:50] Right. Yes. Well, I don't know how they’re gonna do that, but that’s what they said. Don’t hold your breath. Well, anyway, I think on a final note on this, and we’ll get back to utilities soon, is: boy, be careful. And if you’ve got a huge staggering profit, take half, take half, or at least take a third.\n\n[00:09:09] Yep. I agree.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Got $10,000? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in December and Hold for the Long Term\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies in AI infrastructure.\nAlphabet has a major cost advantage over competitors.\nBoth stocks look poised to be long-term AI winners.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIf you've got $10,000 to invest and are looking for some growth stocks to hold for the long term, splitting it between a couple of top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be a good idea. This is a bit of an aggressive strategy, although AI leaders have been leading the market higher for the past few years.\nLet's look at two AI stocks to invest in now for the long term.\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king of AI infrastructure, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the primary chips used to power AI workloads. The company currently commands a more than 90% market share in the GPU space, thanks to the wide moat it has established through the ecosystem it has developed around its chips. This starts with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code was written and optimized for its chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's recent acquisition of SchedMD, which developed an open-source workload manager for AI clusters called Slurm, only helps widen its software moat. Slurm is a software platform that helps determine which GPU is assigned to which tasks and when. By acquiring SchedMD, Nvidia gains control over this important AI orchestration layer, which it can then optimize for its chips and hardware and make for a seamless experience.\nIn addition to software, Nvidia has also created an edge with its networking portfolio. Its proprietary NvLink interconnect system can transfer data between its GPUs much faster than standard PCIe connections. It pools GPU memory and boosts data throughput, essentially letting its GPUs act as one powerful unit. This optimizes large language model (LLM) training and discourages vendor mixing and matching.\n\nAs AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia is one of the companies best positioned to benefit. It has seen rapid growth, but with the AI race still just in the early innings, it has a long runway of growth still in front of it.\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is another company that is positioned to be a huge AI winner. Ironically, the reason for this is that it has been able to break free of being completely reliant on Nvidia. Alphabet has designed its own custom AI chips that are optimized to work in its Tensorflow framework. It has been using these chips to run internal workloads for more than a decade, and they are now in their seventh generation. While other companies have developed their own custom AI chips, none are as far along or as battle-tested as Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's TPUs provide a significant structural cost advantage over both cloud computing competitors and companies developing foundational LLMs, like OpenAI. As a preprogrammed ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), TPUs offer better price-performance and power efficiency, allowing Alphabet to train its Gemini models and run inference for them more cheaply than other models. It also gives its cloud computing business better margins for customers who choose to use its TPUs.\n\nGiven Alphabet's better economics, this creates a virtuous circle, as it allows it to pour more money into its chips and AI models, making them better and more attractive to customers. Alphabet also has the advantage of being able to infuse its constantly improving Gemini model throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Google search to its Android smartphone operating system to its worker productivity tools.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has huge advantages as search and generative AI discovery meld into one. Google is already the default gateway to the internet on most devices, and the company has a long-established history of monetizing search through its vast ad network.

This is the Week in Numbers. :: Week in Numbers :: $6 billion $6 billion was the value of an unusual merger between President Donald Trump's social media company and a nuclear fusion firm. It will see a tie-up between Trump Media and Google-backed TAE Technologies. It came just days after fusion industry leaders asked for more federal funding from the U.S. Energy Department. Peter Loge leads the Project on Ethics in Political Communication at The George Washington University. \"Any time a member of the president's family's name is on a commercial enterprise, it raises ethical questions. Are people buying the thing because the president's name is on it? Are people buying Trump branded products because they think it'll help him get close to the president or that the president will like them more?\" :: 80% Just over 80% of TikTok's U.S. business will be sold to avoid a ban in the country. Chinese owner ByteDance said it had signed a binding agreement with three major investors: Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The deal will build a new U.S. company called TikTok USDS Joint Venture, with ByteDance holding just under a fifth of it. :: 0.75% 0.75% is the new benchmark interest rate in Japan - up from a previous 0.5%. It's the highest number seen in three decades, and the Bank of Japan showed a readiness for further hikes. Policymakers also removed language that growth and price rises will stagnate due to higher U.S. tariffs. Which showed their belief the country is on course to hit its 2% inflation target. :: $19.5 billion $19.5 billion is the writedown taken by Ford as it does a big rethink on electric cars. The auto giant killed several models and said it would pivot to gas and hybrid models. Its move comes after demand for EVs fell in the U.S., where the Trump administration has pulled incentives for buyers. :: $108.4 billion And $108.4 billion was the hostile bid Warner Bros Discovery turned down from Paramount Skydance. Warner's board argued Paramount's offer misled shareholders over its financing. It argued the offer was 'inferior' to a merger agreement it already had in place with Netflix. Whoever wins the bidding war will get hold of popular film franchises like 'Harry Potter' and 'DC Comics'.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Warren Buffett's Last Purchase at Berkshire Hathaway a Top Stock Pick for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Alphabet is a stock Buffett regrets not investing in sooner.\nShares of the tech giant have been on a huge run since Q2 began.\nThe next year continues to look promising for Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nWarren Buffett's time as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) is unfortunately coming to a close. The legendary CEO has provided investors with incredible advice and has made some savvy investments along the way.\n\nDuring the latest round of filing Form 13F s with the SEC, it was revealed that Berkshire took a new stake in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . This shouldn't come as a surprise, as Buffett has long regretted not investing in Alphabet sooner. However, this latest stock pick has already paid off in a big way, as Alphabet's stock has risen dramatically since he took a position.\nThe question is, is it still a great stock pick for 2026?\nBuffett's trades are lagging indicators When a firm has over $100 million in assets, as Berkshire certainly does, it must file a Form 13F to disclose its holdings at the end of the quarter. This information is then made available to the public 45 days later. This means that Berkshire purchased shares of Alphabet between July 1 and Sept. 30, and depending on when they took their positions, Berkshire could be sitting on massive gains.\n\nAlphabet's stock has been on fire since July 1, and if Berkshire bought all of its Alphabet shares on that day (an unlikely proposition), it's about 75% since then. If Berkshire waited until Sept. 30 (another unlikely proposition), it's still up nearly 30%, an outstanding return in a short timeframe.\nBerkshire's Alphabet investment has been successful so far, but the problem for individual investors tracking their trades is that you cannot go back and purchase the stock at the same price that Buffett and Berkshire did. So, investors must consider whether the price to pay now is too steep compared to what Berkshire paid for it.\nAlphabet has a bright future At the start of the period when Berkshire could have bought Alphabet, the stock was trading for just over 16 times forward earnings .\nNow, it's priced at 29 times forward earnings. That's a massive difference, because it used to trade at a huge discount to the market (as measured by the S&P 500 , but now it trades at a large premium (the S&P 500 trades for 22 times forward earnings).\nSo, is Alphabet worth buying now?\n\nAlphabet had a massive run-up in that short timeframe for a few reasons. First, Alphabet received positive news in a court case surrounding the status of its crown jewel, the Google Search engine. Alphabet only had to make a few concessions in its business, which is a far cry from the breakup that the Justice Department was seeking.\n\nStory Continues\nSecond, Alphabet has emerged as a top player in the generative AI realm. It has mounted such a comeback that OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, declared a \"code red\" regarding Alphabet's Gemini model. Alphabet is clearly a top player in this area, and that dominance could make it a strong buy for the future.\n\nAlphabet's legacy businesses, advertising and cloud computing, have also put up respectable growth figures in recent quarters. In the third quarter, Google Search revenue rose 15% year over year, and Google Cloud saw a 34% growth rate. This led to overall growth of 16% for the quarter and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 35%.\nAlphabet is in a great position to have a strong 2026, so I think investors can follow Buffett's lead and scoop up Alphabet. However, your returns won't be nearly the same as Buffett's because of getting in late, versus when Buffett and Berkshire did in the second quarter.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $511,196 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,047,897 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 951 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 192% for the S&P 500.

If history is any guide, stocks will keep pushing higher: Since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, rising 1.3% on average, data compiled by Citadel Securities show.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nWhile longer-term worries about the artificial-intelligence trade linger and valuations remain stretched, optimism over a strong economy and corporate profits is keeping investor sentiment upbeat. Traders are snapping up bullish options on chipmakers and large-cap technology shares, according to Susquehanna International Group, while the retail crowd remains avid buyers of US stocks.\n“Barring any major shocks, it will be hard to fight the overwhelmingly positive seasonal period we are entering and the cleaner positioning set-up,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk team including Gail Hafif wrote in a note to clients. “While we don’t necessarily see a dramatic rally, we do think there is room to go up from here into year end.”\n\nUS stocks bounced back Thursday after a cooler-than-expected — albeit controversial — inflation report bolstered prospects for more interest-rate cuts next year. Technology shares led the advance, with the Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index rising 2% and the Nasdaq 100 Index adding 1.5% after wobbling in the past five days.\nThat’s good news for derivatives traders who spent the last few days buying options wagering on a further rally in technology shares. They scooped up call spreads tied to Nvidia Corp., Micron Technology Inc. and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), while selling puts on megacap names including Alphabet Inc., Nvidia and Broadcom Inc., according to data compiled by Susquehanna.\n“This is a classic expression of confidence that declines will be shallow and temporary,” said Chris Murphy, Susquehanna’s co-head of derivatives strategy. “Investors were using the tech drawdown to increase exposure to AI, semiconductors and long-duration tech, not flee from them.”\n\nStory Continues\nThe broader backdrop for US equities remains constructive as well. Investors have put about $100 billion into US stocks in the past nine weeks, extending a steady trend of inflows seen throughout 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. A gauge of investor sentiment tracked by the firm is sitting at the most bullish level since April.\n\nRetail investors, the stock market’s biggest cheerleaders this year, are showing few signs of losing interest. Individual traders have been net buyers of call options on US stocks for 32 of the past 33 weeks, the longest stretch in Citadel Securities’ data.\n“Following a year of strong portfolio returns and record household wealth, retail participants enter 2026 with both conviction and balance-sheet capacity to increase market participation,” Scott Rubner, head of equity and equity-derivatives strategy at Citadel Securities, wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\nInstitutional investors have become more upbeat on the stock market as well, scooping up calls across the stock market and piling into sectors outside Big Tech in the past few weeks, Rubner added. Economically sensitive real estate and industrials stocks showed the strongest buy signal for a second consecutive week, he said.\n\nSubsiding volatility ahead of a seasonally quiet part of the year is adding another tailwind. The S&P 500’s 10-day realized volatility has dropped to one of its lowest levels of the year, a dynamic that could prompt volatility-targeting and trend-following funds to increase equity exposure.\n“We still think there is room for volatility to compress further,” Goldman’s trading desk wrote. “Lower levels of implied volatility mean more fuel for systematic re-leveraging.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meanwhile, the threat of competition from deep-pocketed heavyweights and upstarts like OpenAI and Anthropic weighed on software makers that are considered most at risk from challengers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nWith the bull market in US stocks stretching into a fourth year, there are more concerns than ever about the sustainability of heavy spending on AI computing and whether the returns will justify the investments.\n“There’s a lot of optimism around AI, but also a lot of hype,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. “2026 will be more about the proof of AI. What’s the ROI on the hyperscalers that have been spending? Will they see profit growth continue to accelerate?”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the biggest stock market stories for the tech industry in 2025 and the outlook for each in the new year.\nNeocloud Nerves\nNeoclouds, which are companies that provide cloud-computing services tailored to AI customers, were the rage for most of 2025. But heading into 2026 they look more like proxies for AI bubble risk.\nGrowing scrutiny over OpenAI’s lack of profitability has raised questions about its ability to pay for its massive spending commitments, including a cloud-computing deal with Oracle Corp. said to be worth $300 billion over five years. Oracle was expected to be a major beneficiary of AI growth, but its stock is down 45% since hitting a peak in September as its exposure to OpenAI becomes a major concern.\n“There is a lot of fear with OpenAI and the commitments it has made,” said Adam Rich, who helps oversee more than $17 billion in assets as deputy chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Vaughan Nelson. “People can only forecast what we know, and right now there’s a lot we don’t know. So long as that’s the case, it will be hard for companies like Oracle to regain their luster.”\n\nStory Continues\nOracle has other issues, including the amount of money it’s spending on data center leases, reported delays in some data center projects, and financing questions. Its growing debt load is particularly concerning to investors, as a measure of the company’s credit risk has skyrocketed to its highest level since the financial crisis.\n\nBeyond Oracle, neocloud provider CoreWeave Inc. has lost about two-thirds of its market value since hitting a high in June. And Nebius Group NV shares are down more than 42% from an October peak.\nBoring Tech\nInvestors discovered new AI trades in 2025 by following where the billions of dollars in pledged capital expenditures are going. You can see it just by looking at the top performers in the S&P 500 Index. Memory and storage company Sandisk Corp. leads the list, followed by Western Digital Corp, which makes hard disk drives, and its rival Seagate Technology Holdings Plc. Micron Technology Inc., the biggest US-based maker of memory chips, is fifth.\nThe trend is expected to continue in 2026 as capital expenditures keep growing. Investors are increasingly thinking about where the next wave is headed, with some eyeing beaten-down software stocks.\n“Things at the edge are interesting,” said Melissa Otto, who heads technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “There is this AI ecosystem that orbits around the AI infrastructure itself.”\n\nSoftware Slump\nSoftware stocks traded at attractive market valuations in 2025, but that did little to entice investors. Shares of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies were hit particularly hard. Much of the weakness reflects growing fears that the group will be disrupted by AI, as offerings from services like ChatGPT and Alphabet’s Gemini cut into demand or pricing power.\nAI represents “existential competition” for some software companies as “AI chatbot and agent dominance becomes the core battlefield,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note this week.\nCompanies like ServiceNow Inc., Adobe Inc., and Salesforce Inc. were among the weakest performers in the tech sector this year. A Morgan Stanley index of SaaS companies is down 10%, compared with a gain of 5% for a broader software index that includes perceived AI winners like Microsoft Corp.\nWhether software’s underperformance continues will be a key stock market theme in 2026. Some Wall Street pros already think it’s overdone. The SaaS group “is trading anywhere between a 30-40% discount relative to what its fundamentals would suggest,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month.\n\nPricey Got Pricier\nConcerns that nose-bleed valuations would hamper the ascent of some of 2024’s hottest stocks in 2025 proved misplaced. Palantir Technologies Inc. turned out to be one of the year’s best performers despite trading at more than 200 times estimated profits for much of the year. The stock’s 146% advance ranks eighth in the S&P 500.\nWall Street has long been skeptical of Palantir, mainly because of the stock’s lofty valuation. Of the 29 the analysts covering the maker of data analysis software, just nine rate the stock a buy. Still, the company is expected to expand at an enviable clip, with revenue projected to jump 43% in 2026 and 39% in 2027, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nElectric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. also overcame concerns about its valuation, which is by far the most expensive among the so-called Magnificent Seven. The stock hit a record this week despite trading at more than 200 times anticipated profits and facing a number of headwinds from slowing EV sales to concerns about safety.\n\nInvestors are optimistic about Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s vision of a self-driving car future and nascent push into robotics. After two years of stagnant revenue growth, Tesla’s sales are expected to expand 13% in 2026 and 19% in 2027.\nAll of which leaves the tech landscape heading into 2026 roughly where it was a year ago. Yes, the stocks are pricey. But the opportunities for growth are there. It’s up to the companies to deliver.\n“Expectations are high and valuations are expensive,” Ameriprise’s Saglimbene said. “That means they have more to prove, and they will really have to exceed expectations to move higher.”\n--With assistance from Phil Serafino.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Is Selling Nvidia and Buying This Other Magnificent Chip Stock Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:52 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Philippe Laffont founded the hedge fund Coatue Management.\nCoatue's largest positions are in leading artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\nLast quarter, Coatue trimmed its exposure to Nvidia and rotated profits into Alphabet stock.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAbout halfway through every quarter, any institutional investment fund that manages more than $100 million is required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), documenting all the stocks that it bought and sold during the prior quarter.\n\nOne such firm that I monitor closely is Coatue Management, founded by Philippe Laffont. During the third quarter, Coatue reduced its position in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by 14% -- selling 1.6 million shares. At the same time, Laffont increased the fund's stake in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) by 259% -- acquiring 5.2 million shares.\nLet's explore what may have motivated these moves and assess if now would be a good time to follow Laffont's lead.\nIs selling Nvidia stock right now a good idea? When OpenAI released ChatGPT to the general public in November 2022, Nvidia's market capitalization was roughly $345 billion. Today, the company is worth $4.3 trillion -- making the chip designer the world's most valuable company.\nAccording to Coatue's filings, the firm has held some exposure to Nvidia stock since 2016. Given Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last few years, taking some gains from a winning long-term position off the table seems reasonable.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia remains the eighth-largest position in Laffont's portfolio -- alongside other AI leaders such as Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Amazon , and Broadcom .\nIn my view, Laffont is employing prudent financial judgment by modestly reducing Coatue's allocation to Nvidia and rotating some capital into other growth opportunities.\nWhy might Laffont like Alphabet stock? Alphabet's trajectory throughout the AI revolution has been almost the opposite of Nvidia's. Following the release of ChatGPT, many on Wall Street started sounding the alarm that the rise of large language models (LLMs) and chatbots could spell the end of traditional internet search engines.\n\nThe bear thesis was real: Chatbots were expected to eat Google's lunch, and Alphabet was facing an existential crisis. It seems like the only people who didn't buy into this doomsday scenario were the executives in charge at Alphabet.\nOver the last three years, the company has quietly made significant progress across a number of different areas within the AI realm:\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet released its own LLM, called Gemini, which is now a fixture on the Google search homepage.\nBeyond its core advertising business, Alphabet has done a stellar job growing its cloud infrastructure business -- Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP has inked a number of high-profile deals with major players including OpenAI and Meta, proving it can compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, which have larger shares of the cloud market.\nAlphabet is also a strategic investor in OpenAI's top rival, Anthropic. As part of their relationship, Anthropic is using Google Cloud to meet some of its computing power needs. Their deal includes access to Alphabet's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\nLastly, Alphabet is one of the leaders in the autonomous driving space; its Waymo self-driving taxi service is operating in several U.S. cities.\n\nI think the biggest selling point for Alphabet is its vertically integrated business model. The company's various assets in search (Google), streaming video (YouTube), consumer electronics (Android), cloud computing (GCP), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), and now custom hardware (TPUs) all share a common thread: artificial intelligence.\nLaffont may be hedging his portfolio away from pure-play semiconductor and data center businesses while seeking exposure to broader pockets of the ongoing AI infrastructure movement.\nIs Alphabet stock a good buy right now? Among the cloud hyperscalers, Alphabet's stock is still the cheapest by forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, though it has in recent months climbed back to near parity with Microsoft.\nThe caveat from the analysis above is that Alphabet has clearly experienced a meaningful valuation expansion over the last couple of months, while the valuations of Amazon and Microsoft have both compressed a bit.\nI think there are two primary factors driving the increased buying.\nFirst, Laffont isn't the only big-name investor betting on Alphabet stock. Warren Buffett also initiated a position in Alphabet last quarter. In addition, a growing number of technologists are beginning to propose that application-specific integrated circuits -- including Google's TPUs -- could pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator realm.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors have flocked to Alphabet, which was trading at reasonable valuations relative to its megacap tech peers. While I think Alphabet remains a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity, there are a couple of important points to think about before jumping into the stock.\nAfter its recent run, Alphabet stock is no longer such a bargain. Moreover, the bull thesis around its opportunity in the chip landscape is currently somewhat theoretical.\nNevertheless, I think following Laffont's lead here could prove wise. If you've owned Nvidia stock throughout the AI revolution, then odds are you're sitting on a nice gain. It might not be a bad choice to take some profits and buy into other emerging players such as Alphabet as the AI infrastructure buildout continues to accelerate.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Trump Media merger with nuclear fusion firm raises questions: analyst\n\nReuters Videos\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:25 PM PST\n\nIn this video: TATE.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nSTORY: On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump’s social media company announced an unusual $6 billion merger with TAE Technologies, a Google-backed nuclear fusion firm. The news that Trump Media, which operates Truth Social, was getting into the nuclear energy business... ...came just days after fusion industry leaders met with representatives of the U.S. Energy Department asking for more federal funding. And that rings some alarm bells says Peter Loge - a professor who heads up the Project on Ethics in Political Communication at The George Washington University. “Any time the president's name is on a commercial enterprise, it raises ethical questions. Any time a member of the president's family's name is on a commercial enterprise, it raises ethical questions. Are people buying the thing because the president's name is on it? Are people buying Trump branded products because they think it'll help him get close to the president or that the president will like them more?\" The growing electricity needs of the technology industry have revived interest in nuclear power. However, despite decades of efforts, nuclear fusion, often seen as a potentially cleaner and more reliable energy source, has yet to produce a commercially viable reactor. The chief executive of TAE, Michl Binderbauer, was among the leaders who met U.S. Energy officials after the department formed its first-ever fusion office. “And the question then becomes, 'Are they going to have a leg up? Is this company going to have a leg up because it is owned in part by a member of the Trump family? You know, will this company have an unfair competitive advantage when working with the federal government, when trying to get investors on board, because it is very publicly affiliated with with President Trump and his family.” After his return to office this year, Trump's close relatives have pursued ventures leveraging his political power and policy shifts. For instance, the Trump family has piled up billions in crypto-related wealth as the president throws his support behind digital financial assets. Greater support from the federal government could potentially boost the value of the fusion investment as well. Trump has 114 million shares in Trump Media, roughly 40% of the company. In the new merger, his ownership stake would be roughly 20%. Trump Media mainly generates ad revenue off of Truth Social and has consistently lost money since it began. Loge says one option is for the president to remove his name from the companies to avoid looking improper. \"Of course, what the president is doing might be completely on the up and up. But we're at a point in our history where we need to both do and be seen to be doing the most noble thing possible. The most noble thing possible here is probably taking your name off of companies that are going to benefit from or even rely on the federal government..\" Trump Media chief executive Devin Nunes, a former Republican member of Congress, will be co-CEO of the new company, along with TAE chief Binderbauer. The two, along with Donald Trump Jr., will sit on the merged company's board.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Down 60%, Should You Buy the Dip on QUBT Stock?\n\nJeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QUBT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Quantum computing stocks have pulled back in recent months on concerns about an AI bubble.\nQuantum Computing Inc. is the smallest of the major quantum computing stocks.\nThere have not been any insider purchases of the stock this year.\n10 stocks we like better than Quantum Computing ›\nQuantum computing stocks have been one of the biggest surprises of 2025.\n\nThe emerging industry, which was virtually unheard of a little more than a year ago, began to gain steam after President Trump was elected, and surged last December when Google announced a breakthrough with its quantum chip, Willow.\nOn the heels of the AI boom, which has driven hundreds of billions of spending on capital expenditures on data centers and chips and added trillions in market value, investors are hopeful that quantum computing could be the next transformative technology.\nQuantum computing is still in its infancy, but the technology has a lot of potential. One of the quantum stocks that has gotten attention from investors this year is Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT) , also known as QCi. As you can see, it's been a rocky year for QCi, and the stock is now down 38%, which includes an early sell-off in the year as the sector gave up some of the gains from Google's Willow announcement.\nQCi is the smallest of the four major quantum computing stocks, and it currently has a market cap of $2.3 billion. However, Quantum Computing Inc. still isn't generating material revenue as it only had revenue of $546,000 over its last four quarters, and $384,000 in the third quarter.\nAfter the pullback following its peak in early October, QCi is now down 60% from its high. Is this a buying opportunity for the quantum stock or a warning sign that it could fall further? Let's explore.\nWhat you need to know about Quantum Computing Inc. With less than $1 million in revenue over the last four quarters, QCi is still a development-stage company.\nThere are a lot of different ways quantum computing is being applied by the different quantum computing companies. QCi's specialty is photonics, or fabricating photonic computing engines using thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN).\n\nThe company opened its photonic chip foundry in Arizona, known as Fab 1, in February, and it's aiming to build a second, larger facility. It's also making progress in commercialization, having received a purchase order from a top 5 U.S. bank for its quantum security solutions. It also took a step forward with its collaboration with NASA.\nQCi looks adequately capitalized at the moment with $352.4 million and no debt, and its operating expenses are modest, at $28.9 million through the first three quarters.\n\nLire la suite\nThe company aims to scale up to industrial-scale manufacturing production, and named Yuping Huang as its permanent CEO after he joined as interim chief in April. Management hasn't given guidance for its production ramp or a revenue target, but Wall Street expects the company to reach revenue of $2.8 million in 2026, more than tripling from 2025.\n\nWhy investors may want to be cautious While Quantum Computing Inc. appears to be making progress toward its goals, there are some reasons to be skeptical of the stock.\nFirst, it trades at a sky-high price-to-sales multiple of more than 2,000, and it looks like it will take years of growth before that ratio starts to look reasonable.\nSecond, the investors who know the company best, the management team, have been busy selling the stock this year, perhaps taking advantage of the surge that took place late last year. In fact, there have been no insider buys. Insiders have sold more than 2 million shares of QCi this year. That's only about 1% of shares outstanding, but these insiders understand the company better than anyone else, considering the technical and difficult-to-understand nature of quantum computing. The gap in understanding the business between management and retail investors is unusually large. It seems notable then that there was no insider purchasing of the stock.\n\nIs Quantum Computing Inc. a buy? Concerns about an AI bubble have pushed the whole quantum computing sector lower since its peak in early October, and that response seems fair.\nIt's still very early with this technology, and the emergence of AI may have led to exaggerated hopes for quantum computing. Quantum Computing Inc. could eventually scale to a meaningful size, but that's likely to take years.\n\nAt this point, investors are better off on the sidelines, waiting for more clarity from the business or a better entry point. Even as QCi has fallen 60% from its peak, it can still go a lot lower from here.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Quantum Computing right now? Before you buy stock in Quantum Computing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Quantum Computing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company May Now Be Winning the AI War\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:52 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After ChatGPT took some of its search traffic, Alphabet rebounded by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode.\nAlphabet's Gemini 3 is considered a leading LLM.\nManagement will increase the tech giant's capital expenditures in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIt's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world in significant ways, and the major hyperscalers are all investing hundreds of billions of dollars in their efforts to capitalize on the trend. Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Does Philippe Laffont Know Something Wall Street Doesn't? The Billionaire Investor Just Sold Nvidia and AMD, and Bought These Other Chip Stocks Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points During the third quarter, Coatue Management reduced its exposure to GPU leaders Nvidia and AMD.\nAt the same time, the firm dramatically increased its stakes in Alphabet and Marvell Technology.\nPhilippe Laffont is making sure his fund has positions across the entire semiconductor landscape.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWithin 45 days of the end of each quarter, every institutional investor managing over $100 million is required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings itemize which stocks they bought and sold during that quarter. This provides everyday investors with a glimpse -- though a delayed one -- into what the \"smart money\" on Wall Street is doing.\nDuring the third quarter, Philippe Laffont's firm, Coatue Management, made a number of interesting moves. It trimmed its exposure in semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) by 14% and 19%, respectively. In addition, Laffont more than tripled the fund's stakes in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) .\nLet's break down what may have influenced these decisions and assess if Laffont could be onto something big.\nNvidia and AMD dominate the AI chip market Nvidia and AMD are the two leading designers of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most widely used parallel processing chips for training large language models and building generative AI applications.\nThe rise of generative AI has ushered in a wave of unprecedented revenue and profit growth for chip designers. Shares of Nvidia and AMD have skyrocketed by nearly 900% and 200%, respectively, throughout the AI revolution.\nManagement consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that investment in AI infrastructure will reach nearly $7 trillion over the next five years -- with the majority of that spending allocated toward building data centers and chip procurement.\nWith that in mind, it seems likely that the hyperscalers will continue accelerating their AI capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Given these secular tailwinds, the prospects surrounding Nvidia and AMD appear bright.\n\nThis begs the question: Does Laffont see something the rest of us don't?\nUnderstanding Alphabet and Marvell's positions in the chip market One of the biggest catalysts for Alphabet right now is its cloud infrastructure business. Google Cloud has attracted a number of high-profile customers, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms .\nMoreover, the company's custom-designed AI processors -- which it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- are becoming a key part of the value proposition around its AI ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile GPUs and other specialized parallel processors get most of the attention among AI investors, there's a lot more that goes into a data center. Marvell can provide much of it: The company specializes in designing architecture for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) computing stacks, as well as other networking, security, and storage hardware.\nAs AI workloads become larger and more sophisticated -- requiring enhanced memory and storage processes -- demand for the offerings of players like Marvell should rise further.\nThe bottom line: The semiconductor opportunity is broadening While analysts appear optimistic about Alphabet's TPU business, these chips are heavily geared toward custom applications such as deep learning. Meanwhile, Marvell is carving out its own pocket in the AI realm focused on data centers' memory storage needs.\nIn my view, Laffont's moves during the third quarter look more like a structural mix shift than a reflection of souring sentiment toward AI GPUs. What I mean by that is the billionaire smartly reduced his fund's exposure to general-purpose chip designers such as Nvidia and AMD and rotated capital into other specific segments of the AI space.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a broader point: Laffont still has significant exposure to the GPU market. It's not as if Coatue completely dumped its stakes in Nvidia and AMD.\nDuring the third quarter, he merely increased his bets on other areas of the chip market beyond generic accelerators. The construction of Coatue's portfolio suggests the firm is quite bullish about the continuing expansion of AI infrastructure. It appears that Laffont is trying to capitalize on this trend by building a diversified portfolio around the proliferation of chips and their various applications in AI.\nAt the end of the day, I think building positions in the major players across GPUs, custom chipsets, memory architecture, and more will prove to be a winning investment strategy in the long run.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

See the full list for free.\nAlphabet Investment Narrative Recap To own Alphabet, you have to believe its AI heavyweights Gemini and Google Cloud can more than offset rising capital spending and its reliance on ad dollars. The latest clean energy and carbon removal deals help de risk the power needs behind that AI build out, but they do not change the near term swing factor, which remains how quickly AI features in Search and Cloud translate into higher revenue versus mounting infrastructure costs.\n\nThe 21 year renewable power agreement with TotalEnergies in Malaysia, alongside the separate 30 megawatt solar deal in Kedah, is directly tied to Alphabet’s AI and cloud capacity expansion in Asia. These contracts matter because they underpin long lived data center investments that support Google Cloud’s AI backlog and Gemini adoption, both central to the current growth catalyst, while reinforcing that AI driven capex will stay elevated for years.\nYet even with AI momentum, investors should be aware that rising capex could squeeze margins if revenue growth slows...\nRead the full narrative on Alphabet (it's free!)\nAlphabet's narrative projects $512.6 billion revenue and $148.4 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 11.3% yearly revenue growth and roughly a $32.8 billion earnings increase from $115.6 billion today.\n\nUncover how Alphabet's forecasts yield a $323.70 fair value , a 9% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Across 191 fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community, views on Alphabet range widely from US$171 to US$340 per share.

      "Content": "Meta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n\nLuke Juricic\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:49 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is readying a technological offensive for 2026, developing a suite of next-generation artificial intelligence models designed to challenge the dominance of OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.\nAccording to the Thursday report from WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter, the social media giant is working on a high-stakes image and video-focused AI model code-named \"Mango.\" Concurrently, the company is developing \"Avocado,\" its next major text-based large language model (LLM).\n\nThe new roadmap was reportedly detailed during an internal Q&A on Thursday featuring Meta’s Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox. The models are expected to release in the first half of 2026, signaling a long-term play to move beyond the incremental updates of the current Llama family.\nThe development of Mango and Avocado represents the first major output from Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a specialized division created after a major restructuring this past summer. To lead the group, CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally orchestrated high-profile recruiting efforts, poaching more than 20 researchers from OpenAI and hiring Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, to oversee the effort.\nThe move underscores Zuckerberg’s willingness to spend aggressively to close the gap with rivals. As part of the transition, Meta reportedly invested over $14 billion to acquire a near-majority stake in Scale AI, cementing Wang’s role as the primary architect of Meta’s post-Llama strategy.\n\nDuring the internal session, Wang emphasized that Avocado will focus heavily on advanced coding capabilities, a traditional weak point for previous Meta models compared to competitors.\nMore ambitiously, Wang noted that Meta is in the early stages of developing \"world models.\" Unlike current LLMs that predict the next word in a sequence, world models aim to understand physical reality by processing vast amounts of visual information.\nMeta stock remained relatively flat in after-hours trade following the WSJ report, though shares rose 2.3% during trading hours.\nRelated articles\nMeta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Michael Burry Asks For Photos Of Warehoused Nvidia GPUs After Analyst Questions Jensen Huang's Blackwell Shipment Numbers (UPDATED)\n\nAnanya Gairola\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nGM\n\n^IXIC\n\nEditor’s Note: This story has been updated to provide additional clarity on Nvidia GPU dies shipped in 2025.\nOver the weekend, Michael Burry , the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" for forecasting the 2008 housing collapse, asked for evidence of stockpiled Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPUs.\n\nThis development came after an analysis on X questioned whether Jensen Huang's statement about Blackwell shipments aligns with the company's reported revenue and U.S. data-center capacity.\nBurry Joins Debate Over Nvidia's Blackwell Shipments Burry's statement came after a detailed thread on X from a user known as Kakashii ignited fresh scrutiny around Nvidia's latest GPU generation.\nThe user, who introduced themselves as an attorney on social media, questioned Huang's statement that six million Blackwell GPUs have already shipped.\n\nHuang said in October 2025 that demand for Nvidia's chips is still surging, noting that the company has shipped 6 million Blackwell GPUs over the past four quarters, reported CNBC.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAt the time, he also stated that Nvidia expects a combined $500 billion in GPU sales across the Blackwell line and next year's Rubin generation.\nAccording to the analysis shared by Kakashii on X, Nvidia's reported $111 billion in data-center revenue since Blackwell launched does not appear to support that shipment volume.\nEven after factoring in the more than $10 billion Nvidia disclosed in the 2024 fourth-quarter Blackwell revenue, the thread argues the numbers only account for roughly 4 million units, leaving a potential gap of hundreds of thousands to millions of GPUs.\n\nPower and Data-Center Capacity Add Another Layer Of Questions The thread also pointed to the enormous energy requirements of running Blackwell chips.\nIf 6 million GPUs shipped and 65% to 70% were deployed in U.S. data centers, they would require 8.5 to 11 gigawatts of power — roughly equivalent to the electricity capacity of Singapore, the analyst said.\nHowever, the U.S. only added an estimated 8.5 gigawatts of data-center-usable capacity between 2024 and 2025, the user noted. That assumes every new facility uses only Nvidia hardware and no Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) or Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google chips.\nEven then, the user argued, the power supply barely matches the stated GPU shipment volume.\n\nStory Continues\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nBurry Calls For Receipts: ‘Calling For Pics And Proof' Sharing the thread, Burry urged X users to send him photos or proof of Nvidia GPUs being stored \"in mass quantities\" in the U.S. or overseas.\n\"Some have reached out to me,\" he wrote, adding, \"it is getting interesting. But I need more.\"\nNotably, the bar chart shown at Nvidia's GTC DC in October reflected 6 million GPU dies shipped in calendar year 2025.\nA footnote on the slide noted that the Blackwell and Rubin architectures use two GPU dies per chip. As a result, while 6 million GPU dies were shipped, the total came to 3 million complete GPU packages.\n\nDespite Nvidia's Pushback, Burry Says His Bearish Thesis Still Holds Up Last month, Burry doubled down on his bearish view of Nvidia, reaffirming his analysis on X just hours after the company privately pushed back his past claims. Burry argues the company's $112.5 billion in buybacks added no real shareholder value and only offset stock-based compensation.\nMeanwhile, analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo defended Nvidia, saying concerns about rising Days Sales Outstanding and inventory levels misunderstand the company's sales patterns and preparation for new Blackwell chips.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged 31.88% so far this year, outperforming both the Nasdaq Composite's 22.29% gain and the Nasdaq 100's 22.49% rise.

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The AI chip conversation begins with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , the company that has dominated this market from the jump.\nHowever, tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has emerged as a potential competitor after successfully training its AI models with custom-built TPU chips it designed in-house.\nWhich AI chip stock is the better buy heading into 2026?\nNvidia's AI dominance creates a high ceiling, but a lower floor Thus far, developing AI has required massive quantities of chips.

Some experts believe Nvidia's market share in the data center GPU chip space is as high as 92%.\nAs long as hyperscalers continue to build out this infrastructure, it's hard to see Nvidia's business slowing down anytime soon. In fact, Nvidia announced that it has booked $500 billion in orders for its Blackwell chips and their looming successor, Rubin, through the end of next year, with $150 billion of that already delivered.\n\nThis data center boom has been highly lucrative. Nvidia now has deep pockets to develop and prepare for emerging AI opportunities outside of data centers, such as autonomous vehicles and humanoid robotics. That said, data center chip sales have become nearly the entirety of Nvidia's business. If data center investments dry up, Nvidia would struggle to fill those holes, and the stock would likely collapse.\nAlphabet's AI ecosystem makes it the safer bet For as much money pouring into AI data centers as there is, the group of companies cutting the checks, the AI hyperscalers, is relatively small. Among them is Google's parent company, Alphabet. Rather than relying on Nvidia's chips to power its AI models, Alphabet has worked diligently to develop its own custom-built tensor processing units, or TPUs, designed specifically for Google Cloud's machine learning workloads.\n\nStory continues\nAlphabet successfully trained its newest Gemini model on its TPUs. It went so well that the company is considering selling its TPUs to other AI hyperscalers, such as Meta Platforms . Alphabet probably won't challenge Nvidia's market leadership, but the TPU represents additional upside to Alphabet's complete AI ecosystem. It's icing on an already delicious cake.\n\nThe stock already has a high floor due to its lucrative advertising and cloud computing business segments. Even if Alphabet never sells its TPUs to another company, they still provide a crucial cost benefit, saving Alphabet from spending billions of dollars on third-party chips. At this point, it appears that Alphabet has a significantly higher floor than Nvidia.\nThe winner? It depends Does that make Alphabet the better buy? Well, it sort of depends on the style of investor you are. If you want maximum upside, it's hard to beat Nvidia, which has proven to possess the foresight needed to dominate the AI opportunity from the beginning. Even if other companies begin encroaching on the data center market, Nvidia will likely remain a key player in the AI field, including future applications.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a business that is a bit more diversified and stable, Alphabet may be a better fit for you. The company has multiple established business units and still offers exposure to new industries, like autonomous driving and quantum computing, through its smaller divisions.\nThe good news? Both stocks trade at attractive valuations, based on the market's expectations for their future earnings growth.\nA higher anticipated growth rate accompanies Nvidia's higher price-to-earnings ratio, though things can change quickly if the AI investment cycle ends prematurely.\nUltimately, it's hard to go wrong with either company as a buy-and-hold AI investment for 2026 and beyond.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "4 Companies Are Betting on AI Security. Here’s Who’s Best Positioned.\n\nWilliam Temple\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 1:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ARLO\n\nADT\n\nGOOG\n\nREZI\n\nQuick Read Google’s stock gained 60% year-to-date versus ADT’s 21%, suggesting markets favor AI providers over monitoring operators.\nADT generates $1.10B from recurring monitoring with 25.7% operating margins. Arlo’s $510M revenue produces only 0.84% profit margins.\nADT’s 24.7% earnings growth outpaces 4.4% revenue growth, indicating AI improves profitability more than expansion.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe smart home security market is undergoing a fundamental shift as AI moves from buzzword to business driver. We analyzed four players to determine who actually benefits from the AI security trend.\nThe Four Contenders ADT: The Monitoring Leader ADT ( NYSE:ADT ) operates the traditional model: 6.5 million customers paying monthly fees for 24/7 professional monitoring. The company generates $5.11 billion in annual revenue, with $1.10 billion from recurring monitoring subscriptions. Their strategic bet centers on the ADT+ platform, integrating AI capabilities through a partnership with Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ).\n\nResideo Technologies: The Hardware Play Resideo Technologies ( NYSE:REZI ) brings Honeywell Home, First Alert, and Control4 brands to 150 million spaces worldwide. They focus on HVAC controls, smoke detection, and home safety equipment. Revenue reaches $7.44 billion annually, but they sell hardware and controls rather than monitoring services.\n\nArlo Technologies: The Camera Specialist Arlo Technologies ( NASDAQ:ARLO ) takes a pure-play approach to security cameras with Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity. Based in San Jose, they generate $510 million in annual revenue from camera sales and optional cloud storage subscriptions.\nGoogle: The AI Partner Google enters as both competitor and collaborator. Their Nest product line competes directly in smart home hardware, while their ADT partnership provides AI capabilities to the monitoring leader. This is of course a rounding error for Google's massive business outside of this zone, but you should look at them as a player getting a foothold in yet another industry, rather than a pureplay like others.\n\nHow the Business Models Compare Revenue stability separates these players. ADT's monitoring business produces predictable monthly income with 25.7% operating margins. Customers typically stay for years, creating a durable revenue stream that generated $2.66 billion in EBITDA over the past twelve months.\nResideo operates a fundamentally different model. They manufacture and distribute products through retail and contractor channels. While revenue is larger at $7.44 billion, operating margins of 8.42% reflect the lower-margin hardware business. The company reports a profit margin of negative 8.61%, indicating structural challenges.\n\nStory Continues\nArlo faces the toughest economics. Their $510 million in revenue produces just $4.28 million in net income, translating to a 0.84% profit margin. The standalone camera business lacks the recurring revenue that makes monitoring services valuable.\nGoogle's position is unique. The partnership allows Google to monetize AI technology through ADT's installed base without bearing the costs of operating a monitoring network.\n\nWhat Management Is Saying ADT CEO Jim DeVries emphasized execution in the Q3 2025 call: \"ADT again delivered solid revenue growth, robust cash flow, and very strong earnings per share in the third quarter, reflecting the resilience of our business model and our team's execution of our strategy.\"\nThe company completed a $1 billion refinancing of senior secured notes and bought back $112 million in shares during Q3. These are moves of a mature business optimizing capital structure, not a company betting aggressively on AI disruption.\n\nAnalysts remain divided. Morgan Stanley lowered their price target from $9.50 to $9.00, maintaining an equal weight rating. Citigroup raised their target to $10 with a buy rating. The disagreement centers on growth: analysts project 12% earnings growth for ADT in 2026, below the market's 16% average.\nWho Actually Benefits Most As with many industries, the evidence points to Google as the primary beneficiary. Google gains distribution through ADT's customer base without operational costs or customer acquisition expenses.\nADT benefits secondarily through improved margins and customer retention. Their 24.7% earnings growth outpaces 4.4% revenue growth, indicating AI helps profitability more than top-line expansion. The company secured a major partnership with D.R. Horton, the nation's largest homebuilder, to install ADT systems in new homes.\n\nResideo and Arlo face structural disadvantages. Neither possesses the recurring revenue model that makes AI investment economically viable at scale. Resideo's negative profitability and Arlo's razor-thin margins suggest their business models struggle even before accounting for AI development costs.\nThe Bottom Line Google captures the most value from AI-enhanced home security through its ADT partnership and Nest products. ADT benefits from operational improvements but faces skepticism about growth acceleration. Traditional hardware players lack the business model to compete effectively in an AI-driven market.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "ChatGPT’s mobile app hits new milestone of $3B in consumer spending\n\nSarah Perez\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:50 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: XAAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nChatGPT has hit a new milestone of $3 billion in worldwide consumer spending on mobile as of this week, according to estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures . This figure represents the total spending on iOS and Android devices since the app’s launch in May 2023, when it first arrived, then only on iOS.\nWhat’s notable is that the bulk of that spending took place this year. Worldwide, consumers spent an estimated $2.48 billion in the ChatGPT mobile app in 2025, representing a 408% year-over-year increase from the $487 million spent in 2024. In 2023, the app’s first year of availability, it earned $42.9 million, before growing 1,036% to reach the 2024 figure.\nThese numbers represent a sharp rise in consumer adoption, compared with other popular apps. For instance, it took ChatGPT 31 months to reach $3 billion in consumer spending, but the top earner, TikTok, took 58 months to do so, Appfigures told TechCrunch.\nChatGPT also reached the milestone faster than top streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max, which hit the $3 billion figure in 42 months and 46 months, respectively.\nxAI’s Grok, however, is seeing a similar revenue trajectory to ChatGPT, compared with other AI rivals.\nGrok was released in late 2023 to X Premium Plus subscribers before becoming more broadly available last year. But if you compare the pace of consumer spending across AI apps, Grok came the closest to matching ChatGPT’s cumulative revenue at the same point, once it began monetizing. (You can see this on the chart below, which plots the AI apps’ spending aligned to when each app began monetizing.)\nWhile the $3 billion in spending represents a significant uptake by consumers, it’s not the only way to measure AI app adoption or potential long-term revenue.\nChatGPT’s mobile customers are buying paid subscriptions, like the $20 per month ChatGPT Plus or the $200 per month ChatGPT Pro for advanced users. But AI apps can generate revenue in other ways, including through developer offerings and, perhaps soon for ChatGPT , ads. In addition, ChatGPT on Wednesday launched its own app store of sorts, which the company suggests will be monetized in some way in the future, its blog post noted .\nGoogle, meanwhile, is exploring the potential to transition its healthy search ads business to AI-powered search, placing ads in AI Mode , AI Overviews , AI shopping , and an increasingly AI-powered Discover page , among other things.\nAnthropic is aiming at the business market and is reportedly on track for $70 billion in revenue by 2028.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What it takes to construct an AI data center, Hut 8 CEO outlines\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:50 AM PST\n\nIn this video: GOOG\n\nOWL\n\nORCL\n\nHUT\n\nHut 8 Corp. ( HUT ) unveiled its own partnership with Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Fluidstack to build an AI data center in Louisiana. Alphabet's Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) is providing the backstop on this latter deal.\nHut 8 CEO Asher Genoot joins Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to further discuss the logistics behind constructing the data center, designing the systems inside the facility, and Google's credit history that ultimately enabled this deal.\nAlso watch Asher Genoot explain some of the details of the data center deal and Google's invaluable role in securing it.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nI'm sure you've seen these stories recently, Azure of the difficulty building AI infrastructure, building out these data centers. You know, Core Weve stock has gotten absolutely hammered the past six weeks because of delays in building out their sites. What, how hard is it to bring these sites to life and what challenges do you anticipate over the next year?\n00:23 Speaker B\nSo there's two things there. One is expectation management. We actually have told the customer we're going to deliver the data center, start delivering the first data hall in Q2 of 2027. That gives us ample runway and a conservative delivery schedule to make sure that we're able to push to deliver on time, rather than be crunched on a schedule that's really tight already. And second, it's all about do you have the local labor? Do you have the general contracting? Because there are so many of these data centers being built, are there the people to actually build and manage these?\n01:00 Speaker B\nSo with Jacob's Engineering as a design and engineering firm, we have an engineering group and we have a construction group. Then local contractors like MMR, Cajun, Turner, these are all local contractors on electrical, civil, mechanical in the state of Louisiana that have already committed to our facility and the manpower required to build this site. Then what goes into the data center? It's the actual supply chain. Verve is our partner on from a supply chain perspective, delivering long lead time items.\n01:40 Speaker B\nMany of those we're actually going to skid so we can actually do a lot of the manufacturing and the uh assembly offsite. And so when we bring it on site, it's a faster execution and deployment as well. So I think giving customers more conservative schedules, meanwhile bringing together a group of partners that have already committed to those expectations is critical. And that's why it took us a little bit longer to announce this deal because if we just announced a customer deal, that would have been great, we would have to figure out how to actually deliver after signing the contract.\n02:19 Speaker B\nHere, we signed all of these commitments at the same time and so we're not only delivering a commitment to the customer, but we have commitments from all of our partners that they are going to deliver on that same commitment.\n02:35 Speaker A\nSo the market rewarding Hut 8, uh also a couple of your competitors, but on the other side of the spectrum, you have the market worried about a company like Oracle and Blue Owl Capital and perhaps Oracle having too much debt and Blue Owl Capital not supporting their initiatives. Is the market right to have those debt fears?\n03:04 Speaker B\nThere's a lot of dollars being deployed into infrastructure today. And at the end of the day, these are long-term commitments. For us, we had multiple customers that we were negotiating, dealing with and working with, and credit is so important. Is this a customer that in all scenarios, AI strong, AI weaker, but in all scenarios will pay on their lease obligations. And that's why having this Google backstop and this financial backstop on all lease payments, roughly about $7 billion throughout the course of this project.\n03:45 Speaker B\non all minimum power bills, about a billion dollars on other pass through expenses like insurance, operations, taxes and so forth. Having that commitment is critical because Google, in our opinion, is one of the most creditworthy companies in the world. They have a strong core business through their search engine that is able to generate one of the best cash flows as a company in the whole world. Then they have Gemini, they have their own TPUs in terms of manufacturing their own chips.\n04:23 Speaker B\nThey own YouTube, they own Android, they own Waymo for car uh collection. I think the next frontier of AI training is not just text training of the web, but on video recognition as well. So if you think about the all the footage that they pick up in those Waymo cars, all the video uh footage that they have in uh in on YouTube, we are massive believers not to even mention Quantum which they're leading in as well. And so we're big believers that Google has strong cash flows, one of the best in the world and that they also have a diversified business stream and is able to continue to grow and become a stronger and stronger business and partnering with them having their financial back stop and guarantee behind this project.\n05:14 Speaker B\nI think has given us, our lenders, our partners all a ton of confidence in the value of this specific deal.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company\n\nSamantha Dorisca\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nDarrell Spencer is shattering various glass ceilings.\nThe Chicago native credits his hustling nature to his parents. His mother works as a postmaster for the United States Postal Service. His father worked for the Chicago Police Department and rose through the ranks to become a commander before retiring. His father also has a real estate portfolio, which was an additional stream of revenue for the family and was an early sign for Spencer that there are other financial paths to follow outside the confines of corporate America.\n\nWorking In Big Tech After completing a bachelor’s in economics at Connecticut College on a full-tuition national scholarship, Spencer got a job in finance but later pivoted into big tech. He has worked at Facebook, Google, Pinterest, and LinkedIn within their customer sales department in advertising, he told AFROTECH. Still, he felt called to entrepreneurship.\n“I helped them generate millions of dollars in revenue through a strategy across each different platform at each company that I was at,” he shared. “Did really well there. However, I just didn’t feel fulfilled. I woke up every day feeling just like it was routine. And it got to a point where I was very dissatisfied with the trajectory of my life. I felt as if there was more in life that I had to do. And growing up, I’ve always known that I wanted to do something in business … I just never knew what I wanted to do, but I’ve always known I wanted to create.”\n\nLeap Into Entrepreneurship In 2021, Spencer’s first swing as a founder was with Kings Crowning, which offered a satin-lined cap that was a functional, stylish, alternative bonnet for men. The business launched from a storage unit and grew into a multimillion-dollar company, leading him to become a first-generation CEO and millionaire by the time he was 27 years old, per Business Insider.\n\nCrowned Skin Fast forward to March 2024, and Spencer is on to his next brainchild, Crowned Skin, a science-backed skincare and grooming brand for men. The inspiration for the company came from a place of frustration while walking down retail aisles, seeing little representation and few innovative products for men in these categories, he told AFROTECH\n.\nSpencer made an upfront investment of between $10,000 and $15,000 into Crowned Skin with the income generated from King’s Crowning, coupled with real estate investments. These funds were recouped within a few months, he recalled. The investment gave him the financial freedom to create products, establish warehousing, and fund advertising.\n“I just wanted to create products that made men feel seen and confident,” Spencer explained. “I think men across the board, there’s this stigma when it comes down to men’s beauty, men’s grooming. It’s this hush topic that men don’t feel comfortable talking about.”\n\nStory Continues\nCrowned Skin offers body butter, cologne, and body oil in a range of scents, including its newest scent, Empire.\nSpencer has been intentional with growing the company to be profitable and self-sustaining. Strategic decisions, such as pivoting early in Crowned Skin’s marketing messaging, have helped him guide the company towards those goals. Working at various big tech companies as an ads manager allowed him to understand the power of attention and how to retain it.\n\nThis knowledge influenced how the brand positioned its products. Spencer showed the functionality of the products, which include ultra-moisturizing and healing properties; aligned with what would resonate with men, such as the allure of certain scents; and demonstrated the products’ efficiency, as they could cut morning routines in half by functioning as a two-in-one product.\n“We ended up running with those street marketing pieces. And then we learned that through creative messaging, through compelling five- to ten-second ad content around that messaging, that’s what really compelled. That’s what really propelled the business forward very, very fast,” he acknowledged.\n“So then at that point, we were getting our revenue shot up. The business was funding itself. We were very profitable. We were mindful of our return on ad spend, and we were able to scale up as more funds came in. And the next thing we knew, at that point, we really didn’t need any outside investments,” he added. “We didn’t need any other injections of capital … We chose to scale intentionally and scale when revenue came in.”\n\nRevenue Crowned Skin earned $4 million in revenue within its first year and is now a multi-million-dollar company, Spencer confirmed to AFROTECH\n. This feat is aided by strong teams across financial, fulfillment, product development, and manufacturing. Additionally, e-commerce has remained a major component of Crowned Skin’s success through Amazon and TikTok Shop, which have particularly helped boost revenue for the venture.\n“If you want to be a highly competitive and successful brand and company in today’s age, you need to diversify, be on every e-commerce channel across the board, and be your best at all of them. TikTok Shop has been huge. TikTok shop is becoming one of our biggest revenue channels. And the way that you can work with affiliates and really seed samples and fuel your company through affiliates, but also the age of live selling on TikTok, we’re coming into a whole new age of e-commerce marketing,” Spencer explained.\nTikTok Shop has become a six-figure-a-month channel for the company. Crowned Skin also makes history as the first Black male-founded skincare company to reach the #2 spot on TikTok Shop, according to information shared with AFROTECH\n.\n“I get to really be a forward-thinking leader in this space as a Black man in an underrepresented category where there’s not many other Black males doing this … This all was self-taught … Representation is everything for me because I think there’s so many other Black men out there that are in that similar position, but honestly, fear might stunt them. I’m really proud that I get to really create this amazing company and showcase all that you can do as a Black man. If you truly put your head down, it really works,” Spencer explained.\n\nFirst Retail Partnership The overarching goal is to position Crowned Skin as a one-stop shop for men’s grooming. There are currently various products in research and development, including body washes and deodorants, Spencer told AFROTECH\n. It will also soon gain greater visibility following its first-ever retail partnership with Walmart.com. There are plans to later expand regionally, then nationally on store shelves, Spencer shared.\nSpencer also stated that he intends to raise a Series A, likely in 2026, to scale the company globally.\n\n“I want Crowned Skin to be around for years and years, and I want it to last even when I’m not here. I want this to be a legacy company … I want global access … That’ll be an amazing opportunity for us to scale to even more heights, bring on an amazing partner or partners right in this space that have done it, that have scaled companies to nine, 10 figures, and that can really position Crowned Skin to be one of the most dominating forces in men’s grooming,” he expressed.\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Buffett has likely had the greatest influence on my investing journey because his buy-and-hold method resonates strongly with me. When Buffett makes a move, I tend to pay attention because I want to see what he and his management team see.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also a huge fan of tech stocks (which is an area that Buffett has often steered clear of). I think tech stocks are among the most interesting investments on Wall Street because the companies are often dynamic and bring innovation to every sector of Wall Street. Whether you have a consumer goods company, a financial services organization, or a healthcare operation, you rely on technological advancements to improve your business and stay ahead of the competition.\nRecently, I have been paying closer attention to a company that offers the best of both worlds. It has outstanding management, strong earnings, and an insurmountable moat (just like Buffett prefers). And it also claims a front-row seat to how the world is changing and will be one of the most critical companies to help us get there.\nMy pick for the best buy-it-today-and-hold-it-forever stock is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nAbout Alphabet stock Alphabet is a member of the \" Magnificent Seven \" group of stocks that's been dominating Wall Street for the last several years, and it's also one of the biggest publicly traded companies in the world. Currently, Alphabet has a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion.\nThe company's stock is up a whopping 61% this year, which is great considering that Alphabet got off to a rough start, falling into bear market territory in April before recovering.\nOf course, with that comes a hefty valuation, but considering the sandbox that Alphabet plays in, its forward price-to-earnings ratio isn't that bad. There are four companies on the planet with a market cap greater than $3 trillion, and Alphabet stacks up favorably to them all.\nWhat to like about Alphabet stock There are two major things I'm looking at with Alphabet right now. First is the company's business model and revenue. And all that is good. Alphabet just turned in its first-ever quarter of $100 billion in revenue, bringing in $102.34 billion in the third quarter, up 16% from last year. The vast majority of that comes from advertising, which brought in $74.18 billion in the quarter thanks to its powerful YouTube platform, as well as its dominant position in internet search, in which Google maintains a 90% market share.\n\nStory Continues\nAll that helps Alphabet maintain 31% operating margin, with net income in the third quarter of $34.97 billion and $2.87 per share, up from $26.3 billion and $2.12 per share a year ago.\nThe second thing that I appreciate is Alphabet's innovation. Faced with a massive threat a year ago, as ChatGPT, TikTok, and other social media platforms threatened to cut into Google's search dominance, Alphabet harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to work in its favor. It rolled out AI Overviews on its search pages, generating summaries to answer users' queries using generative AI and advanced reasoning.\n\nAlphabet also uses AI to optimize and improve advertising, and on YouTube to recommend content.\nFinally, there's Google Cloud, the company's fast-growing cloud computing segment. Cloud computing is a growing field because companies running or training AI programs don't want to invest in expensive semiconductor clusters. Cloud services like Google Cloud are a more reasonable alternative, and it's one of the reasons why Google Cloud revenue jumped 33.5% in the third quarter from a year ago.\nAlphabet's growth curve is expected to continue, which is impressive for a company of its size and maturity.\nAlphabet is a buy right now Of course, I also can't ignore that Berkshire Hathaway took a stake in Alphabet in the third quarter -- and while it's impossible to know if Buffett himself pulled the trigger, the purchase of nearly 18 million shares of Alphabet stock will go down in history as one of the last transactions under Buffett's reign as CEO.\n\nThe company's core advertising business is a profit center that can't be duplicated, despite efforts by competitors such as Microsoft , Meta Platforms , and Amazon to encroach on the digital advertising market. Alphabet has too many advantages, is too entrenched, and management has proven its ability to adapt to any challenges. Meanwhile, the Google Cloud opportunity will continue to provide outsize growth to Alphabet's bottom line.\nI think it's the best stock to have right now for long-term investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $511,196 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,047,897 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 954 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Hut 8 CEO says $7 billion data center deal with Google is 'first domino to fall'\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 10:31 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: HUT\n\nGOOG\n\nBTC-USD\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nGS\n\nThe \"crypto miner\" label is becoming a relic of the past for Hut 8 ( HUT ).\nIn a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ). The move effectively trades the volatility of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for the high-margin stability of AI infrastructure.\n\n\"We think that the value of energy will continue to go up, and so for us, we [had] to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers, but that drove a strong return to our shareholders,\" Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\nThe market is rewarding the transformation. The energy infrastructure company's stock surged roughly 20% on Wednesday following the announcement as investors cheered its potential to secure blue-chip partners in a crowded field.\nBeyond the one-day pop, the stock has been a standout in the mining-to-AI pivot, fueled by the company's deep energy assets and its strategic partnership with American Bitcoin ( ABTC ), a Trump family enterprise in which Hut 8 holds a 60% stake. Year to date, Hut 8 stock is up 90%.\n\nThe linchpin of the Louisiana project is a financial guarantee from Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), which guarantees payments of the 15-year lease if Fluidstack, an AI cloud infrastructure provider, cannot meet them. The deal secures 245 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with the possibility to scale up to 2,300 MW within that timeframe — a move that could swell the total lease value to $17.7 billion.\n\n\"We're very excited because it's the first domino to fall,\" Genoot said. \"If we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full strategic partnership on 2,300 MW, we see a lot of growth upside for the company and the deal overall.\"\nThe creditworthiness was the key. Genoot noted that without Google's involvement, securing project financing from titans like JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) at favorable rates would have been nearly impossible.\nHe added that Google has a \"strong core business,\" including diversified cash flows from Search, YouTube, and cloud services, making the tech giant's pledge the ultimate security for a 15-year infrastructure play.\nHowever, securing the money is only half the battle. Competitors have seen their stocks hammered due to construction delays. Genoot claims Hut 8 has de-risked the execution side, partly by issuing a \"conservative delivery schedule\" and tapping local labor.\nThe company has turned to established industrial partners, including Jacobs Engineering for design and local contractors like Cajun Electric for electrical services. By scheduling the first data hall delivery for Q2 2027, Genoot said the company is avoiding the \"crunch\" of unrealistic timelines that has plagued the sector.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We signed all of these commitments at the same time,\" Genoot said. \"We're not only delivering a commitment to the customer, but we have commitments from all of our partners that they are going to deliver on that same commitment.\"\nAs Hut 8 doubles down on its new identity, the Miami-based company may still be undervalued by a market that largely views it through a crypto lens.\nAccording to Genoot, the Louisiana deal is just the beginning. \"It's about repeating this program again and again and again to start growing the value of this company,\" he said.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Starting in 2029, the streaming platform will broadcast the Oscars, marking a major shift for one of the entertainment industry's most recognizable events.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nYouTube's first telecast will be the 101st Academy Awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said it signed a multiyear deal running from 2029 through 2033. The agreement covers more than the awards ceremony itself, including red carpet arrivals, behind the scenes access, and coverage of the Governors Ball. Alphabet said U.S. viewers will be able to watch through YouTube TV, while audiences elsewhere can stream the show for free on YouTube.\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan said the partnership is about bringing the Oscars to a broader global audience while honoring its long standing cultural legacy. The move comes after the Academy's current deal with Disney's ABC, which runs through 2028.\nFor investors, the deal highlights YouTube's growing push into premium live events and its ambition to turn traditional TV moments into global streaming experiences.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Set to commence construction in early 2026, the Citra Energies solar farm will deliver renewable energy to power Google’s data center operations in the country.\nNew Deal Extends TTE’s Existing Collaboration With Google Google wants to utilize clean energy for its new AI based data centers and has been entering into long-term agreements with power providers for 24/7 supply of clean electricity. Last month, Google selected TotalEnergies to supply renewable power for its data centers in the United States.\n\nThe new contract to supply clean energy to Google’s data center in Malaysia seems to be an extension of the existing partnership of both these companies. TotalEnergies has been successfully providing clean energy to its customers across the globe, with is also acting in favour of this multi-energy provider.\n\nHow Will This Deal Benefit TTE? This long-term renewable power supply deal will secure a stable revenue stream for the company.\n\nThis deal will allow TotalEnergies to tap deeply into growing opportunities in the Southeast Asian region in the long run, as this region is experiencing rising demand for power supply due to the establishment of new data centers. The company is set to build a renewable power plant in Malaysia, providing access to the Malaysian market and offering strong, sustainable growth potential.\n\nThis new deal is in sync with TotalEnergies’ long-term vision on clean energy generation. The company is gradually building a portfolio of low-carbon businesses that could account for 15-20% of sales by 2040.\n\nRising Demand for Clean Energy The demand for clean energy is rising due to the development of large AI-based data centers, usage of more electric vehicles and higher usage of residential customers. Given the expected increase in clean energy demand, the power providers are also expanding their clean energy generation capacity.\n\nTotalEnergies continues to expand its clean energy generation capabilities to meet growing customer demand. Gross installed renewable power generation capacity was 32.3 GW at the end of the third quarter of 2025, up from 24.2 GW at the end of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOther operators have also outlined their goals to generate more energy from clean energy sources. With the changing demand scenario, these companies continue to make upward revision in their generation capacity.\n\nPrice Movement of TTE Over the past six months, TTE’s shares have risen 5.4%, which beat the industry’s growth of 1.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nZacks Rank & Key Pick TTE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "3 Best AI ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Quantum computing is an exciting theme, but one that's going to take some time to play out.\nInvestors should consider a broad spectrum of names beyond just the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nThe three ETFs below offer a range of options for investors to gain exposure to the AI sector.\n10 stocks we like better than Defiance Quantum ETF ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already well on its way to being the biggest technological revolution since the internet -- and it's still in the early innings.\nWhile names such as Nvidia , Microsoft , OpenAI , and Alphabet have emerged as the \"faces\" of AI, there are plenty of potential winners throughout the sector. Infrastructure builders, enterprise software creators, application developers, and cloud providers all play an integral part to the ecosystem. AI is far more than just semiconductor manufacturers.\nThat's why when it comes to investing in AI, it may be better to just buy the theme instead of trying to pick individual winners. Some of the biggest returns so far have been delivered by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. But stretched valuations, evidence of slowing momentum, and questions surrounding whether all the AI development spending will be worth it are beginning to plague some companies.\nAn ETF that can maintain exposure to some of those megacap names but look beyond them for additional opportunities may be the way to play it in 2026. Here are the three artificial intelligence ETFs that I'm favoring as we head into the new year.\n1. Defiance Quantum ETF If you're interested in true futuristic tech, quantum computing is probably for you. If artificial intelligence is the next revolution, quantum is the rocket that could really propel it to the next level.\nQuantum computing involves developing the technology for processing and calculating at speeds far beyond what traditional computers can do today. It has potential applications in technology, medicine, energy, finance, scientific discovery, and more.\n\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF (NASDAQ: QTUM) invests in companies at the forefront of quantum development. Top holdings right now include Tower Semiconductor , Rigetti Computing , Teradyne , Coherent , and Micron Technology .\nThe only Magnificent Seven name among the top 10 holdings is Alphabet, and it only comes in at No. 10, with a weight of 1.8%. So there's good diversification here relative to the broader tech sector and the equity market in general.\nQuantum is a little more niche and a lot more appropriate for a long-term holding than traditional AI stocks. It may be years before quantum becomes anything close to having mainstream applications, so it should be considered an investment in potential more than concrete current results.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF The Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) looks more like a traditional big tech ETF, but it's careful to include companies of all sizes and from all around the world. In that way, it's designed to be a more inclusive and comprehensive take on AI investing.\nThe fund's index starts by grouping companies in two categories:\n\nAI developers: Includes product and services developers and users, as well as companies that offer AI solutions as a service to customers.\nAI and big data analytics: Semiconductor, storage, and/or hardware manufacturers, as well as quantum computing developers.\nA minimum \"exposure score\" is required for inclusion. Qualifying components are weighted by market cap.\nAIQ is a nice middle ground between big and small companies, although it definitely tilts toward large caps. The AI exposure requirement is a nice way to build the portfolio and ensure that the fund is more of a pure AI play than just a generic megacap tech fund.\n3. Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) describes itself as the world's first generative AI ETF. It's unique in that it's the only actively managed fund among the three, which is advantageous in such a rapidly evolving space. But it also leans more toward the megacap names.\n\nTop holdings currently include Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms , and Palantir . Amazon , Broadcom , and Advanced Micro Devices also reside in the top 10, so there's very much a Nasdaq-100 index feel to this fund.\nIf you're looking for a straightforward, more \"conservative\" way to invest in AI, CHAT might not be a bad choice. You get the heavy large-cap exposure without a lot of the risk that comes from investing in newer or emerging names.\nShould you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF right now? Before you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Defiance Quantum ETF wasn’t one of them.

( HUT ) unveiled its own partnership with Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Fluidstack to build an AI data center in Louisiana. Alphabet's Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) is providing the backstop on this latter deal.\nHut 8 CEO Asher Genoot joins Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to explain how vital Google was to making this deal happen. Also watch Asher Genoot explain some of the details of the data center deal.\nHut 8 also owns a majority stake in American Bitcoin ( ABTC ), which was co-founded by Eric and Donald Trump, Jr.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nHow important was it that Google backstopped all this?\n00:03 Asher\nCritical. I mean, without Google, we would not be able to get JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs to commit the balance sheet financing to be able to give us up to 85% of the actual cost to build a data center for project financing, and at a really low rate of SOFR plus 2.25% target. And so overall, the the clarity of Google backstopping, and think about this.\n00:30 Asher\nIt's a $7 billion deal, that's roughly $450 million a year.\n00:33 Asher\n$450 million on average a year for 15 years for Hut 8 transforms the business. You look at mostly data center infrastructure multiples trade at a 15 to 20x multiple. That's somewhere between 7 and a half to 9 billion dollars of overall value. You take out the build costs, you're at 5 and a half to 7 billion dollars of equity value creation. And so overall, we're extremely excited because if you think about the company today, 330 megawatts alone is worth more than our full market cap today.\n01:10 Asher\nIn addition to that, we own 60% of American Bitcoin, which is another publicly traded company we have with the Trumps. That's worth about a billion dollars. We have about 10,000 Bitcoin on the balance sheet, that's worth another billion dollars. And then we have 9,000 megawatts, 1,000 that we currently operate, another 8,000 of new development megawatts that I haven't even counted. And so we're extremely excited that about the company, its future growth potential. I think this is the first step in showing the market we have an ability to take a site from the very, very beginning on a piece of land that we find to bring it to a commercialized AI data center.\n01:43 Speaker A\nAsher, what's the next step? Because if I, if it's, if I have this correct, you have a pipeline. What does that pipeline look like? And and are you just on the cusp of announcing more deals like you just announced?\n01:54 Asher\nYeah, so when we announced this deal, creating a program with partners that could scale is really important. You brought up Jacobs engineering. They have 40,000 contractors and engineers. You have Vertiv, one of the best equipment manufacturers within the whole data center space. Obviously, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have some of the largest balance sheets as banks. So we put together a group of partners that we believe could scale with us in our development pipeline. And so we spent this whole year creating that foundation, find the right customers who have the demand as well. And now it's about repeating this program again and again and again to start growing the value of this company. And we're extremely excited and we think, uh, if we're on here a year from today, we'll have uh had a lot of headway in the scale that we were able to deploy and develop for our shareholders.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nMatt Hussey,Jason Nelson\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:40 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMETA\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts —self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps , that run without banks, governments, or big tech.\n\nWhen programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain —not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games , digital art , and assets worth billions.\nUltimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.\nThis guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.\nSmart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.\nSmart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.\n\nWho Invented Ethereum? Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.\n\nDevelopment of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nA crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.\n\nThe network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.\nThe switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work\nThis shift, known as “ The Merge ,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.\nBlocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhat applications have been built on Ethereum? 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.\n📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.\n💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.\n💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.\n💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.\n🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.\n\nTimeline: Major milestones in Ethereum Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.\nMid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.\nJuly 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.\nSeptember 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.\nMarch 2016: Homestead upgrade improves protocol security and usability.\nApril 2016: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, launches via crowdsale.\nJune 2016: Hackers exploit The DAO and drain roughly $50 million in Ether.

A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes . Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.\nThe first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack , but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.\n\nWhat Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?\nSince then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon , to investment collectives like Syndicate , and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO , which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.\nSupporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.\nA network tested by crisis If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.\nEthereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.\nThe community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nEthereum and the NFT boom Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.\nThe breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties , CryptoPunks , and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\nBy 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million , and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.\nEthereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nThe race to scale Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.\nTo address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 . The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.\n\nVitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'\nEthereum and the Web3 vision Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.\n\nBut competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana , Cardano , and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.\nEthereum and privacy In 2025, privacy has become a key focus of the Ethereum project. In November, Vitalik Buterin stated that \"Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene,\" building on a narrative in which he framed it as a fundamental requirement for digital systems such as blockchain platforms.\nEthereum Foundation Launches New Cluster Focused on Privacy\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has followed suit, launching a privacy cluster in October 2025 that includes 47 researchers, coordinators and cryptographers. The Foundation also launched Kohaku, a \"privacy-first\" toolkit for Ethereum, alongside a browser wallet and SDK. Upon its launch, Buterin commented that \"Full-stack privacy and security are first-class priorities in Ethereum.\"\nA decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.\nWhat’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

JPMorgan's 2026 outlook, backed by new CEO survey data, suggests markets are now recalibrating expectations — shifting focus from AI adoption to whether it actually delivers profits.\nGenAI Fell Short Of CEO Expectations PwC's latest global CEO survey, covering more than 4,700 executives across 109 countries, shows a clear expectation gap. While over 40% of CEOs entered 2025 expecting GenAI to boost revenue and nearly half anticipated a lift in profitability, only about one-third reported meaningful gains in either metric by year-end. Efficiency improvements were more visible, but even those undershot initial expectations.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nJPMorgan's interpretation isn't that AI spending was misplaced — it's that monetization arrived slower than anticipated. Adoption moved quickly, but translating that into top-line and margin expansion proved harder than forecasts implied.\nFrom Experimentation To ROI Discipline That gap is now changing behavior. JPMorgan notes that boards and CFOs are pressing harder on return on investment, favoring projects with clearer financial outcomes over open-ended experimentation. Growth alone is no longer enough; it needs to come with margin discipline.\nAs a result, valuation frameworks are tightening. Metrics like the Rule of 40 — and JPMorgan's stricter Rule of X — are reasserting themselves as filters rather than afterthoughts.\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nWhy 2026 Will Look Different The implication for 2026 is straightforward.

Uh, congrats on this big uh moment for your company.\n00:23 Speaker A\nWalk us through the the process a bit because I sense you have been very disciplined on arriving to this point. It was very very important for you to not make just a bad deal.\n00:39 Asher Ganoot\nWe think that the value of energy will continue to go up. And so for us, we had to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers but that drove a strong return to our shareholders. And so the announcement of our deal yesterday, we had actually two announcements. One was an announcement with Anthropic to have the opportunity to scale with them for 2,300 overall megawatts. Then the actual deal we signed itself that was $7 billion was only 330 megawatts, which is 245 megawatts of IT load.\n01:13 Asher Ganoot\nAnd so, for 245 megawatts of IT load, we announced a $7 billion deal that had a financial financial backstop with Google. And so, we're very, very excited because this is the first domino to fall. Um, if we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full uh strategic partnership on 2,300 megawatts, we see a lot of growth upside for the company. And the deal overall, not only did we announce that Google was creating a financial backstop, we had great partners like Fluidstack and Anthropic, but also that we had execution partners to deliver the data center.\n01:46 Asher Ganoot\nFrom JP Morgan to Goldman Sachs providing the financing, and to Jacob's Engineering and to Vertive providing the contracting and the supply chain.

For the average investor out there, Asher, why would an Anthropic need this much power? Break that down for us.\n02:14 Asher Ganoot\nThey're growing month over month. I mean, if you look at some of the public reports, their revenue has been increasing by billion dollars ARR every single month. And so as they continue to grow, they need additional compute to keep up with the demand of their users. And so they're one of the fastest growing companies in the world right now, and we'd like to provide the our first infrastructure layer to be able to allow them to keep up with that demand and continue to build out those models and those inference and training solutions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Charlie Munger Said, 'Find A Way To Get Your Hands On $100,000' Even If It Means Walking Everywhere — The Magic Number If You Want To Be Rich\n\nJeannine Mancini\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nCharlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

The 15 year, US$7.00 billion Fluidstack lease directly strengthens the near term catalyst of more predictable, infrastructure like cash flows, but it does not remove the key risks tied to Bitcoin exposure, project execution and the capital intensity of River Bend and other builds.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement is the Anthropic and Fluidstack partnership, which sets a framework for Hut 8 to deploy at least 245 MW and potentially up to 2,295 MW of AI data center capacity. That context matters for this lease because it links the River Bend campus to an identified AI tenant ecosystem, reinforcing the idea that Hut 8’s growth runway increasingly depends on executing large, complex AI and high performance computing projects alongside Bitcoin focused operations.\nYet the biggest risk investors should be aware of is how quickly execution or Bitcoin volatility could pressure...\nRead the full narrative on Hut 8 (it's free!)\nHut 8’s narrative projects $767.3 million in revenue and $140.6 million in earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Tesla’s ‘Musk Premium’ in Focus With SpaceX IPO in View\n\nJordan Fitzgerald\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nMU\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\n(Bloomberg) -- (Updates stock price after Thursday’s open)\nElon Musk is selling investors a future of driverless cars, robot assistants and life on Mars. The problem for investors is there’s only one way to buy into his vision: Tesla Inc.’s stock.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker’s shares were up nearly 3% on Thursday. They hit their first record of the year on Tuesday amid gains of more than 20% over the last four weeks. Since tumbling to a low on April 8 during the height of panic over the Trump administration’s tariffs, the stock has soared almost 120%, putting it among the 20 best performers in the S&P 500 Index.\nThe rally is a testament to Wall Street’s faith in Musk’s artificial intelligence ambitions, particularly since Tesla’s core auto business is struggling. But it has also made Tesla shares extremely expensive. At 214 times earnings over the next 12 months, the stock has the second highest valuation in the S&P 500, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and far ahead of number three, Palantir Technologies Inc., another high-flyer that trades at 178 times forward earnings as of Wednesday’s close.\n\n“The valuation doesn’t make any sense,” said Vikram Rai, portfolio manager and macro trader at First New York, which sold its Tesla position earlier this year after Musk and President Donald Trump had a very public fallout on social media.\nA Tesla representative didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nWith Musk’s SpaceX possibly going public next year, stock traders looking for “Elon exposure” will likely have another way to get it before long. The space exploration company is planning an insider share sale that would value it at $800 billion, making it the most expensive privately held business in the world. Its initial public offering would be the largest ever.\n\n“A SpaceX IPO could lead to some selling pressure on Tesla shares,” said Dmitry Shlyapnikov, an analyst at Horizon Investments who works with portfolio managers. “There are investors that own Tesla for exposure to Elon’s ideas and not for the car company attached to the ticker.”\nOf course, there’s another school of thought that a SpaceX public stock offering would shine a spotlight on Musk, giving Tesla another jolt of momentum.\n\nStory Continues\n“Historically, when one of Musk’s companies achieves a major milestone, it tends to lift sentiment for the others,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. “A high-profile SpaceX IPO could attract a fresh wave of investors who are drawn to his innovation story — and that enthusiasm often spills over into Tesla.”\n\nSo far, Tesla’s stock price is getting a boost from the hype surrounding SpaceX, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. The missions of the two companies are interlinked, he said, describing a future where Tesla’s Optimus robots help with Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, and SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system bolsters vehicle connectivity on Earth.\nThe companies also share lofty valuations. But Tesla skeptics question whether the company’s fundamentals can support those numbers. Its sales are slowing and profits are falling, while regulations rise and consumers spend less on cars.\n“If you’ve been long Tesla stock, you’ve made money, there’s no denying it,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, who has a small short position in Tesla. “It’s just bizarre to me because the fundamentals are so bad.”\n\n‘Double-Down on Elon’\nOptimists, on the other hand, point to Tesla’s growth prospects with opportunities in autonomous driving and robotaxis. Musk’s goal is to transform Tesla from an auto manufacturer to an artificial intelligence and robotics company. He wrote in a September X post that 80% of the firm’s profits will eventually come from robots.\n“We believe Tesla’s earnings are going to be growing at 30% to 35% over the next two to three years based on the innovation that they have in the automotive segment,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns the company’s shares.\nIf Musk can pull that off, Tesla’s stock market valuation would make more sense. If he can’t, that’s where SpaceX comes in. Publicly traded shares of SpaceX would give investors the opportunity to own a piece of Musk’s vision without Tesla’s baggage.\n\n“I think most investors will not want to double-down on Elon,” First New York’s Rai said. “That is a lot of risk to carry.”\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce disagrees.\n“We don’t see investors making an either/or choice, but instead backing both companies,” he said. “Investors that have made money in Tesla are likely to want to back another Musk venture.”\nFor now, the reality for investors is Tesla is the only way to bet on Musk’s vision. The immediate risk is the stock’s valuation, which is getting close to dangerous territory. On a technical level, the shares had been close to being considered overbought earlier this week. When they last reached that level in early October, the stock fell 10% over the next seven sessions.\n“In the short term, it’s probably ready for a bit of a cooling off type of period after having that all-time high,” Mulberry said.\n\nBut to long-term Musk believers, the valuation may indeed be a short-term concern. Over the next few years, however, many see Tesla as a buy regardless of the price — possibly even more than SpaceX.\n“I fully believe that at some point there will be a commercial mission to Mars, but probably not in my lifetime,” said Mulberry, who is 51 years old. “Does that mean I want to invest in that stock today? You’d have to have a really long view of that, whereas you could see the impact of robotaxis and robots probably in the next three to five years.”\nTop Tech News\nMicron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, a sign that surging demand and supply shortages are allowing the company to charge more for products.\nThe growing acrimony over the biggest deal in Hollywood is spilling into the open.

      "Content": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nKO\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Beverage behemoth Coca-Cola is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s longest-held and biggest positions.\nYou know Amazon as an e-commerce powerhouse, but that’s not quite what makes it such a promising long-term prospect.\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet has proven it’s willing and able to successfully build or acquire businesses that expand its digital consumer-facing ecosystem.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nThe end of an era is almost upon us. After 55 years at the helm, at the end of this year, Warren Buffett will be stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and chief stock-picker.\nAnd when he goes, many members of the investment community could find themselves at a loss. Although Berkshire isn't just a mutual fund, plenty of investors took Buffett's lead by copying Berkshire's trades; now the conglomerate's stock picks won't necessarily be Buffett-approved holdings. So, if you want to know for sure that you're following in his footsteps, you'd better act soon.\nTo this end, here's a rundown of three names currently in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio that you not only know the Oracle of Omaha likes well enough to own them, but each of which could safely be bought and held forever.\n1. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) isn't just one of Berkshire's longest-held positions at 19 years. It's also become the conglomerate's third-biggest holding, currently worth $28 billion. That's 10% of Berkshire's entire publicly traded portfolio.\nIt's not hard to see why Buffett's been such a long-term fan of the beverage giant, either. Not only is it the biggest and best-known name in the business, but it's a dividend machine! In addition to paying a dividend like clockwork for decades, The Coca-Cola Company has raised its per-share dividend payment for 63 consecutive years (and counting). This year, Berkshire's 400 million shares of KO will provide Buffett and his lieutenants with more than $200 million in cash. Never even mind the near-200% gain this stock's price alone has produced since Buffett first bought it back in late 2006.\n\nIt's also a great \"forever\" stock for two other reasons. One of these is simply that the world will always need something to drink. With brands like Gold Peak tea, Powerade sports drinks, Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, and, of course, its namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company has something to offer everyone.\nAnd the other reason this name's got staying power worth buying into? Its sheer size (read \"deep pockets\") -- the drinks giant can afford to outspend its competitors. For perspective, Coca-Cola spent more than $5 billion on advertising last year alone.\n\nStory Continues\nNo, it may not be fair. Investors don't want a fair fight, however. They want the companies they own to have an unfair advantage over their competition.\n2. Amazon Yes, Berkshire Hathaway holds a stake in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . It's not a big stake, mind you -- just 10 million shares currently worth about $2.2 billion. That's less than 1% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\nStill, the fact that he's willing to let Berkshire hold any Amazon at all is noteworthy just because Buffett has typically eschewed such flashy technology stocks, explaining that he doesn't always fully understand their business models. And to be sure, the pick was likely encouraged by Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler, who help oversee the conglomerate's equity holdings.\n\nThe pick also makes much more sense to Buffett now, however, than it would have several years ago.\nWhile Amazon may have been something of an unknown in its infancy (when the internet itself was still young and evolving, and when Buffett was forming his previous opinion on most technology stocks), even he would have to agree that uncertainty no longer applies. E-commerce is clearly here to stay, and Amazon clearly leads at least the U.S. e-commerce market; it isn't doing too badly overseas either. All told, despite its already-massive size, this company's product sales are up more than 8% through the first three quarters of this year. This growth rate accelerated last quarter, too, despite the lethargic economy here and abroad.\nAmazon isn't just e-commerce anymore, either. Although it only accounts for a minority of its revenue, its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, contributes roughly 60% of the company's total operating income. And the cloud computing industry is here to stay as well. Indeed, Straits Research expects the worldwide cloud computing industry to grow from less than $1 trillion this year to nearly $3.7 trillion per year by 2033.\n\nWhat makes this name such a great forever holding, however, is that -- not unlike Berkshire Hathaway itself -- Amazon has proven that it's willing and able to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace of opportunities.\n3. Alphabet Finally, add Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold forever for yourself.\nThere are actually several clear parallels between Berkshire's positions in Amazon and Alphabet. Both are holdings that wouldn't have likely even been considered as potential picks a few years ago, for instance, yet both businesses have clearly solidified in the meantime. Both companies are also flexible; Amazon added cloud computing to its repertoire several years ago and is now turning its online shopping platform into an advertising medium, while Alphabet has moved well beyond its Google search engine with profit centers like YouTube and its own cloud computing service. Berkshire doesn't exactly have a huge stake in either outfit, only holding 17.8 million shares currently worth about $5.5 billion. That's less than 2% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\n\nIt's also a pretty safe bet that this position is the result of prodding from Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.\nWhatever the case, Buffett's pseudo-endorsement of Alphabet serves as a green light of sorts for you, plugging you into the company that still handles 90% of the world's web searches (according to Statcounter).\nThat's not the chief reason Alphabet is such a great long-term bet, though. The biggest and best bullish argument here is a more philosophical one. That's Alphabet's willingness and ability to build or buy a business, anything that allows it to expand its digital ecosystem.\nYouTube is one example; Google acquired it back in 2006. Alphabet's chat-based artificial intelligence platform Gemini is another example, as is 2004's launch of Gmail and 2005's acquisition of mobile operating system Android, which Statcounter says is installed on 72% of the world's mobile devices.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" arm is home to developing self-driving taxi service Waymo and life-science outfit Verily.\nSome of these projects pan out. Others don't. There's a reason, however, that Alphabet has only failed to produce year-over-year quarterly revenue growth once in the past 10 years. That's the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 -- and that was a short-lived headwind. Its profit growth has been almost as persistent. There's no end in sight to this growth streak, either. There's just too much worldwide dependence on Alphabet's offerings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Trump Media is merging with fusion power company TAE Technologies in $6B+ deal\n\nTim De Chant, Amanda Silberling\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies , a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.\nThe all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.\n\nTMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch , the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”\nTMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.\nTruth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.\n\nTMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.\nBut the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.\nCurrently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion , are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.\n\nIf one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.\n\nOver the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.\nIn the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.\nAfter the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Trump Media and Technology Group will be the holding company for businesses including Truth Social platform, TAE Power Solutions and TAE Life Sciences.\n\nTrump Media shares jumped 33% in premarket trading, drawing traction on Stocktwits, a social media hub for retail investors. The money-losing company's stock has declined nearly 70% ​this year.\n\"TAE will also clearly have major political support from President Trump in our view,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.\nFUSION TECHNOLOGY\nCompanies and ‌physicists at national laboratories have been trying for decades to foster fusion reactions, in which light atoms are forced together under extreme temperatures to release huge amounts of energy, a process that fuels the sun.\nBig hurdles to commercialize fusion include getting more energy out of a reaction than what goes into it and developing plants that can withstand streams of fusion reactions to power the grid.\n\nTAE CEO Binderbauer and other fusion company leaders met with U.S. Energy Department officials this month, weeks after the department formed its first ever fusion ⁠office.\nThe company, which has raised more than $1.3 billion in private funding, is aiming ​to develop and sell next‑generation neutral beam systems for fusion and related applications ​in a more cost‑effective manner.\n\nStory Continues\nTrump Media has agreed to provide up to $200 million in cash to TAE at signing and $100 million more upon initial filing of the registration.

      "Content": "AI data centers are eating the memory industry, and it could hurt your wallet\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 5:09 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSSNLF\n\n000660.KS\n\nMemory maker Micron ( MU ) reported a blowout first quarter earnings report on Wednesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines and offering a better-than-anticipated outlook for the second quarter, as data center builders look to grab as much of the company's memory chips as possible.\nMicron builds memory, known as DRAM, for data centers. And as data center construction booms in the US, that memory is selling at a premium.\n\nThere's just one problem: DRAM is also used in devices like smartphones and laptops.\nConsumer PCs and other systems use a type of DRAM called double data rate memory (DDR), while data centers use a version of DRAM called high-bandwidth memory, HBM.\nDRAM suppliers are currently focusing more on building HBM than DRAM, thanks to higher margins on data center parts. And that's starving the broader market.\nIt's not just PC buyers who are feeling the sting, either. Everything from cars to medical equipment could be impacted by the dearth of memory chips.\nCompounding that is the fact that, ahead of its earnings, Micron announced that it is exiting the consumer memory business to focus on providing memory to AI data centers.\n\"It's not going to be good for consumers, because it's driving prices up, and very soon,” Ryan Reith, group vice president for IDC's worldwide device tracker, told Yahoo Finance.\nA massive memory crunch While most of us tend to think of GPUs powering AI data centers, they're only part of the server clusters that run apps like OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) ChatGPT and Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Gemini. In addition to CPUs and storage, they also need large pools of memory.\nThe problem? There are only a few major memory manufacturers in the world. That includes big-name companies like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron ( MU ). And the incredible demand for data center equipment is driving up prices across the entire industry.\n\nAccording to Reuters , Samsung has increased the prices of some memory by as much as 60%. Enthusiast site PCPartPicker , which tracks the prices of various memory sticks, shows the cost of some memory climbing from $100 to nearly $450.\n\"I think the general consensus is that in the last month … this has gotten a lot more attention, and not in a positive way,\" Reith said, adding that the price impact will likely end up getting passed through to consumers, especially on low-cost laptops.\nThat's because companies that produce entry-level and midrange systems have less room to maneuver when it comes to pricing before they completely eat through their margins.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"All of those things are essentially PCs. Any embedded device, game consoles, specialized medical equipment, those are all embedded computers, and they all have memory, and they all have storage of some kind,\" TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut memory companies don't necessarily mind if there's a shortage of components for PCs and other systems as long as they're raking in cash on HBM, especially because the margins on HBM are higher than other types of memory.\nThere are some ways device makers can try to offset the increased price of memory, including using cheaper, less powerful components elsewhere in their products or putting pressure on suppliers to reduce costs, explained Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.\nThis isn't the first time the tech industry has had to contend with memory supply problems, however. It is, after all, a notoriously cyclical market.\n\"What happens is, there's huge demand, and capacity gets built out, but it's never smooth,\" O'Donnell said.\n\n\"So … you get to the point where all demand gets sucked up, so you build these new factories, then you end up with a ton more capacity, and then the prices drop precipitously because there's too much capacity,\" he added.\nBut with so many companies building data centers across the globe, it's difficult to tell when the memory market will come back down.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The group plans to spend $1 billion on credits between 2022 and 2030.\nIts latest deal covers 122,000 metric tons of CO2 to be locked away ​between 2026 and 2030 by NULIFE GreenTech, which converts agricultural and ‌industrial waste - including grease from food processing - into bio-oil. The credits were purchased at an average weighted price of $362 per ton.\nNULIFE uses high-pressure cooking to break down waste into substances such as bio-oil, which is injected into salt caverns more than 1,000 metres underground ⁠for permanent storage. Frontier estimates the ​technology could scale to 1.5 gigatons of ​carbon removal annually by 2040.\n\"The goal at Frontier is really to create a portfolio of solutions that we ‍think are most ⁠likely to go the distance to a gigaton scale future,\" Hannah Bebbington Valori, Frontier’s head of deployment, said in an interview.\nScientists ⁠say carbon removal projects are critical to offset emissions from sectors that continue ‌to rely on fossil fuels.\n(Reporting by Simon Jessop and ‌Susanna Twidale.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided.

      "Content": "Got $1,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nORCL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia boasts of exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\nAlphabet’s full-stack AI approach is proving to be a key competitive advantage.\nIonQ can prove to be a high-growth, high-risk addition to a large and well-diversified investment portfolio.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe Federal Reserve's much-awaited 25-basis-point interest rate cut, announced on Dec. 10, has not delivered the market relief many investors had hoped for. While tech stocks initially jumped, the optimism was quickly replaced as renewed concerns around artificial intelligence (AI)-powered stocks resurfaced. Investor sentiment has further deteriorated after AI cloud giant Oracle missed earnings estimates in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Nov. 30, 2025), raising concerns about its ability to convert high-level capital investment into sustained profits.\nWith markets swinging sharply in response to changing sentiment, long-term investors can convert today's uncertainty into an entry opportunity. In case you have $1,000 not required to pay bills and debt or kept aside for contingencies, then investing in any of these three stocks can help generate wealth in the long run.\n\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might seem like the most obvious buy-and-hold pick for decades, and for good reason.\nThe company's exceptional long-term order visibility, worth nearly $500 billion of Blackwell and Rubin systems through 2025 and 2026, is itself a strong indicator of the durability of its long-term growth trajectory. While $150 billion in orders have already shipped, $350 billion worth of orders remain. Nvidia has expanded its strategic partnership with Saudi Public Investment Fund-backed AI company HUMAIN to jointly deploy up to 600,000 of its latest GPU systems over the next three years. This, coupled with a new compute capacity supply agreement with Anthropic, has expanded Nvidia's multiyear demand in addition to the $500 billion.\n\nThe reopening of the Chinese market is also a significant growth catalyst, considering that Nvidia once earned nearly 20% to 25% of its data center revenue from this market. Recently, the U.S. government approved the export of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, provided that 25% of the revenue is paid to the U.S. Treasury. According to a Reuters report, the company has informed Chinese clients that it is evaluating options to expand H200 chip production to meet the surging demand. While the Chinese government has yet to formally approve the purchases of these chips, the report notes that several Chinese technology companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already contacted Nvidia to secure supply.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the stellar demand, visibility, and expanding market access, Nvidia stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 23 and a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.48. While the stock may experience short-term volatility due to changes in hyperscaler spending and policy shifts, its long-term growth story remains intact. Hence, investors should be picking up a stake in this stock, especially at its current reasonable valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has also become a crucial player in the global development of AI infrastructure. The company exited the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025) with a Google Cloud backlog of $155 billion, up 46% on a sequential basis. Customers also entered into a larger number of deals valued at over $1 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared to the combined total of the previous two years. Additionally, nearly 70% of the company's cloud customers are already using the company's AI products.\n\nThe rapid pace of enterprise adoption and improved multiyear revenue visibility of Google Cloud can be partly attributed to the company's full-stack AI strategy, spanning AI infrastructure, proprietary chips, AI models, and enterprise platforms. The full-stack approach is helping Google Cloud support large-scale AI deployments more efficiently. This, in turn, is contributing to improving margins and deepening existing customer relationships.\nBeyond Cloud, Alphabet's strategy of embedding AI across its ecosystem is also delivering strong results. AI experiences are already driving higher engagement in Search through AI Mode and AI Overviews. The company is seeing a higher number of overall queries, including commercial queries, which present additional avenues for monetization. YouTube is also benefiting from AI-driven recommendation systems and is witnessing robust double-digit revenue growth from advertising and subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet is generating durable cash flows from its consumer products, while Google Cloud is well positioned to ride the multiyear enterprise AI wave. The company trades at 27.6 times forward earnings, which appears rich. However, considering its scale, diversified revenue base, and technological edge, Alphabet can be a solid long-term pick even at an elevated valuation level.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is too speculative to serve as a core holding in a diversified portfolio. However, this quantum computing specialist could still merit a small allocation for investors seeking exposure to its long-term growth optionality or those growth drivers that cannot be fully modeled.\nIonQ has delivered exceptional top-line performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), with revenue soaring 222% year over year to $39.9 million, exceeding even the upper end of its own guidance by 37%. IonQ also has $3.5 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet, allowing the company to invest in future growth initiatives.\n\nManagement has highlighted multiple technical and product-specific milestones. The company successfully deployed its #AQ 64 Tempo system (capable of running large and complex quantum circuits) three months ahead of schedule and achieved a record two-qubit fidelity of 99.99% (meaning the system executes two-qubit operations correctly 99.99% of the time).\nIonQ is focused on expanding its presence beyond quantum computing, into associated areas, such as quantum networking, sensing, and security, through targeted acquisitions, including that of Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, and a controlling stake in ID Quantique. The company is also exploring commercialization opportunities through large-scale solutions-based contracts and a land-and-expand strategy. The company is thus striving to build long-term and sticky client relationships.\n\nStill, investors should remain aware of IonQ's risks, considering that the company is loss-making and incurring significant expenses on innovation. IonQ stock trades at 208.3 times sales, which is also very rich. Yet, the stock can be a good addition provided it does not exceed 5% of a large diversified portfolio.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?
