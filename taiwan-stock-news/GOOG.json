      "Content": "Inside OpenAI's $1.5 million compensation packages\n\nCatherine Baab\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 5:48 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nOpenAI is paying its employees at levels that have little precedent in Silicon Valley history — $1.5 million in stock-based compensation per employee in 2025. That’s according to financial projections shared with investors and first reported by the Wall Street Journal .\nSuch compensation dwarfs what earlier generations of tech giants paid their workforces before going public. Adjusted for inflation, OpenAI's equity payouts are multiples above the norm for large tech firms over the past two decades, and even several times higher than what Alphabet or Meta disclosed ahead of their IPOs.\n\nFerocious competition for AI talent The $1.5 million figure makes clear just how fierce the competition is for top AI talent, with compensation for individual employees beginning to resemble packages that were once reserved for founders .\nAs generative AI models become central to corporate strategy, researchers and engineers with the most relevant expertise are becoming some of the most expensive employees anywhere in the world. To retain current employees and win sought-after job candidates, rival research labs and tech giants must make staggering offers .\n\nA classic example of \"prisoner's dilemma\" In game theory, such a dynamic is known as “ prisoner's dilemma ,” which describes situations in which competition effectively forces participants to escalate costs beyond what any individual would prefer.\nIn this case, if leading AI firms collectively capped compensation, they'd all benefit from lower costs and less-diluted equity. But no single company can afford restraint when competitors are bidding aggressively — not when falling behind in talent means falling behind in the technology itself. The result is a bidding war none of the participants can escape, even as it pushes the economics of AI development into increasingly unprecedented territory.\n\nAccordingly, OpenAI has had to loosen internal equity rules to stay competitive. One recent change removed a waiting period that required employees to stay six months before stock awards began vesting — a nod to a job market where researchers frequently move between companies and can command immediate payouts.\nCompensation now consumes 50% of OpenAI's revenue For OpenAI, this compensation strategy carries steep costs — in several senses. The company has about 4,000 employees at present, and stock compensation now consumes about half of the company’s annual revenue. That’s an unusually high share that likely contributes to operating losses and, at the same time, functions to dilute existing shareholders.\n\nStory Continues\nIn historical terms, the numbers are even more jarring. Among major tech companies that eventually went public, stock-based compensation typically accounted for a modest, single-digit percentage of revenue in pre-IPO years. But at OpenAI, it now approaches 50%.\nWhat’s more, per Wall Street Journal reporting , OpenAI’s investor materials suggest those costs will keep rising for years, even as the company continues to invest heavily in infrastructure and development.\nSo, can it last? Whether the strategy proves sustainable or not, it captures something essential about the contemporary tech economy. The overall pattern is familiar — a handful of firms create world-historical value while a tiny fraction of workers capture most of the gains — but the scale makes earlier booms look quaint. OpenAI is just making the math more explicit and more extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But I think the the the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So, you know, a lot of people should be actually reallocating now. Maybe not today, you know, on a few of the last trading days in the uh in the sessions here, but, you know, from a tax consequence standpoint. But I think, you know, you have an opportunity in the forward, you know, months coming forward here in 2024, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think I think the the point is is that you should. Don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n00:54 Speaker A\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n00:58 Speaker B\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, one out of every 10 years that you know, they've outperformed and we get seven out of 10 on the uh broader markets of out performance. So I like to stay US. So, you know, my thought is is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2024, but, you know, the dollar may, you know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cost average in, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just uh hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Analysts think Apple can launch another iPhone \"super cycle\" if the new Siri experience is appealing.\nThe delay came after Apple's AI unit lost top executive John Giannandrea this year. Apple CEO Tim Cook says Siri would debut in 2026, the company's 50th anniversary.\nDespite setbacks, U.S. trade tariff relief and hardware industry optimism raised Apple's stock 35% in 2025. Before Siri's launch, investors are worried about Apple's innovation pipeline.\nApple will provide free AI, unlike subscription-based competitors, therefore its upside depends on hardware sales.

In April last year it stopped developing its long-running Wordtune product line, described as an AI-based writing and reading tool used for rewriting and generating text.\nAI21 has since shifted its focus towards specialised language models aimed at corporate clients, rather than mass-market products such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Cloud.\n\nThe company is targeting customers where the consequences of mistakes are higher and dependable, verified information is a priority.\nIts enterprise product is called Maestro and is intended to lift the accuracy of language models by 50%, according to the report.\nIn recent months, AI21 has also introduced a reasoning model it says is faster and more advanced than rival offerings, while using less memory.\nDespite these developments, estimates cited in the report put AI21’s revenue at around $50m, far below competitors that are already generating billions of dollars.\nSeparately, Nvidia is planning an expansion in Israel, including a new R&D campus in Kiryat Tivon, south of Haifa, intended to support up to 10,000 employees.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has said the campus would include up to 160,000m² of office space, parks and shared areas across 22 acres, modelled on its Santa Clara, California, headquarters.\nConstruction is expected to begin in 2027, with initial occupancy planned for 2031.\n\"Nvidia in talks to buy Israel’s AI21 Labs for up to $3bn – report\" was originally created and published by Verdict , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on the year ahead too.\nPowered by the artificial intelligence trade once again, the 2025 financial markets story might seem, on the surface, to be a rerun of what investors lived through in 2023 and 2024.\n\nShine a bit of light on the subject, however, and we see the inner workings of the market's path in 2025 spun an eventful story that won't soon be forgotten.\nDonald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president.\nThe largest company in the world lost nearly 20% of its value in a single day.\nThe S&P 500 registered its worst week since the COVID crash of 2020, crashing 10% in just two days.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%.\nGold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year in two generations. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory Continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

Three of the index’s top 10 performers in 2025 were data storage companies, which are among the main beneficiaries of the hundreds of billions of dollars in pledged spending by the giant AI cloud service providers known as hyperscalers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nOn the flip side, economic uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs weighed on the shares of consumer companies, while health-care stocks struggled with uncertainty surrounding the administration’s policies and pressure on drug prices.\nHere are some of the biggest winners and losers in the US stock market this year.\n\nWinner: New AI Leadership Technology stocks, especially those tied to AI, again dominated the market. But leadership shifted to the shares of companies associated with data — from storage to the building, heating and cooling of data centers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ) Corp., Amazon.com ( AMZN ) Inc., Alphabet ( GOOG ) Inc. and Meta Platforms ( META ) Inc. have pledged to spend more than $440 billion over the next 12 months to build out AI capabilities, benefiting firms such as Sandisk ( SNDK ) Corp., Western Digital ( WDC ) Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc ( STX ), which were three of the four best performing stocks in the S&P 500.\nWinner: New S&P 500 Additions A slew of companies were added to the S&P 500 in 2025, including Robinhood ( HOOD ) Markets Inc., Sandisk, AppLovin ( APP ) Corp. and Carvana ( CVNA ) Co., all of which posted triple-digit percentage gains and landed among the top 20 performers in the index.\nOf course, not every stock that joined the S&P 500 got a boost. Trade Desk ( TTD ) Inc. shares were the worst performers in the index with a nearly 70% loss, while Block ( XYZ ) Inc. tumbled more than 20% and Coinbase ( COIN ) Global Inc. sank more than 6%.\n\nWinner: Palantir Palantir ( PLTR ) Technologies Inc. shares are set to notch a triple-digit gain for the third year in a row. The software developer got a boost from AI enthusiasm and strong buy-in from retail traders who are drawn to the company’s outspoken Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp.\n\nBut the stock is now rather pricey. With a multiple of more than 180 times forward earnings, it’s the third most expensive member of the S&P 500 behind Tesla Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWinner: Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ) soared almost 175% in 2025 on the strength of takeover speculation. The company formally put itself up for sale in October, and there’s an ongoing battle between the top two bidders, Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) Corp. and Netflix ( NFLX ) Inc., with both suitors jockeying to strengthen financial backing for their offers.\nThe Warner Bros. board prefers the Netflix bid and is reportedly planning to reject Paramount’s offer, but Larry Ellison, the billionaire chairman of Oracle Corp. and father of Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison, is personally guaranteeing the Paramount proposal.\nLoser: Consumer Staples Economic uncertainty, tariffs and concerns about the health of the US consumer as inflation creeps higher weighed on consumer stocks, especially some major staples names. Clorox ( CLX ) Co., frozen french fries maker Lamb Weston ( LW ) Holdings Inc., Campbell’s ( CPB ) Co. and beverage giant Constellation Brands ( STZ ) Inc. were among the 20 worst-performers in the S&P 500. Shares of fast-casual dining brand Chipotle ( CMG ) Mexican Grill Inc. sank nearly 40% after two years of double-digit gains.\n\nLoser: Retail The same economic uncertainty also hit shares of some retail companies. Deckers ( DECK ) Outdoor Corp., which owns brands such as Hoka and Ugg, was down almost 50% in 2025, snapping a nine-year streak of gains. The stock was hit hard by a few weak earnings forecasts and analyst downgrades.\nLululemon ( LULU ) Athletica Inc. shares are set to fall nearly 45% this year, their second consecutive double-digit annual decline, as the athletic apparel retailer struggles through an overhaul after a period of slow growth and the recent exit of its chief executive officer. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in the company.\n\nLoser: Managed Care Health insurance stocks underperformed in 2025 despite hopes that the group would benefit from a shift in policy by the Trump administration. Molina ( MOH ) Healthcare Inc. shares were down more than 40%, their second straight year of double-digit declines. UnitedHealth ( UNH ) Group Inc. and Centene ( CNC ) Corp. have both shed more than 30%, putting them among the 25 worst performers in the S&P 500.\nStill, there are signs of hope for the group as some investors view the beaten-down valuations as attractive, making the stocks possibly due for a rebond. Money manager Michael Burry has said he’s long Molina shares and that he views the company as acquisition target in 2026 if it remains this cheap.\n\n—With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others.\n\nIn the online search arena, Google has a monopoly accounting for roughly 90% of the online search volume and market share. Over the years, the company has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\nAI Cannibalization Fears Overblown\nAlphabet&rsquo;s dominant search market share and expanding cloud footprint are key growth drivers for the company. Initially, Google&rsquo;s AI efforts got off to a shaky start. For instance, in Google&rsquo;s first version AI model named &ldquo;Bard,&rdquo; searches often were completely inaccurate.\nMeanwhile, it appeared that ChatGPT and other models were running away with the AI race. However, several iterations later, and Google&rsquo;s Gemini 2.5 AI delivers some of the most rapid responses in the industry and is viewed as an industry standard.\n\nInvestor fears about cannibalization of the search business are unfounded. In fact, Google&rsquo;s unique hybrid AI search model has driven popularity among younger users. Gemini models are being rapidly embedded across Search, YouTube, Android, and Workspace, enhancing user experience and driving internal productivity (e.g., coding, customer service).\nGoogle&rsquo;s Groundbreaking TPU\nGoogle has constructed its own chips to power AI bots. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built to dramatically accelerate machine learning (ML) tasks, especially large-scale training and inference for models like Google's Gemini, powering Search, Photos, and more, available via Google Cloud and functioning as a core component of Google&rsquo;s AI Hypercompute system.\n\nA TPU board fits into the same slot as a hard drive on the massive hardware racks inside the data centers that power Google's online services, the company says, adding that its own chips provide \"an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning\" than other hardware options. TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation.\"\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Gloud: A Consistent Growth Engine\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. In third-quarter 2025, Google Cloud revenues increased 33.5% year over year to $15.16 billion. Google&rsquo;s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics, and AI are positive. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, along with the growing number of data centers are helping Google expand its cloud footprint worldwide.\n\nAlphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA&rsquo;s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3, and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and the low-code Agent Designer tool.\nAd Business & YouTube Drive Top Line Growth\nAI is improving ad targeting and effectiveness, making the core business more resilient and profitable even with AI challengers. Meanwhile, YouTube continues to perform exceptionally well, acting as another strong pillar for revenue growth (especially the short-form video side). Zacks&rsquo; Consensus estimate sees double-digit top-line growth for the full year 2026.\n\nFuture Growth: Waymo Robotaxis\nWaymo is completing over 450,000 paid robotaxi rides per week across its operating areas, including Phoenix, LA, SF, and Austin. Reports from late 2025 indicate significant volume, a substantial increase from earlier in the year, with goals to reach 1 million weekly rides by late 2026. While I believe Tesla is poised to win the robotaxi race due to its scale and costs, there will likely not be one winner-takes-all and Waymo will have a significant chunk.\nBerkshire Hathaway Buys Alphabet\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently made a significant surprise investment, buying a $4.3 billion stake in Google's parent company, Alphabet, during the third quarter of 2025, marking a major tech bet for the value investor, likely driven by Alphabet's strong market dominance in search, its lucrative ad network, and potential in AI, despite Buffett's usual tech hesitation.\n\nGOOGL Has a Reasonable Valuation\nGoogle consistently has among the lowest P/Es among the Mag 7 stocks. With a P/E of 30x EPS, it&rsquo;s reasonably priced and unsurprising that Buffett wants a piece. Additionally, the company has about $100 billion in cash and only $20 billion in debt. The strong cash balance provides the flexibility required to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise.\nStrong Trend & Technicals\nGOOGL shares have outperformed the general market indices and trended higher all year in a stair-stepping fashion. Investors can use the intermediate 10-week moving average as a trend guide.\nBottom Line\nAlphabet remains one of the most strategically positioned companies in technology, combining dominant search economics, accelerating cloud momentum, and expanding AI-driven fundamentals.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Is Alphabet Stock a Buy for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet's stock entered 2025 at an undervalued level.\nA host of concerns were hanging over the tech giant a year ago.\nAlphabet's generative AI offerings have grown in popularity.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nFew stocks have had as successful a 2025 as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) has. It rose by around 65% for the year, and a performance like that likely won't be repeated in 2026. The question is, can we expect Alphabet's next year to be good enough to warrant owning it over other tech stocks, or the market in general?\nAlphabet answered a lot of questions in 2025 Entering 2025, Alphabet was an unloved stock. Three primary questions surrounded the company:\nWill it ever emerge as an artificial intelligence (AI) leader?\nWill Google Search maintain its dominance?\nWill Alphabet be broken up for operating an illegal monopoly?\nAll of those questions had serious implications on the perception of the stock, and it was widely believed that they wouldn't all have answers that were good for Alphabet. But that belief was wrong.\n\nIts generative AI model, Gemini, has emerged as a top option in the space and is growing in popularity. Google Search added AI Overviews and AI Mode, providing users with both traditional search results and generative AI-powered answers. This kept Google Search at the top of its niche, and there's no longer a feeling that it will be disrupted. Lastly, though the judge in Alphabet's antitrust case did find it was acting as an illegal monopoly in the online search space and used that position to hinder competition, he chose not to require the company to spin off parts of itself. Although Alphabet has to make some business changes, the judge allowed it to keep operating mostly as it has been.\nThe positive resolution of all three of these questions kick-started an impressive rally in the stock. However, a lot of its gains for the year were set up by its previous undervaluation.\nAt their low point in April, Alphabet shares could be scooped up for less than 14 times forward earnings. Even after the court case was resolved in September, Alphabet's stock could be purchased for less than 20 times forward earnings. However, today, its stock trades at about 30 times forward earnings. That's around where other big tech stocks commonly trade. While that may mean it's more fairly priced, it likely limits the level of returns that investors will see in 2026. Don't expect another 65% rise.\n\nHow will Alphabet's stock do in 2026? Shareholders will be looking for a few things from Alphabet in 2026. First, they'll want to see the continued dominance of Google Search and Gemini. Those businesses will need to keep excelling for the stock to perform well.\n\nStory Continues\nNext, investors will want to see Alphabet sell some of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to external customers. So far, it has installed all of the custom AI accelerator chips it has produced in its own data centers, where it rents them to cloud customers and uses them to support its own AI workloads. But there have been reports that it is considering a deal to sell a large number of TPUs to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . A deal like that could challenge Nvidia , with its (NASDAQ: NVDA) supremacy in graphics processing units. It would also open up a new revenue stream for the company, potentially allowing it to outperform its peers.\n\nGoogle Cloud, Alphabet's cloud computing unit, will remain a key segment to watch. It has consistently grown its revenues by 30% or more year over year, making it one of Alphabet's fastest-growing divisions. Maintaining that type of pace will be key to the company's success in 2026.\nAnother factor that could boost Alphabet's stock performance in 2026 would be a SpaceX IPO. SpaceX is rumored to be targeting a valuation of over $1 trillion when it goes public, which would make Alphabet's roughly 7% stake in the business worth in the general vicinity of $70 billion. If it chooses to sell its stake, that could provide it with a cash infusion during a critical period of its AI buildout. However, there's no guarantee that SpaceX will go public next year, nor that it will achieve (or maintain) that valuation.\n\nWhat Alphabet needs to do to have a successful 2026 is continue doing what it did in 2025. That's essentially what Wall Street thinks will happen. The analyst consensus projects 14% revenue growth in both 2025 and 2026. I think that growth in the mid-teens percentage range is a fair expectation. That would be greater than the long-term annualized performance of the S&P 500 , which makes Alphabet a solid stock pick for 2026. However, I think some other big tech stocks (like Nvidia) could outperform it. But I also think Alphabet is a safer bet to deliver outperformance, and offers a nice balance of risk and reward for investors.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

The firm is backed by billionaire Peter Thiel and headed by Tom Lee , a Wall Street forecaster known for crypto bullishness.\nThe buying has not been limited to the underlying shares. South Korean traders also sought even higher-octane exposure through T-Rex’s 2X Long BitMine Daily Target ETF, a leveraged product targeting twice the stock’s daily performance.\n\nInvestors have funneled $566 million into the ETF, which is down roughly 86% from its September peak.\nBitMine’s appeal is tied to its balance sheet. The company holds about $12 billion worth of ether, making it the largest digital-asset treasury company dedicated to ETH, according to data compiled by strategicethreserve.xyz.\nEther itself is down about 11% in 2025, according to CoinDesk market data , after the wave of listed accumulators helped push the token to a record near $5,000 in August before the rally faded.\nFor Korean retail traders, the attraction is less about stable exposure and more about convexity. Ether treasury firms trade like amplified ETH proxies, with equity risk layered on top of crypto volatility.\nThat structure creates sharp upside during momentum phases, and equally sharp drawdowns when flows reverse, but it also explains why the stock remains a magnet for South Korea’s high-risk “ant” investor base even after an 80% fall.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Is All Set to Hit a $5 Trillion Market Cap in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet is currently the third-largest company in the world and on track to benefit from the adoption of AI in multiple areas.\nAnalysts may be underestimating Alphabet's growth potential for 2026.\nThe company's stock is attractively valued right now but could trade at a premium after a year, thanks to a potential acceleration in its growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) officially became the first company in the world to hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2025. The chip giant's rise to this milestone has been deserved, as its business has been growing at a remarkable pace on the back of the fast-growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips deployed in data centers.\nHowever, a few factors have weighed on Nvidia stock since it hit that mark a couple of months ago. The chip designer has lost 8% of its value after hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29. Investors have been worried about the viability of debt-fueled AI infrastructure investments, as well as the returns that the huge spending on AI could deliver for the key names in this space.\nThe good news is that Nvidia could overcome these headwinds in 2026 and jump significantly . The stock's 12-month median price target of $250 suggests that it can rise 31% from current levels by next year, which will be enough for it to reclaim the $5 trillion market-cap level once again (it currently has a market cap of $4.64 trillion).\n\nInvestors, however, would do well to take a closer look at another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that looks all set to achieve a $5 trillion market cap in 2026 -- Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Below, I'll look at the reasons this technology giant is capable of hitting that target in the new year.\nAI is going to be a bigger catalyst for Alphabet in 2026 Alphabet is the third-largest company in the world, as of this writing, with a market cap of $3.8 trillion. The stock, therefore, needs to appreciate by another 32% to reach a $5 trillion market cap. It could easily jump by that much in the new year when you consider its full-stack approach to delivering AI tools and services to customers.\n\nWhile Nvidia is primarily in the business of selling AI chip systems powered by its graphics processing units (GPUs), Alphabet offers multiple customer-facing AI apps and tools. These include chatbots, AI-equipped search features, advertising solutions, and AI-focused cloud computing tools, powered by both in-house chips and external processors -- such as those from Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet's diversified presence across multiple AI niches means it's better positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of AI. For instance, the adoption of AI in the advertising space is anticipated to grow at 28% a year through 2033, generating almost $82 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. Additionally, the overall digital-advertising market that Alphabet serves is likely to cross $1.1 trillion in size by the end of the decade.\n\nAlphabet's AI-focused ad tools should allow it to corner a sizable chunk of this massive addressable market. That's because AI-powered advertising is helping advertisers and brands enjoy higher returns on investment. According to media audience measurement firm Nielsen, AI-enabled video ad campaigns on YouTube are driving a 17% increase in advertisers' returns.\nOther AI-enabled advertising tools from Alphabet, such as Performance Max, Broad Match, and Demand Gen, are also driving double-digit growth in advertisers' returns, apart from driving higher conversion rates when compared to manual ad campaigns. As a result, there's a strong possibility of an acceleration in Alphabet's advertising growth in the future.\nAt the same time, the Google Cloud business is gaining solid traction. That's not surprising, as Alphabet points out that customers using its Google Cloud AI solutions are witnessing a terrific average return of 727% in just three years. Businesses using its cloud AI tools can expect a payback on their investment in around eight months and witness a significant increase in employee productivity.\n\nAll this explains why Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue jumped by 34% year over year in the third quarter to $15.2 billion. That was faster than the 28% year-over-year increase in the overall cloud market's revenue in Q3, indicating that the tech giant is now gaining market share. What's more, Google Cloud's backlog increased by a whopping $49 billion on a sequential basis in the previous quarter to $155 billion.\nAs such, there's a solid chance of Alphabet's growth rate accelerating in 2026, and that should be enough for it to enter the $5 trillion club.\nWhy a $5 trillion market-cap milestone looks like a possibility Analysts are expecting a 14% increase in Alphabet's top line in 2025 to $400 billion. That's almost in line with what it reported in 2024. It's worth noting that Alphabet's revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026 have jumped higher of late.\nConsensus estimates are projecting another 14% jump in the company's top line in 2026, as evident from the chart above. However, the improving backlog in the cloud business, the growing adoption of its AI offerings such as Gemini, and the boost that advertisers are getting from Alphabet's AI tools could help it grow at a faster pace.\n\nLet's assume Alphabet's revenue growth accelerates to 20% in 2026; its top line could jump to $480 billion. If it maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 10 after a year, its market cap could get close to $5 trillion.\nOf course, you may think that Alphabet is falling slightly short of that mark. However, the market could reward it with a higher sales multiple owing to its accelerating growth, which should be enough for it to achieve the $5 trillion milestone.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Could 2026 be the year Waymo goes mainstream?\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 1:45 PM PST\n\nIn this video: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nGoogle-owned Waymo ( GOOG , GOOGL ) has big plans for 2026 , including expanding service to more cities. But it will likely face more competition too, especially from Tesla ( TSLA ). Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports on what lies ahead for Waymo.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nLet's talk about robotaxis because you think that 2026 could actually be a big year for one of Tesla's biggest competitors and that's Google's Waymo. So break down why is 2026 going to be such a big year?\n00:10 Pras\nYou know, starting off anecdotally, right? I was just in Austin, Texas for the for the holidays and they are everywhere. Waymos are everywhere, dropping people off, picking people up.\n00:20 Speaker A\nPeople are using them. It's easy.\n00:21 Pras\nYeah, I must have seen about 100 and I saw one Tesla robotaxi, right?\n00:25 Speaker A\nOh wow.\n00:25 Pras\nNow, now that's that's because\n00:26 Speaker A\n100 though. That's that's unlike what you're seeing here in the northeast.\n00:29 Pras\nWell, well not yet, right? Um so so then and then they've been in LA. I was in LA this past summer, they're all over LA. So they've really grown in the spots that they're actually operating, which is San Francisco, Phoenix, LA, Austin, and Atlanta, right? They're operating these areas without safety drivers. completely. there's no one in the car. It's just an empty car driving around. So, they're actually doing it and they're and they're charging for it, right? Uh they're going to in 2026 they're going to expand to Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Orlando with full service expected in the early 2026, and they're testing in Detroit, DC, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis.\n01:05 Pras\neven New York City, London and Tokyo, they're testing there. We'll see if that happens. But you know, very deep deeply populated urban areas that's really tough for excuse me robotaxis. So, that's happening.\n01:18 Pras\nNow, by the numbers. Uh right at the end of this year, Waymo was at 250,000 trips a week, right?\n01:24 Speaker A\nWow.\n01:25 Pras\nThey want to do an and sorry, and 20 million for the entire time they've been operating. They want to do million rides a week now by the end of the year.\n01:31 Speaker A\nNow and is this doable. Do you think they can do it?\n01:32 Pras\nSo at the end of next year. So that's four times.\n01:34 Pras\nI mean if if the if the deployments go well. Uh now you mentioned, can they do it? That's a good question because they have to increase production on their cars. They're building their their their EVs with the Jaguar I-PACE and the a Zeekr, Chinese model. But that costs money. And they don't have Tesla's ability to just crank out cars, right? So that's a potential headwind. Uh secondly, what about regulations and safety? Uh you know, sometimes some many municipalities don't want to have that. Or you have a big sort of safety issue like like Cruise did in San Francisco and that just knocks them out of the game. So those are some of the headwinds that they're facing. But\n02:04 Pras\nthat aside, 2026 could be a big year for them.\n02:07 Speaker A\nYeah, and you did mention your story that's now on Yahoo Finance's site that Tesla operates its ridehailing service with safety occupants still. And they're and only in Austin and San Francisco and that's since mid 2025. So it seems like even though there was so much excitement especially around June for Tesla's robotaxis, it seems like they're behind the game compared to Google's Waymo.\n02:24 Pras\nYeah, yeah, I mean and and the number of vehicles is actually pretty low too, right, compared to what Waymo is doing. They now Tesla says they're going to expand to to Las Vegas. I'm sorry, I'm sorry Nevada and then also Phoenix. That's the next the next spots for them. Um and then people like Ives think that's going to be 30 more markets by end of next year. I think that's overly optimistic because we haven't even heard what the next markets are. They haven't even pulled a safe driver out of the in Austin and San Francisco yet. So, a lot of big ifs there, but of course that's the sort of the big payoff if they actually do it.\n02:47 Speaker A\nRight. Wedbush's Dan Ives always bullish on Tesla, though. Pras Subramanian, thank you so much for joining me in studio. Appreciate it.\n02:51 Pras\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Ranking the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy for 2026. Here's My No. 1.\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 12:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet is the most important internet company in the world.\nThe cloud computing segment grew by more than 30%.\nAlphabet has a massive opportunity with its Tensor Processing Units.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" grouping of stocks represents seven of the biggest and most influential companies in the world that make up roughly one-third of the market cap-weighted S&P 500 . Its members have a significant impact on whether the overall stock market rises or falls in a given day, so they are closely watched by both analysts and retail investors.\n\nIn a series of articles, I've been looking at each of these companies to predict which is the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026. And while I'll reveal the full rankings later in this piece, it's time to unveil the legendary company that tops the rankings and appears to be in the best position as we head into the new year.\nLet's pull the curtain back on my No. 1 pick: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nAbout Alphabet stock Alphabet is probably still better known as Google, and for good reason. Google has an unshakable lead in global internet search, with 89.9% of the market share. The search engine in second place, Bing, has just 4.2%. And Alphabet's Chrome browser is nearly as dominant with 71.2% of the market, topping second-place Safari with 14.3%.\n\nThis means that Alphabet is unquestionably the most consequential internet company in the world. And it gives it a massive advantage, both in selling advertising and pushing content to prime locations on the web.\nAlphabet brought in $74.18 billion in revenue during the third quarter from advertising, which includes Google Search, its Google network, and YouTube. That's a 12.6% increase from a year ago, made possible by Alphabet's use of powerful AI tools. For instance, Alphabet uses AI to provide more relevant answers to search queries and also launched an AI Overviews feature that appears at the top of a search result. It also uses AI to optimize the creation and placement of advertising, and even has AI tools to help users answer their email.\n\nIn all, advertising made up 72% of Alphabet's $102.34 billion in revenue for the third quarter, helping it achieve an incredible $73.55 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.\nAlphabet is making huge strides in cloud computing As dynamic as Alphabet's advertising business is, I think the cloud computing opportunity is even greater. Google Cloud is only third by market share with 13%, trailing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, but it's seeing substantial growth. Google Cloud generated $15.15 billion in revenue in the third quarter, up 33% from a year ago. It was also responsible for $3.59 billion in operating income, up from $1.94 billion a year ago.\n\nStory continues\nFinally, Alphabet has a big opportunity with its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are its in-house alternative to Nvidia 's vaunted (and expensive) graphics processing units (GPUs). Alphabet's TPUs aren't as versatile as GPUs, but they are effective in training its AI models. Now Alphabet is reportedly discussing a deal that would sell billions of TPUs to Meta Platforms and it has a deal with Anthropic, which announced it will expand its use of Google Cloud to include up to 1 million TPUs.\n\nCoupled with Google's massive advertising business, the fast-growing cloud opportunity makes Alphabet even more formidable -- and attractive for investors as we head into 2026.\nWhy Alphabet is No. 1 Alphabet shares are up more than 60%, but the company is still reasonably priced. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29.7 remains one of the lowest in the Magnificent Seven.\nRevenue estimates for next year of $454.8 billion have climbed steadily over the last six months, as the market begins to realize the massive potential of Alphabet stock.\n\nWhile this company may not be the flashiest in the Magnificent Seven -- I would give that crown to either Nvidia or Tesla -- I think it's a no-brainer for any investor to buy right now.\nThe list in review Now we finally have the full list, in order:\nNo. 1 Alphabet is the dominant internet company on the planet and is starting to market its alternative to Nvidia GPUs.\nNo. 2 Nvidia is the largest company in the world by market capitalization and has taken the leading role in providing high-powered GPUs to data centers, powering the AI revolution.\nNo. 3 Meta Platforms shifted its attention away from the metaverse and is now focused on developing \"personal superintelligence\" through AI.\nNo. 4 Microsoft has powerful revenue streams through its cloud computing division and its profitable suite of software, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.\nNo. 5 Tesla aims to make breathtaking advancements in autonomous driving, which, if successful, will enable hundreds of thousands of Teslas to be used as robotaxis.\nNo. 6 Amazon is the globe's biggest provider of cloud computing, but is hampered by the comparatively low margins of its legacy e-commerce business.\nNo. 7 Apple isn't monetizing AI like its Magnificent Seven peers, but it's developing advanced chips to run large AI models on its products.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with any of these companies. However, I believe Alphabet is the clear winner for investors seeking to purchase a Magnificent Seven stock for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "What Are the 2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia remains the king of AI infrastructure, and its recent acquisitions only add to its strength.\nAlphabet benefits from being vertically integrated and controlling the whole tech stack.\nBoth stocks are reasonably valued given their growth rates and opportunities.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to be the biggest driving theme in the market today, and there is little reason to think that this won't continue. Demand for both AI infrastructure and services appears insatiable, and it still looks as if we're still in the very early innings of this trend.\nAgainst this backdrop, let's look at the top two AI stocks to buy right now.\n1. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king of AI infrastructure, and the company's recent acquisitions have made it even stronger. It's best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) , which provide the processing power for the majority of AI workloads. GPUs are particularly dominant in large language model (LLM) training, where the company's CUDA software platform adds to its wide moat. Nearly all foundational AI code was written on CUDA, and that code only works natively with Nvidia's chips.\n\nWith its recent acquisition of SchedMD, Nvidia has only expanded its software moat. SchedMD is the developer of Slurm, an open-source software platform that helps manage GPUs by determining which tasks they perform and when. With this acquisition, Nvidia now controls the primary orchestration platform for AI chips. While it says it will keep Slurm open-source, its control over the platform will allow it to more tightly integrate it with CUDA to offer an even more seamless experience.\nThen, on Christmas Eve, the company acquired top talent from Groq and signed a licensing agreement with the company for its technology. The deal essentially gives Nvidia access to Groq's language processing units (LPUs), which are specialized chips designed specifically for AI inference. Demand for AI inference processing is eventually expected to become larger than demand for training, so this deal can be viewed as Nvidia playing both offense and defense to get ahead of that shift.\n\nOverall, Nvidia remains the company best positioned to profit from the continued AI buildout, and its recent acquisitions only strengthen its position. The stock is also reasonably valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 25, based on analysts' estimates for its fiscal 2027, which will begin in late January 2026.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is arguably the best positioned AI company because it is the only one not reliant on Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile other companies are working on designing their own custom AI accelerator chips, Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are now in their seventh generation and have been battle-tested by running Google's workloads for more than a decade. Those years of experience aren't something that its competitors can easily emulate.\n\nAs such, the company enjoys a big structural cost advantage in both AI training (having trained its world-class AI model Gemini) and inference relative to companies that rely largely on Nvidia for chips. Its TPUs have proven so good that Anthropic signed a large deal with Alphabet to deploy TPUs to power its AI workloads. Morgan Stanley estimates that for every 500,000 TPUs that Alphabet rents out, it generates around $13 billion in revenue.\nAlphabet's other advantage over its cloud computing competitors is that it owns a world-class LLM that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. First, this lets it capture more cloud computing revenue by offering its own model. Second, it can monetize its AI model more readily by integrating it into its products, including Google Search, its Android operating systems, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and its workplace productivity tools. With lower costs for training and inference, as well as more platforms upon which it can deploy and monetize its models, Alphabet holds significant advantages over OpenAI and other LLM developers.\n\nAs the most vertically integrated AI company, Alphabet is in a strong position, and its advantages should only widen in the coming years. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, trading at a forward P/E of 28.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The Oracle of Omaha was also noted to have invented the Buffett Indicator, which assesses the valuation of the stock market by dividing the total value of US stocks with the total US GDP (gross domestic product).\n\nYahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma weighs in on how much longer the Buffett Indicator may be calling for a continued bull market, while Miramar Capital Co-Founder and senior portfolio manager Max Wasserman comments on his outlook on the AI trade when factoring in Warren Buffett's market formula.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian\nI have this story on this Buffett indicator now in Yahoo Finance and I was chuckling a little bit as I put it together because that it has been overvalued for years, uh especially the past two years and I I came away thinking this indicator, we're showing there on the screen what it's all about this Buffett indicator, could stay overvalued for more years.\n00:22 Speaker B\nBrian, we had a guest on a stocks and translation yesterday, the podcast of Yahoo Finance. And when we spoke to this guest, she was largely saying that if you take a look just at valuation over the past three years and you didn't choose to jump into the market, then you would have missed out on this three-year bull run. Many expecting that next year could be the fourth year of this bull market that we've seen so far. And so while yes, the Buffett indicator is overvalued, many are saying that this market, the valuations are too high. If you missed out over the past three years, then you missed out on this three-year run and what could be another fourth year of the bull market that we've seen. And also we're hearing so much uh from different uh outlooks for 2026 about where exactly the S&P 500, even as high as 8100 is one-year end target for 2026. And so more momentum is expected to come. And so yes, there are high valuations right now, but what we've seen over the past few few years is really these continued momentum proving that overvaluation saga wrong.\n01:21 Brian\nMax, I love this on the notes that uh you sent over to us. You said you were very cautious on the Open AI trade. And I thought, well, does that mean investors should be betting against AI stocks at this point?\n01:40 Max\nWell, I don't look at investing as betting, but I think they have to be aware of where they're going to get the returns. So, yes, I'm very cautious. We have investments in Open AI. I'm just not not in Open AI, but we have it in the Googles, the Microsofts and all this. but I would be cautious on the financing aspect of Open AI, the circular financing and given the concentration, you need to diversify the portfolio and you need to understand what you own and what happens if you're wrong. So if this trade goes south, it's going to take the indices with it. I don't think the general market again is as expensive as this concentrated part of the market. But yes, I think there's risk there and I don't think you're going to get these double triple digit returns like you have, and I think you have to go to other parts of the market. And going back to the Buffett indicator, keep in mind, that's just an indicator. He was still he's an investor in stocks, and he's telling you to really know what you're buying and don't overpay for it. That's really what he was saying by that indicator.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Google's AI Renaissance (Growth Story is Far from Over)\n\nAndrew Rocco\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGoogle Company Overview Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Alphabet ( GOOGL ) is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly accounting for roughly 90% of the online search volume and market share. Over the years, the company has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nAI Cannibalization Fears Overblown\nAlphabet’s dominant search market share and expanding cloud footprint are key growth drivers for the company. Initially, Google’s AI efforts got off to a shaky start. For instance, in Google’s first version AI model named “Bard,” searches often were completely inaccurate. Meanwhile, it appeared that ChatGPT and other models were running away with the AI race. However, several iterations later, and Google’s Gemini 2.5 AI delivers some of the most rapid responses in the industry and is viewed as an industry standard. Meanwhile, investor fears about cannibalization of the search business are unfounded. In fact, Google’s unique hybrid AI search model has driven popularity among younger users. Gemini models are being rapidly embedded across Search, YouTube, Android, and Workspace, enhancing user experience and driving internal productivity (e.g., coding, customer service).\n\nGoogle’s Groundbreaking TPU Google has constructed its own chips to power AI bots. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built to dramatically accelerate machine learning (ML) tasks, especially large-scale training and inference for models like Google's Gemini, powering Search, Photos, and more, available via Google Cloud and functioning as a core component of Google’s AI Hypercompute system. A TPU board fits into the same slot as a hard drive on the massive hardware racks inside the data centers that power Google's online services, the company says, adding that its own chips provide \"an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning\" than other hardware options. TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation.\"\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Gloud: A Consistent Growth Engine Alphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. In third-quarter 2025, Google Cloud revenues increased 33.5% year over year to $15.16 billion. Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics, and AI are positive. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, along with the growing number of data centers are helping Google expand its cloud footprint worldwide. Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA ( NVDA ) in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3, and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and the low-code Agent Designer tool.\n\nAd Business & YouTube Drive Top Line Growth AI is improving ad targeting and effectiveness, making the core business more resilient and profitable even with AI challengers. Meanwhile, YouTube continues to perform exceptionally well, acting as another strong pillar for revenue growth (especially the short-form video side). Zacks’ Consensus estimate sees double-digit top-line growth for the full year 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFuture Growth: Waymo Robotaxis Waymo is completing over 450,000 paid robotaxi rides per week across its operating areas, including Phoenix, LA, SF, and Austin. Reports from late 2025 indicate significant volume, a substantial increase from earlier in the year, with goals to reach 1 million weekly rides by late 2026. While I believe Tesla ( TSLA ) is poised to win the robotaxi race due to its scale and costs, there will likely not be one winner-takes-all and Waymo will have a significant chunk.\n\nImage Source: OurWorldinData\nBerkshire Hathaway Buys Alphabet Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently made a significant surprise investment, buying a $4.3 billion stake in Google's parent company, Alphabet, during the third quarter of 2025, marking a major tech bet for the value investor, likely driven by Alphabet's strong market dominance in search, its lucrative ad network, and potential in AI, despite Buffett's usual tech hesitation.\n\nGOOGL Has a Reasonable Valuation Google consistently has among the lowest P/Es among the Mag 7 stocks. With a P/E of 30x EPS, it’s reasonably priced and unsurprising that Buffett wants a piece. Additionally, the company has about $100 billion in cash and only $20 billion in debt. The strong cash balance provides the flexibility required to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStrong Trend & Technicals GOOGL shares have outperformed the general market indices and trended higher all year in a stair-stepping fashion. Investors can use the intermediate 10-week moving average as a trend guide.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nAlphabet remains one of the most strategically positioned companies in technology, combining dominant search economics, accelerating cloud momentum, and expanding AI-driven fundamentals.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

( BMNR ) has emerged as one of the most actively traded overseas stocks among South Korean investors this year, even as its share price has pulled back sharply from a July peak. The US-listed company, backed by billionaire Peter Thiel and led by Wall Street forecaster Tom Lee, ranks second only to Alphabet among foreign securities most favored by South Korean investors in 2025, according to data from the Korea Securities Depository.

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nInvestor attention intensified after BitMine announced a strategic pivot from Bitcoin mining to accumulating Ether, a move that pushed its shares up more than 3,000% to a peak on July 3. The stock had previously drawn limited attention but quickly became the most purchased overseas equity in South Korea during July following the shift. Since that peak, BitMine shares have declined by about 82%, yet retail demand has remained resilient. As of Dec. 29, South Korean investors had committed a net $1.4 billion into the company over the course of 2025, according to Korea Securities Depository figures, suggesting continued appetite despite elevated volatility.\n\nSome investors have sought amplified exposure through leveraged products, directing roughly $566 million into T-Rex's 2X Long BitMine Daily Target ETF, which launched after the company's summer surge and aims to deliver twice the stock's daily performance. That fund is down about 86% from its September peak. BitMine currently holds approximately $12 billion worth of Ether, making it the largest digital-asset treasury dedicated to the token, based on data from strategicethreserve.xyz. Ether itself is down about 11% in 2025 and was trading at around $2,945 on Tuesday morning in London, after momentum from listed Ether accumulators briefly pushed prices to a record near $5,000 in August before easing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

That device, which is available in South Korea to start and coming soon to the US, has two screens, two folds and a price of roughly $2,500 — about what it would cost to buy two high-end smartphones.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nTrifolds are an emerging subcategory of foldables, first attempted by Huawei Technologies Co. last year, that can take the form of both a smartphone and a widescreen tablet that’s well suited for watching videos. The convenience of having both in one gadget is supposed to overshadow the fact you could purchase both an iPhone Pro Max and iPad Pro for less.\nBut after a week of testing one of the first Galaxy Z TriFold units available in Seoul, it’s clear that this experimental phone is also held back by some unique design flaws that make it even less polished than regular — dare I say, normal — foldables. The price alone, and the engineering complexity that necessitates it, cements the device’s status as a niche item, all but ensuring it won’t resonate beyond early adopters and tech enthusiasts.\nSamsung’s latest launch is especially daring considering how little sales success it’s had in this segment. The category, which also includes models from heavyweights like Google and Huawei, still accounts for less than 2% of global phone sales, according to IDC data. Apple Inc. has so far sat out the fad, though it’s expected to release a folding iPhone in 2026. That makes the new year a pivotal time for the entire sector.\nTradeoffs Everywhere\nSamsung designed the TriFold to be folded up like a wallet, with creases splitting it into three sections when you’re holding the device in tablet mode. If the user begins to fold it incorrectly — by closing the right side before the left, for instance — the phone quickly warns them with on-screen notifications and physical vibrations. (Over a week of showing the handset to friends and colleagues, I found that most people do, in fact, initially get it wrong.)\n\nBut there’s no denying it’s sturdy. Samsung’s years of foldable engineering work show up in the TriFold’s construction. The device, which is the size of a 6.5-inch phone when shut, has zero gaps between its three sections and feels reassuringly dense and rigid in the hand. The hinges similarly exhibit the right amount of resistance and snap when opening and closing, and Samsung has slimmed every panel down to effectively the height of the necessary USB-C port.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile the phone is slimmer in most spots than the iPhone Air and many iPads, Samsung achieved that feat by pushing all the camera hardware into a large and heavy additional module. The TriFold’s back has both a camera bump and three lenses that protrude further out, undermining the broader emphasis on thinness.\nThe result is that the device feels lopsided both in the hand and when you place it on a flat surface. The fundamental premise of a foldable tablet like the TriFold is that the user gets the largest possible screen to use on the move in a pocketable form factor. But the experience is compromised when the weight is as imbalanced as it is here. The poor ergonomics made me not want to hold up the device to watch much video, even though the aspect ratio on the inner display is actually well suited for it. And it’s not as if there’s a built-in kickstand to give the user a break.\nThe 10-inch interior screen is also more prone to glare and reflections than other smartphone displays. Oppo's Find N5 foldable from earlier this year is vastly superior in this respect, proof that it’s possible to do better even with a flexible panel.\nMaking matters worse is some poor camera performance. Low-light photos appear grainy and dull, lacking the sharpness achieved by even midrange Android smartphones such as the $630 Xiaomi 17 or $799 Google Pixel 10. Samsung threw in additional selfie cameras on the big inner screen — which makes sense for video calls — as well as on the exterior. The latter is superfluous since the handset can already use the main camera in concert with the outside screen.\n\nAnother issue stems from the semi-circular bumps at the top and bottom of each hinge, which interfere with multitasking gestures when you’re using the screen in landscape mode. They also make swiping to the side in portrait mode awkward.\nSamsung also hasn’t solved a problem that’s endemic to foldables: the visible crease that occurs where the screen bends. Because the TriFold folds in two places, it has two such creases, and they remain apparent. While they’re more subtle from certain angles when the screen is on, you’ll always feel the creases as you’re swiping around. For all the improvements that Samsung and rivals like Huawei have made, this lingering design flaw presents a challenge to selling such devices at sky-high prices: That segment of the consumer market rarely accepts compromises.\n\nBut tradeoffs and imperfections define the experience of using the Galaxy Z TriFold. Samsung swaps the typical fingerprint sensor embedded in the display for one built into the power button on the side. It’s slower, less precise and less comfortable to use than what the vast majority of Android phones offer, including Samsung’s more conventional handsets. The folding design also precluded Samsung from putting the speakers on the sides, which means they offer less stereo separation than you’d get on a dedicated tablet.\n\nThe TriFold’s advantages over a regular handset — the large 10-inch display and good-for-a-smartphone audio quality — would be better served by an outsized battery to power them. Instead, the rather modest 5,600 milliampere-hour battery can trigger the smartphone equivalent of range anxiety, forcing users to choose between using the device as intended or conserving power. Gaming and video playback are particularly draining: Any extensive sessions are often cut short by battery depletion warnings that more conventional smartphones wouldn’t succumb to until hours later.\nIn comparison, recent Chinese flagships like Xiaomi Corp.’s 17 Pro Max and Oppo’s Find X9 Pro both offer bigger 7,500mAh batteries, offering consumers a reason to consider sticking with conventional non-folding phones.\nRecharging speeds are also slower compared with the Chinese competition. Samsung has equipped the TriFold with 45-watt wired and 15-watt wireless charging, while Vivo’s non-folding X300 Pro, for example, reaches 90 watts wired and 40 watts wirelessly, and has a larger battery to boot.\n\nWith this phone, Samsung made an attempt to optimize the software to take advantage of the larger screen. Using the company’s DeX software, which has been tweaked for this particular hardware type, you can also run a desktop-like experience directly on the large inner display. (Other Samsung phones must be plugged into an external monitor to activate DeX mode.) In DeX, the TriFold can operate as many as four distinct workspaces that can each run five apps simultaneously.\nBeyond that, the software experience feels half-baked, and not fully tailored for this new hardware type. Popular apps like Instagram are not all optimized, with Instagram Reels displaying in only one half of the screen when viewed in landscape. Meanwhile, the ability to run apps side by side has been standard on foldable devices for years, and is still of limited utility, so Samsung only deserves modest credit for implementing it here.\n\nSamsung has added the ability to start an activity on the exterior display and continue it on the inside by opening the TriFold to reveal the larger screen. However, that trick doesn’t work in reverse. For example, after picking a destination on Google Maps with the device open, the user can’t simply close the device and still see the route on the smaller screen.\nThe foldable proposition has always been reminiscent of the one that Apple offered with the original iPhone: pay an exceptionally high price and accept worse durability and battery life for the privilege of a futuristic design with a much larger screen. The problem for foldables is that standalone tablets already offer bigger displays at a much lower cost with very few design tradeoffs.\n\nSamsung’s pricey Galaxy Z TriFold doesn’t advance the foldable category in a meaningful way, serving mainly to underscore how great the engineering and design challenges are. Even more basic foldables, such as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, have only just begun to offer user experiences that come close to matching conventional smartphones.\nAdding an extra crease to a device for the sake of innovating and maximizing screen real estate means those devices will, for now, be more expensive and less refined. The adventurous shoppers keen to try out a first-generation foldable device will be better served waiting to see what Apple has to offer when it makes its long-awaited debut in this space.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Cipher Mining's AI/HPC Expansion Takes Shape: Is the Shift Paying Off?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:54 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CIFR\n\nWULF\n\nIREN\n\nGOOG\n\nCipher Mining ’s CIFR AI and high-performance computing (HPC) expansion is clearly taking shape, supported by long-term contracts, visible execution and a rapidly scaling pipeline that reshapes the company’s growth profile.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, Cipher Mining executed two landmark AI/HPC transactions that strengthened its revenue visibility. The company signed two landmark hosting agreements — a 10-year AI hosting deal with Fluidstack, backed by Google, and a 15-year direct hyperscaler lease with Amazon Web Services (AWS). These agreements collectively establish Cipher Mining as a credible HPC infrastructure developer and lock in roughly $8.5 billion of contracted AI/HPC lease payments, with revenues expected to commence in 2026.\n\nExecution risk has been a key concern in miner-to-HPC transitions, but Cipher Mining’s recent progress suggests the shift is advancing smoothly. In the reported quarter, the company highlights that construction at the Barber Lake site is already underway, with engineering, procurement and long-lead equipment secured and delivery of 168 MW of critical IT load targeted for late 2026. Importantly, Cipher Mining grew its contracted AI hosting capacity from zero to 544 MW in a single quarter, while maintaining a 3.2 GW development pipeline extending through 2029 and beyond.\n\nWhile AI revenues will ramp primarily from 2026 onward, Cipher Mining’s secured hyperscaler contracts, advancing buildouts and prudent capital structure suggest the change is moving beyond promise to reflection. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 15.69% revenue growth in 2026 underscores expectations for accelerating contribution from the company’s expanding AI/HPC platform.\n\nCIFR's Key Competitors in the AI/HPC Space IREN Limited IREN competes with CIFR through a more aggressive, GPU-centric strategy. IREN is building a large-scale GPU cloud platform, led by a $9.7 billion Microsoft contract and expanding relationships with Together AI, Fluidstack and Fireworks AI, announced during the first quarter of fiscal 2026. These deals support IREN’s expectations of over $500 million in AI Cloud ARR by early fiscal 2026 and a roadmap toward 140,000 GPUs powering multi-billion-dollar ARR potential.\n\nTeraWulf WULF is emerging as an AI/HPC competitor to CIFR through a long-term joint venture with Fluidstack, positioning TeraWulf as a power-first, infrastructure-centric provider for high-density compute. The joint venture targets long-duration contracts and is valued at $9.5 billion over 25 years. However, TeraWulf’s 250-500 MW annual expansion is largely back-end loaded, with most capacity unlikely to be online before 2026. This timeframe overlaps with CIFR's growth plans, intensifying competition as both target the same wave of hyperscaler and AI infrastructure demand.\n\nStory Continues\nCIFR’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimate Cipher Mining shares have risen steeply by 207.7% in the past six-month period, outperforming the Zacks Technology Services industry’s gain of 20.9%. However, the broader Zacks Business Services sector declined 7.8% in the same time frame.\nCIFR’s Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCIFR shares are overvalued, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 21.15X compared with the industry’s 2.73X. CIFR has a Value Score of F.\nCIFR’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor the full year 2026, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss is currently pegged at 88 cents per share, and remains unchanged over the past 30 days. CIFR reported a loss of 36 cents per share on a year-over-year basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCipher Mining currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Warren Buffett is retiring — here's what his favorite indicator reveals about the stock market\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nIt's time for one final check in with the investing GOAT's favorite stock market indicator before he rides off into the sunset.\nBerkshire Hathaway ( BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett , 95, will hand over the reins to his hand-picked successor Greg Abel on Wednesday.\nThe official passing of the torch caps a storied career for Buffett, which included buying a major US railroad (Burlington Northern), striking up a friendship with Microsoft ( MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates, and offering up scores of pithy comments in annual shareholder letters.\n\n“Berkshire’s culture is pretty simple,” Howard Buffett told me in a 2024 episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (listen below). “You do what you say you’re going to do, and you do it when you say you’re going to do it. You’re honest about it. You make mistakes and you accept responsibility for those mistakes.”\nHoward is in line to succeed his father as Berkshire chairman.\n\nThrough it all, Buffett championed the art of value investing, as taught to him by mentor Benjamin Graham. The philosophy is rooted in an unwillingness to overpay for investments.\nThe \"Buffett Indicator\" takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual US GDP. It rose to fame following a 2001 Fortune Magazine article written by Buffett and longtime Fortune writer and Buffett insider Carol Loomis.\n\n\"The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know,\" Buffett explained in the article. \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"\nThe indicator is at valuation levels never seen before, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. It suggests that stocks are long overdue for a healthy pullback in early 2026.\nPicking apart the numbers, the Buffett Indicator stands at about 221.4% — up a sharp 22% from April 30, per data from GuruFocus. The indicator has never been at a higher level dating back to the earliest data from GuruFocus in 1970.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) has shot up nearly 17% on the year amid major optimism surrounding the earnings potential of AI-related companies and the effect the technology will have on profits. Analysts in turn have scrambled to upwardly revise their profit forecasts on companies, supporting higher stock prices.\nFor his part, Buffett has bet on the AI future by maintaining stock investments in Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and more recently, Alphabet ( GOOGL ).\nWherever the stock market goes from here, one thing can't be questioned: Buffett's impact on investing.\n\nStory Continues\n\"I think Warren Buffett's the GOAT of capitalism,\" Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me on Opening Bid (video above) in October. \"There's so much guidance and wisdom that we've had from Warren over the years.\"\nBerkshire purchased Brooks in 2006. Each year at the storied Berkshire annual shareholder meeting, Brooks makes special edition sneakers with the face of Buffett as well as his longtime business partner Charlie Munger .\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing.

      "Content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned -0.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.04 indicates a change of +4.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $94.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.9%.

      "Content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this company have returned -0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 points to a change of +31.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.04 indicates a change of +4.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $94.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15.9%. The $340.26 billion and $390.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.3% and +14.7%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Alphabet reported revenues of $87.47 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.3%. EPS of $2.87 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.95%. The EPS surprise was +26.99%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street Journal stated the sale is worth over $2 billion.Manus, a Singapore based subsidiary of Beijing Butterfly Effect Technology Ltd., launched an AI agent that surpassed OpenAI's DeepResearch system earlier this year. The agent is a digital assistant that can study, automate, and decide without much input.Meta wants to sell and run the Manus AI agent after the purchase and incorporate its technology into Meta AI, WhatsApp, and business productivity applications. The purchase highlights Meta's ambition to commercialize generative AI for consumer and corporate applications.Meta invested in Scale AI earlier this year, valuing the U.S. data-labeling startup at $29 billion and extending partnership with CEO Alexandr Wang. Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft are acquiring and hiring AI experts to bolster their portfolios.Chinese AI businesses are increasingly seeking operational independence from geopolitical difficulties, as Manus did in Singapore.

( NVDA , Financials ) investing $20 billion in AI inference business Groq shows its desire to dominate the AI ecosystem. Groq may continue operating independently while Nvidia uses its inference tools thanks to its founder Jonathan Ross and several engineers.Nvidia's planned diversification beyond AI training hardware is shown by the deal. Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPUs fuel most large-scale model training, but the company is now targeting inference, which has a far larger and recurring revenue potential.Over 90% of the AI GPU market is Nvidia. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq protects market dominance and adds software and service income streams while Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft construct their own inference processors to save costs.AI applications increase inference workloads considerably. AI token usage at major tech businesses increases every few months, fueling inference hardware and platform demand, say analysts. Beyond inference, Nvidia is entering networking, robotics, and government. Last quarter, networking sales surged 162% to $8.2 billion, while automotive and professional visualization grew double digits.Nvidia's Strong Buy consensus has 39 Buys and one Hold rating with an average price target of $263.58, implying 40% upside over a year. To balance chip sales with long-term software, cloud, and inference revenue growth, Nvidia's Groq acquisition boosts its full-stack AI platform transition.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI Trade’s Next Leg Is All About Tech’s ‘Pick-and-Shovel’ Stocks\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBTC-USD\n\nVRT\n\nSNDK\n\nAPH\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The artificial intelligence trade is moving, and investors seeking cutting-edge ways to play it are snapping up technology “pick-and-shovel” stocks as massive cloud service providers pour billions into new data centers.\nData storage companies dominated the S&P 500 Index in 2025, with Sandisk Corp. shares soaring almost 580% to make them the benchmark’s best performer, with Western Digital Corp. in second and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc in fourth. Meanwhile, AI-linked power providers and cable and fiber producers such as Amphenol Corp., Corning Inc., NRG Energy Inc. and GE Vernova Inc. were among the Top 25.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nThat’s a shift from the last few years, when Nvidia Corp. — the original AI pick-and-shovel company — was entrenched among the top stocks in the S&P 500. The chip giant gained 40% in 2025, making it the 71st best performer in the index this year. While Nvidia and cloud hyperscalers Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are still powering the market due to their sheer size, their percentage gains have started to wane.\n“When the benchmarks are fairly concentrated, it’s important to look for themes that are gonna drive sales and earnings growth,” said Jake Seltz, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “AI is kind of one of those dominant themes right now, that’s nothing new. So we’re just looking, broadening our horizons beyond tech.”\n\nInvestors can find room to grow and better valuations by buying into the next wave of companies that are set to benefit from the billions of dollars hyperscalers are spending to build data centers.\n“What we are focused on are the picks and shovels of where that money is being spent,” said Matt Sallee, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which doesn’t own shares of any hyperscalers. “The chips to a degree, but more so some of the names that you haven’t really heard of.”\nOf course, there are some fears on Wall Street that the spending could slow, reversing gains in stocks tied to AI. It’s similar to what happened during the pandemic, when demand for basic home health products took off.\n“Covid hit and this world needed way more face masks, hand sanitizer, all those things,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management. But within six to 12 months there was a glut, and “those businesses that supplied those things went from the best times ever to the absolute worst times ever.”\nStill, investors remain bullish on the AI trade as the hyperscalers keep pledging to spend. Here’s what investors are buying now to play the tech infrastructure buildout.\n\nStory Continues\nData Storage\nWall Street expects data storage to remain hot in 2026 after Sandisk, Western Digital and Seagate surged in 2025. However, the boom times for this year’s winners may be coming to an end. For example, the average analyst price target for Sandisk in 2026 is $264, which would be a roughly 8% gain from where it currently sits at around $244.\n\nAnalysts see much bigger upside in a company like Pure Storage Inc., which is trading for $68 but is projected to reach $94 in 2026, a 38% leap. Other digital storage shares tied to AI include NetApp Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc.\nConstruction and Power\nA range of stocks associated with building and powering data centers are expected to keep running. Quanta Services Inc., which provides specialized contracting for utilities and telecommunications companies, is a top pick for Tortoise Capital’s Sallee. Other contractors include MYR Group Inc., Primoris Services Corp. and MasTec Inc.\nCompanies involved in wiring are also popular. They include Amphenol, which designs and manufactures high-speed fiber and copper interconnect solutions used in data centers, and Emcor Group Inc., which does mechanical and electrical construction. Other power infrastructure names include Vistra Corp., Constellation Energy Corp., GE Vernova and Generac Holdings Inc., which makes backup generators.\n\nBitcoin Miners\nBitcoin miners represent a potential “total revaluation story” as they pivot toward powering data centers and away from mining the cryptocurrency, according to Sallee.\n“They have the electricity already, they’ve had it for five-plus years to produce Bitcoin,” he said. “They’re going to redirect that electricity to higher-value, long-term contracts for high performance computing hosting.”\nNames in this area include Bitdeer Technologies Group, whose shares jumped in October after the company announced plans to move further into AI. Shares of IREN Ltd., Cipher Mining Inc., Riot Platforms Inc. and WhiteFiber Inc. have also received a boost from the companies’ intentions to convert to high-performance computing data centers.\nHeating and Cooling\n\nData centers require specialized precision controlled heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, creating demand for the companies that make them. Vertiv Holdings Co., which provides power systems and cooling solutions for data centers, is up 46% in 2025 and remains a stock to watch. Eaton Corp., another power management firm, overlaps with Vertiv but is less of a pure play, according to Seltz.\nOther names in the space include Comfort Systems USA Inc., which provides heating ventilation and air conditioning system installation and maintenance, as well as water providers Xylem Inc., Ecolab Inc. and American Water Works Co.\nSoftware\nSome investors with longer time horizons are looking to software as future beneficiaries of AI as large language models improve and more applications are built.\n\n“Investors are, I think, naturally inclined to look for companies that have cheaper valuations with terrific magnitude of growth that are potentially gonna really benefit from the application of AI,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha.\nSoftware stocks have generally underperformed this year, with the S&P 500 Software Industry Index rising 12% in 2025 compared with a 17% gain in the overall benchmark. But that has made the stocks’ valuations more appealing.\n“I don’t think those stories are dead,” said Allspring’s Seltz, who is watching names such as Snowflake Inc., Datadog Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. “It feels like it might be a little early, but the stocks do look attractive.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Could Be Among the First to Reach a $5 Trillion Valuation\n\nThomas Niel, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points In October, Nvidia's market cap briefly topped $5 trillion.\nWhile that particular \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has since pulled back, another member could join the $5 trillion club this year.\nGoogle parent Alphabet currently has a market capitalization of $3.8 trillion.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nBack in October, Nvidia became the first company with a market cap exceeding $5 trillion.\nNvidia's stock has since pulled back from that lofty level, but one big rally might be all it takes to lift the AI chip giant back above that value in 2026. Not only that, a few other companies could join that exclusive club, too.\nFor instance, as my fellow Motley Fool contributor Harsh Chauhan noted in an article on Dec. 20, Microsoft could conceivably hit that market cap milestone in the coming year .\nIn my view, another \" Magnificent Seven \" member also looks to be on the verge of joining the $5 trillion club: Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nWhy Alphabet is so close to hitting this milestone Alphabet shares have surged by 65% year to date. The primary reason for this has been the company's success in catching up to early adopters of generative artificial intelligence (AI) like Microsoft and OpenAI. Alphabet's Gemini 3 has given ChatGPT a run for its money.\nMore importantly, the AI Overviews and AI Mode features on the Google search engine have helped to increase user engagement with the platform. This has alleviated investors' initial concerns that the growing use of AI chatbots to answer people's questions would cut into Alphabet's primary profit center, search advertising.\n\nThanks to this year's significant share price run-up, Alphabet now has a market cap of $3.8 trillion. That means all it'll take for the company to reach a $5 trillion market cap is for it to appreciate in value by another 31.6%. Not only is that well within the realm of possibility in the next few years, there's a chance it could happen between now and next December. It all has to do with near-term earnings growth, coupled with the potential for the stock to experience further valuation expansion.\nCould it happen next year? According to sell-side analysts' estimates, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) could rise by over 41% between now and the end of 2028. This strongly suggests that it's a matter of when, not if, Alphabet will join the $5 trillion club.\nHowever, a move to that market cap could arrive as soon as 2026. Yes, the average sell-side analyst's earnings forecast may only call for 6% EPS growth next year, but those predictions may be too conservative. Even as Alphabet plans to ramp up spending on AI and cloud infrastructure, the payoff from these investments could take shape sooner than expected.\n\nStory Continues\nIn fact, we may already be witnessing this: Google's overall queries and revenue are growing by double-digit percentages thanks to AI integration. The sell-side forecasts at the high end of the range call for earnings growth of as much as 24% in 2026. Even if growth lands somewhere between the average and high end of the forecast range, that may lift the stock price by enough to get the company over the $5 trillion mark.\n\nShares currently trade for around 28 times expected forward earnings. If high growth persists into the coming year and bullishness about AI returns, names like Microsoft could again trade at forward P/Es in the mid-30s, and Alphabet could experience a similar rerating. Considering its plausible path to a $5 trillion market cap, Alphabet may be one of the first stocks investors should buy for the new year.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Ron DeSantis (R) said that Washington state’s fiscal outlook took a significant hit after Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) founder Jeff Bezos relocated from the state to Florida in late 2023.\n\nTaxpayers ‘Flee’ Due To Bad Policies On Sunday, in a post on X, DeSantis said that the state of Washington had “lost its biggest taxpayer,” referring to Bezos’ recent move to Florida.\nAccording to DeSantis, this single relocation of a billionaire entrepreneur has resulted in “a major impact” on Washington’s state budget.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\nFrom Moxy Hotels to $12B in Real Estate — The Firm Behind NYC's Trendiest Properties Is Letting Individual Investors In.\n\nWhile he didn’t mention any specific figures, Bezos’ move to his infamous “billionaire bunker” in the exclusive Indian Creek Village community outside of Miami in 2024 reportedly helped him save $1 billion in taxes . This is a considerable figure given Washington state’s annual revenue of $66.39 billion from 2023 through 2025.\nThis comes amid Washington’s plans for a new state income tax on its millionaire residents, which DeSantis said would be “counterproductive,” since it hands states that don’t have an income tax, such as Florida, “a major advantage over states that do.”\n“Washington has already driven taxpayers out due to bad policies,” he said, adding that the inevitable result of such bad policies is that “taxpayers will flee.”\n\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\nHe warned that states will continue spending, and eventually, what began as a tax on millionaires will expand to the rest of the tax base. “This will further erode the economic base — and the cycle will keep repeating,” he said in conclusion.\n\nStory Continues\nNeither Bezos nor the State of Washington immediately responded to Benzinga’s request for a comment on this matter. The story will be updated as soon as we receive a response.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nBillionaires Plan Exit From California Amid New Wealth Tax Other states, such as California, are headed in a similar direction, with a new proposal for a wealth tax on the state’s billionaires, called the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act.\nAccording to the proposal, a one-time levy of 5% would be imposed on all state residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion, with stiff penalties for understating wealth, and additional measures to prevent evasion among the state’s 200 billionaire residents.\n\nBillionaire investor Peter Thiel and Alphabet Inc.

      "Content": "Meta to Acquire Manus in $2 Billion Bet on AI Agents\n\nKurt Wagner, Luz Ding and Lulu Yilun Chen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:18 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTCEHY\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nCRM\n\nNOW\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to buy Manus, a popular Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, in its effort to build a business around its massive AI investment.\nThe deal values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a rare US acquisition of an Asian tech company and the latest multibillion-dollar AI bet from Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The agreement was struck in about 10 days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are not public.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nMeta intends to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating it into its products, it said in a statement. Backed by some of China’s biggest names like Tencent Holdings Ltd., ZhenFund and HSG, Manus shot to prominence early this year not long after DeepSeek’s debut. All of its existing investors have been bought out in Meta’s takeover, one of the people said.\n“There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson said. Manus' parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\n\nZuckerberg has made AI his company’s top priority, and is spending billions to hire researchers, build data centers and develop new models. Manus had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year from selling its AI agent to businesses via subscriptions, which could give Meta a more immediate return on some of its AI spending\nThe Manus AI agent can complete a handful of general tasks, such as screening resumes, creating trip itineraries and analyzing stocks in response to basic instructions. Butterfly Effect raised money earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in an investment round led by US venture capital firm Benchmark.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nMeta's purchase of Manus is likely aimed at expanding the former's AI agent task capabilities, as it currently lacks applications built on its own foundation model compared to a broader application ecosystem for ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. While the deal marks an early step for Meta to build a subscription and API business around its AI investment, it could draw regulatory scrutiny given that Singapore-based Manus was founded in China.\n\nStory Continues\n— Mandeep Singh and Robert Biggar, BI analysts\nAI agents are tools that don’t need human supervision to perform specific digital tasks. Enterprise software companies such as Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. have heavily promoted their versions of agents as the most effective way for businesses to use the emerging technology, rather than generative AI features such as chatbots, which require user prompts and interaction.\n\nMeta already has an AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available through the company’s social media and messaging platforms — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — in addition to its AI glasses. The US company is acquiring the technology and leadership group from Manus, though its statement didn’t detail where the new team will sit within the organization. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the deal’s value, said Manus co-founder and CEO Xiao Hong will report to Javier Olivan, chief operating officer of Meta, citing people familiar with the acquisition.\nAlexandr Wang, Meta’s Chief AI Officer who joined this summer as part of a high-profile investment into his startup, welcomed the Manus team of about 100 staff with a post on X. In his own message on the platform, Manus’ Xiao said that the deal would help his company expand the reach of its agents. “The era of AI that doesn’t just talk, but acts, creates, and delivers, is only beginning,” he wrote. “And now, we get to build it at a scale we never could have imagined.”\n\nMeta’s aggressive spending to compete in the AI race is matched by rivals like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. Zuckerberg has pledged to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure projects over the next three years, many of them expected to be AI-related. The company has hired an expensive team of researchers to develop a new state-of-the-art AI model it plans to debut next spring, and has faced some skepticism from investors who worry that the heavy spending won’t result in meaningful revenue anytime soon.\nVC firm Benchmark was criticized earlier this year by lawmakers and other venture investors for backing an AI company with ties to China. “Who thinks it is a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me,” US Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, wrote in a post on X in May. Benchmark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Meta deal Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the deal during a regular press briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday referred reporters to relevant regulatory agencies without elaborating.\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Philip Glamann.\n(Updates with Meta comment in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.\nBuy the \"Mag 7\" Hyperscalers Or Are They Spending Too Much?\nAlthough they are among the world&rsquo;s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\n\nThis includes Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\nThere is no doubt that &ldquo;hyperscaling&rdquo; is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns\nNotably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billio\nROIC Comparison\nWith Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market&rsquo;s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\n\nAmazon&rsquo;s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance\nMagnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon&rsquo;s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon&rsquo;s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts\nAmazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500&rsquo;s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Motley Fool Money starts now.\nFrom Fool Global headquarters, this is Motley Fool Money. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise another $100 billion. Give or take at a give or take valuation of about $800 billion. This comes after Greg Brockman, one of their co-founders, said that the company had to make trade-offs about whether it had enough compute to build the next model or whether it was going to serve ChatGPT. The question is, how long can they keep raising money without having a profitable business model, Lou? That seems like a fundamental tension, and these numbers are getting absolutely enormous.\n\nLou Whiteman: Yeah, no, you're asking the right question, and I don't know if any of us know the answer, and that's the scary thing. Just for fun, I asked AI, \"How much money is there in the world?\" It depends on what OpenAI needs, but it feels like AI is going to just swallow everything right now. Look, here's the problem. OpenAI doesn't have the cash-generating machine that Meta has, that Microsoft has, that Alphabet has. That is turning into a significant disadvantage here. All these companies are doing amazing thing. Remember, at the beginning of OpenAI, when we just marveled at this tool, and we're like, wow, this is magic. But now Gemini is giving me that magic. Everybody's giving me that magic.\n\nStory Continues\nTravis Hoium: People are baking is spending $20 a month to get magic in their pocket.\nLou Whiteman: Right. Frankly, I'm one of those people. I'm having fun with AI. I'm exploring AI, but I'm not going to buy seven different models for this. They needed the WOW factor before. If the WOW factor is rolling off and they still need all of this money, I don't know where they go from here. We're seeing pushbacks all over the place. This is a real question. At some point, they need to get their financial house in order and figure out, either as Greg said, how to do more with less or what compromises they have to make here.\n\nTravis Hoium: How do you think about this tension? We'll get to the stocks. I want to ask specifically about some of the companies that public market investors may or may not have some exposure to, but how do you think about this business that seems to be holding trillions of value in public markets up right now. Should we be worried about their business model, or should it just be about pushing the frontier forward with artificial intelligence as far and as fast as possible?\nAsit Sharma: I think we should keep an eye on the business model. OpenAI made some really consequential choices which serve them well in the last few years. As Lou mentioned, the explosion of interest we had in generative AI and how the world has changed. It's really due to OpenAI stepping up and pouring so much money into its frontier models. And at the beginning, those models were meant to be everything for everyone. But as time goes on, I think it's become more important that these big models can't be Swiss Army knives. They're simply not. You have to focus at some point on your markets and how you're going to monetize. Interestingly enough, competitor Anthropic has openly said, \"Look, we're focusing on the enterprise market. We're not out to get the most retail customers. We see some profit here with deep-pocketed enterprise businesses, so that's where we're focusing our model.\"\n\nTravis Hoium: That's specifically coding. That's where they have been ahead of the game. It was probably a month ago now when Gemini 3 came out, that beat all benchmarks. It did not beat Anthropics Claude on some of the coding benchmarks, which then they even took another step further beyond that. But that does seem like if a mode is building in this business from a model standpoint, Anthropic does have the focus to be able to do that.\nAsit Sharma: Yeah, in fact, I saw an interesting note on a Reddit thread, some developers the other day, which said, \"Okay, if you're prototyping something, maybe go to ChatGPT for the architecture conversation.\" Go to Gemini for the implementation of it, but go to Sonnet or Opus for the coding of it. You hit this on the head, Travis, that all of these models now are getting better in certain parts, but to be dominant in every category is not something the other businesses still want to chase. OpenAI almost seems like it has to, but of course, they're talking now about making the appropriate trade-offs. To me, that means they're going to have to focus on that big wide funnel of the hundreds of millions of users that are avidly going to ChatGPT and talking to it every day and figure out how to get conversational commerce going. Move in that direction, you have to understand over the long-term, the cost of your compute, and how you can reasonably sell it. It's a really simple equation eight now. They still haven't figured it out.\n\nTravis Hoium: They do seem to be leaning more toward that consumer side rather than the enterprise, they're not a hyperscaler themselves. Do they have to get into something like advertising or is a new business model, and we see this on the Internet? New business models come up when new technologies come around. Advertising does seem to be the thing that's a common thread here between all technologies. You can go back to television, radio. Now we're on the Internet, where it's all about advertising, and that's how you take away that pain point of somebody actually have to pay for something to watch a football game, for example. But that's fundamentally how they make the business work. Do they have to figure that out, or can they be a consumer company and do something else to make money?\n\nAsit Sharma: They can't be a consumer company and do something else to make money and expect the types of margins that investors want at these valuation rounds. At the end of the day, they'll have to get margin for somewhere to make the latest entrance, the people are coming in with the next tens of billions into the hundreds of billions of investment into OpenAI, to make that payout worth it for them to raise more capital. I think behind the scenes, sure, they're talking about how they pull advertising in. We can already see from the partnerships that company is making to bring brands into their funnel, Shopify is one that this is absolutely where they're headed. Now, the other stuff that they're exploring some of it even sketchy, a G-rated show, so I won't get into it. But some of that they'll be at the margins, other ways they can monetize the consumer.\n\nLou Whiteman: Every business that we discuss that has margin almost in this space when we think about Clouds, it comes down to that. Alphabet with YouTube, Meta with any number of its advertising properties, Netflix , so on.\nTravis Hoium: Lou, the impact on public markets, obviously, OpenAI isn't public. It's possible that they will IPO. You would think if you're raising money at $800 billion valuation, eventually those investors are going to want liquidity. That means going to the public markets. But the companies that are public, Oracle, CoreWeave, Nebius, these have been the hot names in AI. But they've all dropped precipitously, and they're the ones that are actually funding the acquisition of Nvidia chips. We talked about circular financing, but there is a circular almost business model here and financing model here that is starting to impact these public companies negatively. Is that something that we should be concerned about with OpenAI at the core?\n\nLou Whiteman: We should be watching it. I think it's the same question, though. All of this makes sense if it ends up making sense.\nTravis Hoium: It works until it doesn't.\nLou Whiteman: If there is a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, none of this is a problem. I think the question is, and what you guys are getting at is that, is there a pot of gold at the end of OpenAI's rainbow, and how do they get there? I think if nothing else, it's time to differentiate. It's time to not paint the entire sector with one brush and say, \"AI, good, which every trend, every innovation we've had has had winners and losers.\" The question for OpenAI is back to what you're saying, consumer, business, whatever. Right now, they're in a position where they need to look for revenue. Wherever they can find it, and they need to look for investment wherever they can find it because they need a lot of money. They need more money than any one single source can do it. I respect that everything is on the table. However, just because they might be doing what they should, I don't know if that guarantees success.\n\nTravis Hoium: Yeah, do you have thoughts on whether these companies? Are they building a house of cards? Is this a new phenomenal business model building data centers that we just haven't seen before? Where's its head at?\nAsit Sharma: I think long-term, the investment in data centers is needed, and some companies are going to have some rough times in the future as demand and supply normalize. Whether that's three years from today or five years from today, or we read the tea leaves much sooner, and those companies get punished. I don't know about those time frames, but everything that we're seeing today is predicated a lot of it. Let's not say everything. A lot of it is predicated on what Sam Altman thought a few years ago, that the more of compute that we throw with these models, the better they'll get at different tasks and so we need to invest lots and lots of money to make way for that compute. Nvidia played into that. Jensen Huang is a firm believer in that. There's some proof in the pudding in that as we use these models and ask them to reason more, that entails more compute. But we've totally avoided the other side of the conversation, which is, how do we make this stuff more energy efficient? How do we make on the algorithmic side, this stuff more efficient? How do we make on the development of the models, this side, all of this more efficient? By avoiding those conversations, we're setting up a future in which it has to be like boom or bust for some companies. They're going to win on that big scaling model. That's where OpenAI has thrown its chips. There'll be lots of little players, too, smaller players who don't need all of that power, and I think something you want to talk about, Travis, is maybe Gemini's smaller models. Those are interesting and we can go there if there's time.\n\nTravis Hoium: Yeah, I want to get to that next. We need to take a quick break. We will get to the recovery of Alphabet in 2025. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nLou Whiteman: Yeah, what a year it's been for Alphabet. The thing that they're reaping benefit from today is a lot of work that they did years ago.\nAsit Sharma: There were some discussions, I think the Investment Community, maybe last year, the year before that, look, Alphabet ought to be able to catch up because it has deep expertise. In fact, Google scholars were the ones who came up with transformer technology that we're all riding off of today. But I would have been surprised if you told me that at the beginning of the year. How is it doing it? It's not having to focus again with these huge scaling laws as OpenAI has done, and they've made those choices. Alphabet has really deep expertise in smaller models, and they have the very deep pockets to go ahead and experiment and play around. You sent out a tweet and an image to me and Lou this week, which was basically discussing how good Gemini Flash 3 is. This is a smaller model from Gemini in terms of cost and compute efficiency. I'm not going to get into all the details here, except to say that and the 2.5 model from Gemini are really efficient. You point out one 10th the cost. Now, you have to keep in mind, you're probably referring to developers who are using the API, but still let's go there. Maybe a 10th the cost of, say, OpenAI and some of its competitors. What it does, it gives you a lot more intelligence for less money. If I could boil it all down. You may not want a genius level intelligence, but what if you want reasonably good intelligence for something that's sufficient, they've provided that.\n\nTravis Hoium: Let's give an example there. Duolingo was one of OpenAI's biggest users, maybe even their biggest user of their API. The example there would be if you have a conversation with their advanced plan, you can have a conversation in a different language, and the AI we'll talk back to you. We'll have a conversation as you learn a language. That conversation maybe a tenth of the cost coming out out of this Gemini model versus a comparable OpenAI model. Is that the way to think about it? Now as the companies are going, how do we make money on this? That becomes a big piece of the equation?\nAsit Sharma: I think so. It's slightly beyond my pay grade. I will say this the way I think of it myself is if you're a smaller developer and you've got a database, and you need to use the AI to develop a conversational bot, it is a lot cheaper for you to run that through Geminis model. What it costs you per token, you get so much more out of these models, so I think we can extrapolate safely. If you're an expert in AI, write back to us if we're wrong, but I think you can extrapolate and say, sure, they could potentially use that model. They are going to get everything that is Duolingo get everything it needs in terms of reasoning and also real time compute to provide you an excellent tutor, probably using that model, I would guess. For all intents and purposes, that's a good example.\n\nTravis Hoium: Lou, when you look at the comeback of Google and Alphabet, is this just where we were headed from the start, and they are just using their power to bludgeon the competition or starve the competition, however you want to look at it, it's gonna be tough. I saw something today they have five of the ten most downloaded apps, free apps in the Apple App store. It just seems like there is so much power coming out of mountain view and OpenAI is going up against that.\nLou Whiteman: We love to talk about this as competitions, Sharks versus jets, whatever. But I think this is just businesses being rational businesses, and I don't think it is like they're going after OpenAI. I think Alphabet is just doing what it should be doing. The fear for a while now is that these models would be commodities. That basically, if all these models can essentially do the same thing, you're not going to pay for seven of them, and price is inevitably what you're going to look at. Alphabet has it, and I don't think this is a loan to Alphabet. I think it's bad news for OpenAI, but I think you're going to see this in a lot of the winners is that they have the ability to price competitively, and they're doing so. It is really lousy for OpenAI because they don't have the existing revenue streams. They don't have the ready access to especially corporate customers. But look, everything we're talking about, this is ASA was talking about efficiency. ASA was talking about energy use. This is everything we want to happen for humanity, for investors, for everything. I think it could be both bad news for OpenAI, but if we are getting to a point where these things are more cost competitive and they can actually be put to use by more companies, this is a good thing, and I don't think it's a surprise that Big Tech, the ones with all of the resources in the existing business, that they're the ones that can capitalize it over a start-up.\n\nTravis Hoium: Lou, I want to ask you quickly about the market. We've been basically flat over the past month or so, but we're having a pretty good year up 16%, I think it is for the S&P 500 . The interesting thing is the Fed started cutting rates, and yet the 10 year is up. How do you think about going into the end of the year at the start of 2026? Is the market starting to run out of gas, or is there something else going on?\nLou Whiteman: Look, we are always just a measure of conventional wisdom. It's always just like how many bulls and how many bears at a given moment. I hate when we try and read into things are going up, so they will continue or things are tough now, so it's a new paradigm or something like that. I think what we've seen that some of the benefit of the doubt, especially among the big AI companies, is fading, that there is just a hint of skepticism. All these things that people have been talking about for a year now, Travis, the buildout crypto all of the expenses, all of these just worrying signs that didn't really resonate in the market now are just inching in. Again, I don't want to predict the sky is falling. I don't want to predict that it goes down from here, just like I don't think six months ago, we should have said, it has to go up from here since it's not bothering. But again, back to what I said before, in every wave we've ever had, there have been winners and losers. I think there's just more of scrutiny and less benefit of doubt being given to everyone, and I think that's what's playing out in the.\n\nTravis Hoium: I agree, Lou. I think the support that AI companies bring to the market means that capital is staying put. It's rotating around, and we're seeing different themes get money and then being sold. But overall, perhaps this keeps the markets at least level next year. I'm terrible at predicting these things, but we'll see 2026 is almost here. We'll be back in a moment.

Today, I want to have Lou and Asit hand out candy or coal for some of the most important executives or people in finance throughout the year. Lou, I want to start with you. Brian Nichol has been one of the most important people in food, retail, now running Starbucks . Does he get candy or coal in his stocking this year?\nLou Whiteman: The key here is this year because Nicholas had a heck of a career, and I'm taking that away from him, but this has not been the year that he is going to want at the top of his Wikipedia page. I don't think he's getting coal from me. I worry about these yesterday's brands becoming growth stocks again in general I struggle with that. But look, the China joint venture, I think there's at least questions there. There's operational issues with what he's trying to do back to Starbucks. There's been employee action and Starbucks is a really tough company to get its Mojo back. The jury's still out. It's early, etc. I'm not going to declare it a failure, but there has been more questions than answers this year, and so I am not praising the Brian Nichol 2025. I'm sorry, I can't.\n\nTravis Hoium: Asit?\nAsit Sharma: I'll give him spot him another year. I think this is a really difficult business to try to turn around.\nTravis Hoium: He did go from the King of the world to massive project moving from Chipotle to Starbucks.\nAsit Sharma: Yes, it's easier to stay King of the world. I'm not sure I agree with all of the capital decisions that Starbucks has made, but I love at least the push to reinvigorate the brand, to bring it back to what it used to be. I'm not sure that's still possible, but I'll spot him a little bit of candy, like one peppermint candy cane. Ask me next year, and we'll see whether that turns a little more Cole or I'll give some more candy.\nTravis Hoium: Lou, do you think that a brand like Starbucks can get back that magic? Can I just think about my I don't go Starbucks, particularly often, but when I do, you walk in there and there's a counter with 50 cups of coffee and people randomly grabbing them. It's just very different from 10, 20 years ago when it was a place that I would go do homework in college and people would just go hang out at Starbucks. That doesn't even seem to be possible in a lot of Starbucks today.\n\nLou Whiteman: This is a theme that I'm thinking a lot about. Maybe it's just old age, but companies that I think will do fine, but the stock, it's separating out the company and the stock. I think there's a place for Starbucks. I think you can get the magic back, and I still don't know if that pays off for investors as a real wow growth investment. I think it's possible, but I'm getting more and more skeptical about what worked before and inherits the Earth up ahead, and I think about that with Starbucks, Nike , so many of the brands that I'm so in love with over the years.\nTravis Hoium: It'll be interesting to see what we look back on those brands being starting at the pandemic. That was a real turning point for a lot of the ways that we live. You can have a lot of opinions about that's Jerome Powell. Is he getting candy or coal in his stocking from you?\n\nAsit Sharma: He's getting candy. Whatever you think of Jerome Powell, he and I both know what it's like to do your job well when your boss is constantly telling you, I just want you the heck out of here. I'll walk that back. I think our managers and leaders at the Motley Fool Love, all three of us. That was a little bit of a joke, but look, tremendous pressure went from a tightening cycle to an easing cycle this year ended the year with one more bit of quantitative easing. I think doing this against the backdrop of the enormous pressure of the interest rate environment we've been in, the inflation environment, also the supply.\nTravis Hoium: Didn't have a lot of data the last couple of months.\nAsit Sharma: Didn't have data to work off of. The supply imbalances in trade due to tariffs. There's a lot going on there, and I wonder if he didn't adopt some of the methods of one of his earlier predecessors, Alan Greenspan, who famously used to lie in the bath tub to relax and read economic figures. I would guess Jerome did a little bit of that this year, but he held his term, I believe, is up in May of next year. I'm going to give him some high marks. The man deserves a little bit of candy in his stocking.\n\nLou Whiteman: I'll give him a lot of candy, because everything was had said more, not just that his boss or the person who would like to be his boss giving him flack, but look, the markets got used to money being free. The markets became convinced that the only way we can benefit is if money was free. He was not only putting up with or trying to navigate pressure from above, but also, I think pressure from retail and pressure from New York and Wall Street. I think I'm showing my bias here, but I think his take on it that, no, we want to preserve our firepower and not run too fast, I agree with him on that. I think it took a ton of courage to not give in and to take all that. Nothing but candy for me and bathtub or wherever, enjoy your retirement room because you've earned it.\n\nTravis Hoium: Let's move back to tech, and the company that's AI adjacent, we've been waiting for them to get into the AI game. Apple's Tim Cook. Seems like he's missed a lot in 2025. The VR headset was not a hit. Their AI strategy. I don't know what's going on. Yet, they're selling a ton of phones, and at the end of the day, that's what drives the business. Lou, where is your head at with Tim Cook, candy or coal?\nLou Whiteman: He's getting candy. Now, he might not get as much candy as Jerome. I might take some of Jerome Powell's candy and give it to Cook. But look, multiple things can be true. I don't buy the idea that Apple didn't fail at AI because Apple always comes in and innovates. Apple spent a lot of money trying to get AI right, and they didn't, it didn't go to script, so I don't think we can give them a pass on that. That said, everything we talked about, commoditized models, the importance of having revenue, of having a customer base. I think Apple ends up a winner in AI, just working with Tim and or working with. It turns out they didn't have to come up with their own model. I think they're fine. The next big thing is still a real question. You're right they haven't solved it. I'm not Tim Cook, but I don't know the answer there so that is lingering over them. But if nothing else, one of the best run companies in the world gets a solid B this year, even if not an A plus, and that's got to be worth some candy.\n\nAsit Sharma: I'll agree with that. For me, Tim Cook gets two really small peppermint candy canes so there's 24 packs that come, let's give him 1/12th of those. Tim Cook did Tim Cook this year.\nTravis Hoium: That's like a night for the kids at my house.\nAsit Sharma: Yeah. But he did what we expected of him he is this operational genius. It doesn't matter what the environment is. I mentioned tariffs just a moment ago. He navigated all of that pretty flawlessly even look at the latest Apple models. They're starting to get traction in China again, which was a market. I thought they were going to have to at some point, just not write off, but.\nTravis Hoium: It wouldn't have the dominant position they had for a long time.\n\nAsit Sharma: Get used to being maybe a number two so they're still competitive there, and people still want their phones. The key question for Apple is who succeeds, Tim? Can we get someone who executes the level he does? Or do we need a visionary? Because the IP at Apple all the billions that have been poured into their IP is sitting there but has not been successfully monetized outside of its phones and its content. They've tried so many things over the years, like the Apple car. They made a stab at AI, but I agree with Lou. Maybe just partnering up is the way for them to go. There's so much that Apple could do as a company beyond their phone near monopoly for high end phones. I think that, look, this is the question, could you get someone who has a little bit of the Steve Jobs visionary capability in him or her with a lot of Tim Cook's operational excellence? It's a really tough question.\n\nTravis Hoium: Have we ever seen a company do that? Go from visionary to operating person back to someone who is visionary, but at this scale that's the other thing is you're talking about one of the biggest companies in the world, somebody young, vibrant coming in and going, Hey, Tim, get out of the way. I'm coming in I got ideas.\nAsit Sharma: With all this AI, you could construct an avatar that blends the two together. I have no idea how they're going to make this work.\nTravis Hoium: It will be very interesting to see what happens with Apple over the next couple of years, especially with that succession planning. That seems like it's going to be a huge topic. Asit, I'm going to start with you with the next one. Sam Altman, candy or coal in his stocking.\n\nAsit Sharma: I've been talking this around the margins, my opinion of Sam Altman this year. It's slightly some coal, a lump of coal. But for a more surprising reason, after everything we've discussed before, I think Sam really whiffed this year with ChatGPT 5.2. He talked that up in a way that we were ready to be blown away as we were in earlier years whenever they released a great new model, and it was really disappointing. In fact, I still go back sometimes to my 4.0 setting because that model of GPT just understands me so well. I love it so much. Are you listening, Sam? Sam, what did you do? Why did you do this? Why did you not understand that talking up a product that was not going to change the world is not a great strategy when you're going out competing in this battlefield, sir? Anyway, so there's a little bit of coal that I have for him and his stock.\n\nTravis Hoium: Lou.\nLou Whiteman: I think I have the answer to that or a potential answer to that and that's because that's what he needs to do.\nTravis Hoium: He's got to raise that next $100 million.\nLou Whiteman: Again he had the most success raising funds when Open AI was magic. He needs Open AI to be magic, whether it is or not. Look, I give him credit for doing what I think he has to do. Now, I don't know if that will end up working out for him, and I don't know. It's a tough thing. At the end of the day, I went to ChatGPT, and I found out that a pound of candy canes is worth 7-15 bucks. A pound of coal is worth about $0.15. Given the way Open AI needs money, I'm going to give him candy canes and not coal just so he can sell the things, need a little less money to raise. How about that?\n\nTravis Hoium: Fair enough. Alright, let's go to someone who was in his final days officially as the CEO. Warren Buffett. Lou, you got to give him candy, right? This has been quite a run.\nLou Whiteman: But are we doing it for this year?\nTravis Hoium: Well, let's do this year.\nLou Whiteman: Brian Nichol has had a great run, Travis. Here's the thing, who am I to question Warren Buffett and that sincerely, and I'm a shareholder. But if you look at this year and you look at the last few years, I do ask myself the question. If it was anyone other than Warren Buffett, what would we be thinking?\nTravis Hoium: Outside of that Apple investment that they made about a decade ago, not a lot of great wins over the past decade.\nLou Whiteman: You can walk and chew gum at the same time. I get saving your investment capital for better markets I get that I agree with Warren. A lot of the markets, to me, have looked overvalued. I've still found ways to place stock. But they have, what, a third of $1 trillion in cash. I feel like you can deploy some of that and still have an ample reserve. I don't think they're going to deploy $350 billion into a Dow turn. I'm going to give him candy it's going to be See's candy, of course, it has to be. But I do think, and we can talk about Greg Abel, too, but I do think that man, the pressure is on because at some point, the benefit of the doubt of Oh, it's just I think if we took the label off this company and looked at their actions over this year and the last few years, I don't think there'd be a lot of people rushing to buy in.\n\nTravis Hoium: Asit.\nAsit Sharma: I'm going with 24 of those small candy canes. I want to give Warren the whole box. I think he deserves it. I think his message implicitly is, Hey, shareholders I gave you about a third of 1 trillion bucks on the balance sheet, cash. I gave you this amazing assemblage of operating companies. I present to you Greg Abel, who I have trained. I have built the culture that we needed. I've done many of these deals on handshakes, and I hope my successors can do the same when they acquire companies. We've been one of the most successful investment vehicles on Earth. I'm going out on top with no regrets. I still have my health. I'm still drinking one can of Coke or more every day. What more do you want? Give me the candy. [OVERLAPPING] I don't know how he has any insides left.\n\nTravis Hoium: Alright. Quickly, Lou. Larry Ellison, candy or coal.\nLou Whiteman: I guess he needs to get candy because every son should have a father so supportive, if nothing else for that.\nTravis Hoium: Hey, dad, I want to take over media.\nLou Whiteman: Larry has always been someone who knows the way the wind is blowing and who can position himself and I don't mean that as a backhanded compliment. It has worked out for him well. I think he has done that well this year. I know there's questions about Blue Owl. I know there's questions about everything right now. I'm not going to bet against Oracle coming out, if nothing worse than fine from this, too, just because Larry knows how to work the room.\nTravis Hoium: Asit, quickly, what do you think about Larry Ellison in 2025?\n\nAsit Sharma: I think Lou did such a great job of hitting his highlights. I want to give him a little bit of coal, an admirer of Larry Ellison, own some Oracle , have recommended it in a service. I just didn't like at the end of the year with all that debt, and I understand the argument that it's staggered out there. That they are just pitching more into a leveraged position and placing such a concentrated bet on their role in AI, which could be a great role their technology is amazing. It colored my view of Larry, but he's a wild guy he's an adventurous guy. We know that. He's always been this way, and so we see it manifest in his business dealings and the risks he takes.\nTravis Hoium: When we come back, we going to get to Stock Center Radar, you're listening to Motley Fool Money.

We like to end the show by asking each channelist for a stock on their radar and get some questions from Dan Boyd behind the glass. Lou, you're up first. What's on your radar this week?\n\nLou Whiteman: Consulting giant Accenture , they released earnings this week. Numbers look pretty good to me. Revenue up 6% year over year, earnings per share up 10%, both top the Wall Street estimates. Look, investors have been down on consultants this year, worried that a tough economy would limit new business. Talk of AI replacing consultants in the future. But Accenture booked $21 billion in new business in the quarter a lot of that AI related, and 33 new clients. There are 33 clients with bookings greater than $100 million. Stock is down 23% for the year, Dan, I think that's a market overreaction. Accenture looks really interesting.\nTravis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about Accenture?\nDan Boyd: Is there anything going for Accenture other than AI right now, Lou?\n\nLou Whiteman: Yeah. Oh, they do a lot of work that isn't AI. It's just AI is all anyone wants to talk about. Look, Dan, at the end of the day, if you're a CEO and you want to do a project, you hire Accenture just so you can blame them if it goes wrong. That's the bull case.\nTravis Hoium: Asit, what's on your radar this week?\nAsit Sharma: I'll make this short and sweet. I'm looking at Embraer . This is the Brazilian jet Maker symbol EMBJ. This is a business I wrote about 13 years ago, and the stock did nothing, but here we are. The aerospace industry has changed. Now the company has a tremendous backlog. It has a number one position in 76 Cedar plane the type of plane that I take when I have to fly from Raleigh to Washington. It also is a leader in the small and midsize business jet category. It's a business that's operating at pretty good margins for an aerospace manufacturer about 9%. Also, Embraer is really great for its maintenance services. It's getting a lot of incremental revenue from maintenance and repair.\n\nTravis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about small jets?\nDan Boyd: I don't know anything about small jets, Travis. I am worried about investing in a small jet company. It seems like I don't need a small jet. I can't afford a small jet. Are people buying small jets?\nAsit Sharma: Well, Dan, the bulk of their business, actually, you probably flown on an Embraer and didn't know it in a small market, but we understand from before the show, you don't fly to small cities you only fly to big cities.\nDan Boyd: No, Asit, I'm big time, Dan Boyd.\nTravis Hoium: Alright, big time Dan Boyd, which stock is going on your watch list?\nDan Boyd: I don't know. Again, I'm getting big time Asit here, and I'm going to go with Accenture so sorry, jets.\n\nTravis Hoium: Or Lou Whiteman, Asit Sharma, Dan Boyd behind the class and the entire Motley Fool team. I'm Travis Hoium. Thanks listening to Motley Fool Money. We'll see you here tomorrow.\nAsit Sharma, CPA has positions in Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, and Oracle.

      "Content": "Alphabet vs. Microsoft: Better AI Stock to Own in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Microsoft's Azure has been the fastest grower of the big three cloud computing companies.\nAlphabet has a cost advantage with its custom AI chips that should become more evident starting next year.\nBoth stocks should perform well in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two of the largest cloud computing companies in the world, and both have been seeing strong growth as a result of artificial intelligence (AI) . However, in 2025, Alphabet's stock clearly shone; it's up around 65% as of this writing, compared to about a 16% gain for Microsoft.\n\nLet's see which stock is best positioned to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Microsoft Microsoft was hitting on all cylinders in 2025, although its stock still slightly trailed the performance of the S&P 500 heading into the final week of trading. Last quarter, the company grew its total revenue by 18% year over year and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 23%, as it saw strength across segments.\n\nThe growth is being led by its cloud computing unit, Azure, which has been the fastest growing of the big three cloud providers. Last quarter, Azure revenue surged 40%, driven by demand for AI services. It was the ninth consecutive quarter of 30% or more growth for Azure. Growth could have been even more robust if Azure were not capacity-constrained, and Microsoft said, given accelerated demand, that its capital expenditures (capex) will now grow at a quicker pace in fiscal 2026 versus last year.\nMicrosoft continues to have strong ties to OpenAI, with whom it owns a 27% stake. It also has exclusive intellectual property rights and privileged application programming interface access to its large language models (LLMs) through 2032. This, combined with OpenAI making an additional $250 billion in computing commitments, should help continue to drive strong growth in the coming years. The company has also struck a deal with Anthropic.\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology throughout its products -- such as its AI assistant copilots -- which is also helping to drive growth. An expected July price hike for Microsoft 365 enterprise users should boost revenue next year.\nThe case for Alphabet Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet's growth is being led by its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud. Last quarter, Google Cloud revenue soared 34%, while its segment operating income surged 84%. Although its revenue growth is a bit slower, the company has some strong advantages that should start to become more pronounced in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIts biggest edge is its custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). While Microsoft has developed its own custom AI chips, they are far behind Alphabet's TPUs, which were created more than a decade ago and have been tightly woven into its system. This gives it a large structural cost advantage over Microsoft, which is still reliant on Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs). Alphabet's TPUs are so good that Anthropic has placed a big order for them to run some of its AI workloads.\n\nAlphabet has also developed Gemini, one of the top LLMs in the world and another long-term advantage over Microsoft, which largely depends on OpenAI. This gives it not only more flexibility as it incorporates Gemini throughout its products but also more revenue streams. Meanwhile, by having both top-tier chips and AI models, Alphabet has created a flywheel effect that Microsoft just does not have.\nThe verdict Alphabet and Microsoft trade at similar valuations. Alphabet trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times 2026 analyst estimates, while Microsoft trades at 30 times fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) estimates and 26 times fiscal 2027 estimates. Given their valuation and growth outlooks, I think both stocks can perform well next year.\n\nHowever, I think that, ultimately, Alphabet's stock will once again outperform. The company has a long-term advantage in having the most complete AI tech stack, and that should become more noticeable next year, especially if it starts renting out its TPUs to more customers. Meanwhile, if Google search revenue continues to accelerate, driven by its AI initiatives, investors will likely start to bid up the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Could This Underrated AI Stock Be the Best Growth Story of 2026 and the Next Decade?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:06 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points The mainstream introduction of AI and increased competition was one of the best things to happen to Alphabet.\nThe company has a big structural cost advantage with its custom AI chips.\nAlphabet has the most complete tech stack of any AI company, setting it up to outperform over the next decade.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWhile Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has been the best performer among the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks this year, it still may be one of the most underrated artificial intelligence (AI) stocks around and has one of the best growth stories both next year and over the long term.\nLet's look at why Alphabet is a stock you'll want to invest in .\nControlling the entire tech stack When OpenAI introduced AI chatbots to the masses, Alphabet's Google search engine faced its first real competition in decades. However, it likely is one of the best things that could have happened to the company. First, the competition from AI was one of the biggest reasons the company was allowed to keep its Chrome browser and Android smartphone operating system, each of which holds an over-70% market share, despite losing a government antitrust case.\n\nNot only that, but the judge also let it keep its exclusive search revenue-sharing deal with Apple . If not for the looming threat of AI, this may not have played out this way.\nHowever, the ruling ultimately kept intact Alphabet's huge distribution advantage. Through Chrome, Android, and its revenue-sharing deal with Apple, Google Search is the default gateway to the internet for people around the world. It also gives the company multiple surfaces to incorporate its own Gemini AI model into. This is a big edge over chatbot apps, as it's meeting people where they already are and is creating a frictionless AI experience. That's easier than having people download and use a stand-alone app.\nAt the same time, competition from OpenAI and others also brought the best out of the company and shone a light on some of its behind-the-scenes innovations. Alphabet has long been working on AI, but there was no real need to push it forward given its dominant search position. However, the introduction of ChatGPT helped supercharge its efforts and led it to create one of the best large language models (LLMs) available: Gemini. As it incorporates Gemini throughout its products, this is now helping drive query and revenue growth.\n\nThe emergence of AI also threw a spotlight on Alphabet's decades-long development of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Alphabet has long been using these custom chips to run its internal workloads, but as the need for computing power exploded to run AI workloads, Alphabet suddenly found itself in an enviable position.\n\nStory Continues\nIts chips could train LLMs and run AI inference at a much cheaper cost than Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs), giving it a big structural cost advantage. This has created a huge flywheel for the company, where it can more cheaply train its model, giving it the resources to make both Gemini and its chips better, leading to more success and the cash to put back into its LLM and chip efforts.\n\nAlphabet's TPUs have become so good that they are now a competitive alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. For example, Anthropic has placed orders to use TPUs to begin to power some of its AI workloads. Morgan Stanley projects that Alphabet will get roughly $13 billion in annual revenue for every 500,000 TPUs that customers deploy. Its analysts estimate that Alphabet will rent out 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028.\nBeyond TPUs and Gemini Alphabet's chip advantage isn't just in hardware. The TPUs are specifically designed to handle tasks optimized for its TensorFlow framework and, more recently, other frameworks, such as JAX and PyTorch, used to train neural networks. It's also integrated with Alphabet's software, such as its XLA compilers, which fuse multiple small tasks into a single optimized operation. This allows AI workloads to run more quickly while using significantly less power and memory. Meanwhile, its Vertex AI platform allows customers to easily use its TPUs and XLA compilers.\n\nThe company is also looking to extend its vertical integration advantage. It is set to acquire cloud computing cybersecurity company Wiz to add another level to its tech stack. It also just announced that it is purchasing energy infrastructure company Intersect to help it secure access to necessary power for its data center buildout.\nAlphabet is the most complete end-to-end AI company on the planet, and the advantages of its vertical integration and its controlling the complete tech stack should just grow over time. That's what makes it the best growth story in AI both for 2026 and over the next decade.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

Alphabet shares have outperformed the industry in a year. GOOGL is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, Google Cloud, and Search. Google Cloud ended the third quarter of 2025 with $155 billion in backlog, up 46% sequentially. The number of new Google Cloud Platform customers increased by roughly 34% year over year, and 70% of Google Cloud customers now use Alphabet’s AI products. In third-quarter 2025, revenues from products built on Alphabet’s generative AI models (Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria) grew more than 200% year-over-year, reflecting accelerating adoption. Search is benefiting from AI Overviews and AI Mode that has driven growth in overall queries. YouTube is benefiting from the growing demand for shorts. Management execution has been good in recent times, which has helped Alphabet to build solid cash and short-term investment balance.\n\nCiena Corporation ( CIEN ) is a leading provider of optical networking equipment, software and services.Ciena’s fiscal fourth-quarter reflected year-over-year 20% top-line gains, 69.5% EPS growth and a record $5 million order backlog, driven by accelerating AI-led demand from cloud and service provider customers. Driven by strong cloud and service provider momentum, Ciena gained 2 points of optical market share year to date and expects further gains in 2026. Networking Platforms revenue rose 22% to $1.05 billion, driven by 19% Optical growth on a 72% RLS surge and 49% growth in Routing and Switching from DCOM demand. Ciena lifted its fiscal 2026 revenue outlook to $5.7-$6.1 billion, nearly 24% growth at the midpoint, up from the prior 17%, on strong demand from cloud, DCI, and AI infrastructure.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Buy Stock in the Mag 7 Hyperscalers or Are They Spending Too Much?\n\nShaun Pruitt\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAlthough they are among the world’s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\nThis includes Amazon AMZN , Alphabet GOOGL , Meta Platforms META , and Microsoft MSFT , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\n\nThere is no doubt that “hyperscaling” is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns Notably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billion.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nROIC Comparison With Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market’s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\nAmazon’s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance Magnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon’s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon’s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\n\nStory Continues\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts Amazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500’s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Title": "Why 2026 could be Waymo's year",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-2026-could-be-waymos-year-195850263.html",
      "Content": "Why 2026 could be Waymo's year\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:58 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nUBER\n\nZK\n\nFrom Los Angeles to Austin to Atlanta, Waymo robotaxis are everywhere. And 2026 could be the year Waymo expands its lead in the space.\nWaymo, part of Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), began in 2009 as an in-house startup within Google's X initiative and officially became Waymo in 2016. In 2018, Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker's I-Pace EV for its testing. This is the vehicle most users are accustomed to seeing.\n\nSince 2020, anyone in its service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that it performs around 250,000 trips a week and has performed 20 million trips since the service began.\nBut those numbers are likely to jump, perhaps big-time. The company is targeting around 1 million rides a week by the end of 2026 — four times its current volume.\nWhy 2026 could be a big year for Waymo In 2026, Waymo will enter its most aggressive expansion phase yet, moving beyond its current territories to tackle more US cities and international markets.\nCurrently, Waymo has robotaxi fleets in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta, where users can summon vehicles using Waymo's app or from partners like Uber ( UBER ) in Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe plan for 2026 moves beyond those areas, eventually adding 20 new markets. Waymo says it is progressing in test areas in the South, including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, with full service expected to begin in early 2026.\nIn the West, the company plans to add Las Vegas and San Diego, with targeted service start dates in 2026.\nIn the Northeast, Waymo is testing in Detroit and Washington, D.C., also for 2026 launches, and added Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis to the list earlier this month. The difficulties with northern cities, which are prone to inclement weather and conditions like snow that could block the cars' sensors, is of particular importance. Each of these cities will begin Waymo service with human operators before scaling up to driverless. The human operator sits the driver's seat and takes over if needed.\n\nThe company is also testing in highly populous areas like New York City , which requires special permitting and will likely take a much longer time to ramp up to official service. The company did not give a targeted start date for New York City service. Waymo is also scheduled to add service in London, its first international market, starting sometime in 2026, and has been testing in Tokyo since April.\nFor its part, Tesla ( TSLA ), which operates a ride-hailing service service with safety occupants, has only been in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area since mid-2025 but will supposedly expand in Nevada and Phoenix next year.\n\nStory Continues\nTo meet these goals, the company is expanding its manufacturing facilities. Waymo, along with its manufacturing parter Magna, will expand its new plant in Arizona to double production and build more than 2,000 vehicles at the facility by the end of 2026.\nThe company will begin to assemble its next-generation robotaxi on Zeekr's RT platform, with the stated goal of building \"tens of thousands\" of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year.\n\nWall Street is mostly in favor.\n\"Waymo is furthest along in true driverless deployment: it is already operating fully autonomous ride-hail services in parts of Phoenix, San Francisco (Bay Area), Los Angeles, and testing in additional US cities, with no safety driver in the vehicle for many rides,\" Deutsche Bank's Edison Yu wrote in early December. \"These are limited geofence, high CAPEX operations, but they prove the technical feasibility of Level 4 autonomy in constrained urban zones.\"\nBut Yu added that Waymo's tech \"stack\" is heavily dependent on costly equipment like lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors, radar, and cameras, and is map-dependent, which slows scaling speed and pushes up the per-vehicle cost.\nMorgan Stanley's robotics research team, now led by longtime analyst Adam Jonas, agrees that Waymo's tech, though impressive, will be held back by higher costs compared to Tesla, which uses a vision-only system powered by a neural network, essentially acting like a robotic driver.\nIn Waymo's defense, the company and analysts like Deutsche Bank's Yu argue that the complement of sensors and cameras helps with reliability and safety.\nWaymo's data shows its robotaxis are involved in fewer accidents involving serious injury, airbag deployment, or any injury, for that matter, compared to human drivers. In fact, a human driver is five times more likely to be involved in an accident resulting in an injury compared to a Waymo robotaxi (0.8 crashes per 1 million miles in Waymo vs 3.96 crashes per 1 million miles with a human driver).\n\nThough details are still scarce, Tesla data via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shows Tesla robotaxis had seven crashes in 250,000 miles, implying a crash rate of around 28 crashes per 1 million miles.\nPublic safety is also a key regulatory challenge facing both Waymo and Tesla, with permitting across various municipalities complicated to navigate and possible overarching federal guidelines that the NHTSA hinted may be coming.\n\nAnd though not a passenger safety concern, the electrical blackout on Dec. 20 in San Francisco led to embarrassing \"bricking\" of Waymo robotaxis , leaving them stuck in the middle of streets, unable to move due to traffic signals being inoperative. Incidents like these are headaches for municipalities, though Waymo promises a software update will alleviate these incidents.\n\nNevertheless, passenger safety is most important, and Waymo's data reporting showing its strong safety record will help cities looking to test robotaxis in their jurisdictions, as well as win over the public, which may be open to but skeptical about riding in driverless cars.\nWaymo's own ubiquitousness may also help in its rollout. While a survey performed by the Verge in April 2024 found that, overall, 45% of respondents believed robotaxi services were safe (compared to 37% against), the percentages were actually higher in cities where Waymo was already operating (54% for and 32% against).\nA recent survey conducted in San Francisco this past July found that ​​67% of San Francisco residents now support the operation of driverless robotaxis, up from 44% in 2023, with \"net favorability\" of robotaxis swinging from -7% in late 2023 to +38% in mid-2025.\nPras Subramanian is Lead Auto Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Why anchoring 2026 portfolios in Big Tech and cybersecurity is the way to go\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWD\n\nGOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nANET\n\nThe next phase of the AI trade is more about growth and survival than simply chasing the most coveted names.\n\"I definitely wouldn't just bet on Nvidia,\" Adam Coons, chief investment officer at Winthrop Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. \"We kind of like to barbell this with something like the big hyperscaler, like an Alphabet Google, because that's really the type of name that you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because the AI story is just benefitting an already existing business model that was doing well.\"\nThe \"barbell\" strategy is born out of a growing skepticism toward \"one-trick ponies.\" In this case, Coons says it applies to companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), and Palantir ( PLTR ), which rely almost exclusively on the current AI hardware rush.\n\nWhile these names have led the market higher, their valuations have reached a point where \"margin of safety\" is effectively zero. In Coons's view, when a stock is priced to perfection, even a minor earnings miss can trigger a catastrophe.\n\"You need to position size,\" he said.\nBy anchoring a portfolio in \"behemoth hyperscalers\" like Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ), investors get exposure to AI through companies with diversified cash flows. Such companies aren't just AI plays, but are advertising and software giants that use AI to optimize businesses that were already succeeding.\n\nIf the \"safe\" end of the barbell is Big Tech, the other side is \"growth,\" and it can be found in the infrastructure required to keep those systems running and secure.\n\"Down the chain, we like the things that overall the AI story will help prop up,\" Coons said. \"For us, it's cybersecurity [as it] becomes more and more important.\"\nHe added that Fortinet ( FTNT ) and CrowdStrike ( CRWD ) are among \"two of our top picks on the security side.\"\nAs AI advances, so does the risk for hacking, Coons noted. Cybersecurity isn't a discretionary expense, but a tax on the digital age that must be paid. Unlike the volatile demand for graphics processing units, the need for protection is more predictable.\nThe sector isn't without its risks, however. CrowdStrike faced a global IT outage in July 2024, caused by a faulty software update. It prompted the \"blue screens of death\" across 8.5 million machines, including airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nCoons says the final piece of the 2026 investor blueprint is disciplined position sizing. He suggests building a \"basket\" of smaller, high-conviction names — like Reddit ( RDDT ), which he views as a unique data play for AI training — but with the caveat of keeping those positions small.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to Coons, the average investor should steer clear of trying to find the next Nvidia. The low-hanging fruit has been picked, and winning 2026 is more about leaning into the giants that own the platforms and the specialists who protect the data.\nAdditionally, Chris Versace, chief investment officer at Tematica Research, sees Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) and Arista Networks ( ANET ) as the next logical steps in the AI revolution.\n\nVersace argues that the massive spending on data centers is creating a \"network congestion\" problem. As AI usage explodes, the connection between chips becomes the new bottleneck.\n\"It's the network connection that will be the big bottleneck that I think folks are missing,\" Versace notes, pointing to Marvel because of its dominance in optical and networking hardware.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Although nine publicly traded American companies have achieved a valuation of $1 trillion or more, only four have graduated into the $3 trillion club.\nAmazon is an incredibly diverse technology company, with a dominant market position in industries like e-commerce, cloud computing, and more.\nThe tech titan could join the $3 trillion club in 2026 thanks to a combination of its attractive valuation and its strong earnings growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nNine publicly traded American companies are worth $1 trillion or more, but only four have graduated into the exclusive $3 trillion club so far: Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , and Microsoft .\nI think Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could join them by the end of 2026 thanks to the accelerating revenue growth in its cloud computing division, and the surging profits in its legacy e-commerce business. The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Forget High‑Risk AI Penny Stocks: This Established AI Leader Is a Safer Long‑Term Bet\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Many new AI companies are making big promises without much progress to show for it.\nAlphabet's massive quantity of data from its businesses gives it an advantage in training AI.\nIt also has nearly $99 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at its disposal.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been around for a while, but it has undoubtedly leaped into the mainstream with the popularity of generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT. With this new surge of excitement and interest, we've seen legacy companies pivot to making AI a focal part of their business, and plenty of newer AI companies hit the scene with big promises.\nThe issue is that the AI boom has ushered in a lot of AI stocks that are headed nowhere fast. And unfortunately, they're taking investors along for the ride as people search for the \"next big thing\" in the bargain bin via penny stocks. There's seemingly no shortage of AI penny stocks in the market right now.\nYet, these stocks often come with more risk than is needed for someone looking to invest in AI and take advantage of the emerging technology. Instead, it's wise to go with an established AI leader that has stood the test of time and continues to be at the forefront of innovation.\nA full-stack AI company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) might be best known for Google and YouTube, but it has plenty of other businesses and ventures under its umbrella that operate in virtually all phases of the AI pipeline outside of manufacturing AI chips.\nTo begin, DeepMind is an AI research lab that has made breakthroughs that modern AI relies on. This gives Alphabet in-house access to some of the smartest people in the field. It also owns dozens of data centers (and plans to build plenty more), allowing it to process the massive amounts of data its AI needs.\n\nAlphabet designs its own advanced AI chips, reducing its reliance on companies like Nvidia , which charges premiums and could have issues meeting demand in the near future. It has its own cloud platform, Google Cloud, which is currently the third largest in the world by market share.\nThen there's Alphabet's consumer-facing applications, like Gemini, and its ecosystem of software products that allow it to integrate its AI models into tools people already use daily.\nAlphabet has a key advantage not easily replicated One thing working in Alphabet's favor when it comes to its AI tools is the amount of data it has.\nGoogle Search is essentially the gateway to the internet, collecting billions of questions and getting an inside look into what people are interested in; YouTube has billions of hours of data that give insight into what people enjoy watching and what topics are trending; and Maps has tons of data on how the world moves and the places people are interested in.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's only a few sources, too. There's also the Android operating system that is on billions of phones, and Gmail, which millions of people use. AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and Alphabet has more data than virtually any other company in the world.\nWith its data advantage, Alphabet has a chance to make its AI models the most accurate and nuanced of all.\n\nNo penny stock can compete with Alphabet's finances One thing you'll never have to second-guess with Alphabet is its ability to make money. In the third quarter, it generated $102.3 billion in revenue (up 16% year over year and its first-ever $100 billion quarter), and its net income totaled nearly $35 billion (up 33% year over year). Both of those have grown impressively over the past five years.\nAlphabet is a certified cash cow, with nearly $99 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, giving it the capital to continue investing in its AI infrastructure and capabilities. That's what I'd look for in an AI stock instead of essentially gambling on penny stocks, hoping that it works out.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Why the electrical grid needs more software\n\nTim De Chant\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nOne of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was … nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background.\nThat low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch.\n\nElectricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including repurposing supersonic jet engines for data center duty and working on beaming solar power down from space .\nAnd that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is projected to nearly triple in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled consumer frustration around pricing and drawn the ire of environmental groups that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.\n\nThis confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.\nFor example, startups like Gridcare and Yottar argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.\nGridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amidst the data center boom.\nSeveral other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.\n\nBase Power, for example, is building one in Texas by leasing batteries to homeowners at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.\n\nStory Continues\nOther startups including Texture, Uplight, and Camus are developing software layers to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.\nThere’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid.\n\nNvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to develop industry-specific models in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is working with the grid operator PJM to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.\nThese changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold.\nUtilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability.\nSoftware, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction.\nAnd that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It’s cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Renner\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:33 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGM\n\nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin said stepping away from day-to-day work no longer made sense as artificial intelligence accelerated, prompting him to return to active development.\nHe recently told Stanford School of Engineering Dean Jennifer Widom that he felt himself \"spiraling\" and \"not being sharp,\" a realization that led him back into active AI development at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL)).\n\nDon't Miss:\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nWhen Time Away Lost Its Appeal Brin said he retired about a month before COVID hit, with plans to sit in cafés and study physics. When routines disappeared, he said he was \"kind of stewing\" without a technical outlet and felt mentally disengaged.\nAs Alphabet gradually allowed a limited number of employees back into offices, he began returning more often. That return led to deeper involvement in internal AI work, including Google's Gemini AI models, which he said was \"very rewarding.\" Brin said staying retired \"would've been a big mistake.\"\n\nHow Google Reached Its AI Crossroads Brin also offered a direct assessment of Google's AI trajectory. He said the company underinvested after publishing the 2017 Transformer research paper, which later became foundational for many large language models.\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\n\nHe told Widom that internal caution slowed broader releases because of concerns that chatbots could \"say dumb things.\" While Google held back, competitors moved faster. Brin said OpenAI \"ran with it,\" a move that accelerated public adoption of generative AI tools.\nEven so, he said Google benefited from long-term investment in neural-network research, custom-built chips, and large-scale data centers . Brin said very few companies operate across the full AI stack at that scale, including in-house research, proprietary semiconductors, and global computing infrastructure.\nWhy He Urges Students To Stay Technical Asked how students should prepare for careers shaped by AI, Brin cautioned against abandoning technical fields. He said choosing a different discipline simply because AI can write code misses how broadly those systems already operate.\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\n\"I wouldn't go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,\" he said. Brin said AI already performs well across many nontechnical tasks and that coding remains valuable and widely used inside AI development.\n\nStory Continues\nBrin also reflected on earlier missteps, including Google Glass. \"Everybody thinks they're the next Steve Jobs,\" he said. \"I've definitely made that mistake.\"\nNow closely involved with the models, Brin said the pace of progress keeps him engaged. He said, \"If you skip the news in AI for a month, you're way behind.\"\n\nRead Next: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "Why Alphabet Just Paid $4.75 Billion for Intersect -- and What It Means for the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Intersect specializes in energy management solutions for data centers.\nBuilding an AI data center requires more than just chips and servers -- efficient energy solutions are also needed.\nAs the AI infrastructure era kicks off, investors should expect to see more capital flow toward the energy space.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nIt's been a busy period for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . In mid-November, investors learned that Warren Buffett's investment conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway , took a $4 billion stake in the internet giant during the third quarter. Subsequently, shares soared to new all-time highs.\nThen on Dec. 22, Alphabet announced a definitive agreement to acquire Intersect, a provider of data center and energy infrastructure solutions, for $4.75 billion. As Alphabet continues to push the frontiers of all things artificial intelligence (AI), investors may be wondering how the Intersect deal fits into the company's long-term roadmap.\nLet's dig into why this deal represents a savvy move by Alphabet, and unpack what it could mean for the broader AI infrastructure movement.\nWhat does Intersect do, and why is it important? When it comes to AI-related capital expenditures (capex), most investors immediately think of graphics processing units (GPUs), server architecture, and other networking gear hosted inside data centers. While these costs are indeed important, the rising expenses of procuring chips are only part of the equation.\n\nIntersect develops utility-scale renewable energy solutions for data centers. The company places various sources of power generation, such as wind, solar, and battery, alongside data centers. This co-location strategy allows Intersect to power its infrastructure efficiently, bypassing long wait times associated with new facilities accessing the U.S. electrical grid.\nWhy did Alphabet acquire Intersect? One of the biggest drains on gross margins for AI developers is the rising cost of energy. As AI workloads continue to grow, investors can expect training and inference costs to multiply exponentially from their current levels .\nAlphabet is trying to hedge against these headwinds by gaining control over its future energy costs. Tucking Intersect into its ecosystem allows Alphabet to access data center capacity more efficiently than relying on external utility providers. This will become increasingly important as the company brings new products and services online to its Gemini model and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\nInvestors should not be surprised by Alphabet's decision to acquire Intersect. The company already employs a vertically integrated business model across its search, cloud, advertising, and consumer electronics businesses.\n\nStory Continues\nWhether it's furthering research in quantum computing through DeepMind, accelerating the production of its custom Tensor Processing Unit chips, or refining the algorithms powering search across Google and YouTube, Alphabet's core assets are stitched together by the same thread: artificial intelligence.\n\nIntersect represents another layer of Alphabet's vertically integrated model, providing the company with greater cost visibility as well as critical flexibility around the future of its infrastructure buildouts.\nWhat does the Intersect deal signal about AI infrastructure? For the last three years, chip companies such as Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , and Broadcom have raced to design cutting-edge hardware to serve as the backbone of generative AI development. While demand for next-generation chips isn't waning by any stretch of the imagination, most hyperscalers realize that AI accelerators will eventually become commoditized.\n\nIn my eyes, Alphabet's acquisition of Intersect already signals that these dynamics are in motion. Although chip procurement remains a priority, Alphabet is getting a head start in laying the groundwork to lower the overall cost of compute and improve the flow of data within GPU clusters by acquiring Intersect.\nThis deal suggests that hyperscalers will not be able to afford to rely on incremental improvements from GPU developers and external power providers in the long run. In a broader sense, this move by Alphabet signals that the AI infrastructure era will feature much more than new chips.\nOver the next several years, I suspect more players in big tech will follow a similar playbook to that of Alphabet and begin accelerating investment in the energy infrastructure space -- diversifying their AI budgets beyond new chips and interconnect gear.\n\nUltimately, I believe the biggest winners of the AI revolution will be those who control all aspects of the value chain, from hardware and software design to the costs associated with energy management and infrastructure development.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

Can she claim Social Security at 62 and later switch to spousal benefits?\n‘Is it a case of them or us?’ We’re in our 40s. Do we retire early in our 50s — or save for our kids’ education?\nLogan Paul’s $5.3 million Pokémon bet raises a bigger question: Do collectibles belong in your portfolio?\nThe hot AI trade faces a 1980s style trap and these risks, says this market bull\n\nWhich lane has the best risk-reward?\nMason\nDear Mason, All three lanes lead somewhere. The question is which one fits your risk tolerance.\nPure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum QBTS are lottery tickets with better odds. They’re not competing with the Magnificent Seven; they’re auditioning to be acquired by them. If one of these companies cracks a genuine commercial advantage, it becomes a buyout target overnight. High risk; asymmetric upside.\n\nThe Mag Seven are already in: Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN have billion-dollar quantum programs. So does IBM IBM. You’re not betting on whether they’ll participate. You’re betting on whether quantum becomes material to their earnings this decade. Safer, but the quantum upside is diluted by everything else in the stock.\nInfrastructure is where the near-term money lives. Post-quantum cryptography is already a compliance issue. NIST standardized new algorithms in 2024, and every government contractor, bank and defense company needs to upgrade. That’s not speculative. That’s a budget line-item.\nThe picks-and-shovels play isn’t qubits. It’s the classical-quantum interface: cryogenic systems, control electronics, error-correction software. Less sexy than “we built a quantum computer” — and more likely to generate revenue this decade.\n\nMy bias? I own positions across all three lanes, but I’m most interested in security infrastructure. That’s the toll road everyone has to drive on.\nDiversified but opinionated,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best investors in the mobile revolution didn’t bet on which phone would win. They bet on Qualcomm’s QCOM chips inside all of them.\nDear Charlie, Quantum computing is just another fantasy — like AI was for decades. Error correction is still unsolved.\nThis is vaporware.\nNancy\nDear Nancy, Error correction was unsolved. Past tense.\n\nStory Continues\nIn December 2024, Google’s Willow chip became the first quantum processor to demonstrate “below threshold” error correction. That’s the holy grail physicists have chased for 30 years. The chip showed that scaling up qubit arrays, from 3×3 to 5×5 to 7×7, reduced error rates instead of compounding them. That’s never happened before.\n\nThree weeks later, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in topological qubits. Amazon’s Ocelot chip cut error-correction costs by 90%. IBM confirmed it’s on track for a 100,000-qubit system by 2029. A University of Chicago professor called it “escape velocity.”\nYou’re right that quantum computing was vaporware for decades. So was AI. In 2020, experts said artificial general intelligence was 50 years away. In 2024, AI writes code, passes the bar exam and diagnoses cancer better than radiologists.\nThe difference between “decades away” and “here” is usually about 18 months of denial.\nStill skeptical after all these years,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best time to invest in a technology is when smart people still think it’s a fantasy.\nDear Charlie, North Korea stole $2 billion in crypto in 2024. When quantum computing matures, all encryption is at risk. What makes you think bitcoin BTCUSD survives?\nAlex\nDear Alex, You’re conflating two different problems: hackers and hardware.\nNorth Korea didn’t crack bitcoin’s cryptography. It compromised employees. The Bybit heist, around $1.5 billion, came from social engineering and insider access, not supercomputers. That’s not a quantum threat. That’s a human one.\nNow, the real question: What happens when quantum computers can break elliptic curve cryptography?\n\nAnswer: Everything breaks. Not just bitcoin. Google, Microsoft, the U.S. Federal Reserve, every bank, every military system, every government database on earth. If quantum computing cracks bitcoin, it’s already cracked the entire digital infrastructure of modern civilization. Bitcoin isn’t the first domino. It’s somewhere around the 40th.\nBut here’s what the doomsayers miss: bitcoin upgrades. The U.S. government’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) — the same agency that sets the standards for everything from weights and measures to cybersecurity — standardized quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms in 2024.\nThe bitcoin network can migrate to post-quantum signatures. Active coins move to new addresses with new encryption.\n\nLost bitcoins, including founder Satoshi’s, stay frozen in old addresses. That’s roughly 4 million coins in vulnerable P2PK addresses that become unspendable. Security goes up. Circulating supply goes down. That’s not a death sentence for bitcoin. That’s a supply shock.\nTimeline? Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang says 15 to 30 years before quantum computers can break current encryption. Bitcoin security expert Jameson Lopp estimates bitcoin needs five to 10 years to complete a migration. The math works.\nQuantum computing is a threat to everything. That’s exactly why it isn’t a special threat to bitcoin.\nWatching the sausage get made,\nCharlie\nP.S. North Korea’s hackers don’t need quantum physics. They just need your password.\nDear Charlie, Horizon scanning is no longer optional. First movers will be those who translate technical complexity into business strategy.\nDon’t you agree?\nSarah\nDear Sarah, Exactly right. The companies that win won’t be the ones with the most qubits. They’ll be the ones who figure out what to do with them first.\nQubits are a vanity metric. Error-corrected, commercially viable quantum systems are the real race. The winners will be the ones that turn physics experiments into recurring revenue.\n\nYou’re right that horizon scanning is no longer optional. The companies that spot quantum’s commercial applications first will own the decade. The ones still waiting for proof of concept will be writing case studies about what they missed.\nEyes on the horizon,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best business strategies are written by people who understand what the technology can’t do yet.\nDear Charlie, You’re right that “wafer-scale cryogenic integration” makes investment decisions difficult.

They’re the ones who understand the implications.\n\nYou’re buying the complexity. I’m right there with you.\nFellow traveler,\nCharlie\nP.S.

Those systems could eventually break many forms of current encryption, raising concerns that data stolen today could be decoded later, a practice often described as harvest now, decrypt later.\nBy adopting new security tools ahead of formal global standards, Bahrain is aiming to reduce exposure before those risks become more immediate. The platform is intended to help agencies spot vulnerabilities and adjust protections over time as threats evolve.\nThe agreement also highlights growing government interest in AI-driven cybersecurity, as public institutions look to move from reactive responses toward earlier prevention.\nSandboxAQ emerged from Alphabet's internal research efforts and now operates as an independent company focused on enterprise and government security applications.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Amazon stock could have nearly 50% upside in 2026\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nAmazon's ( AMZN ) stock has hardly had a prime performance in 2025.\nShares of the e-commerce and cloud giant are only up 6% year to date, badly lagging the 18% advance for the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ). Experts cite slowing sales growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) business and mixed sentiment on the company's ability to monetize artificial intelligence as the drivers of the \"mixed\" sentiment.\nAmazon didn't do much to bolster sentiment in October when it announced its largest-ever round of layoffs in its history, eliminating 14,000 corporate roles.\nThe stock is likely to close out the year with the unenviable award for worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" member.\n\nFor perspective, the top performer of the Magnificent Seven, Alphabet ( GOOG ), has surged 66% this year on the back of optimism for its new Gemini 3 model .\nBut Wall Street has stuck with Amazon, with some even putting it on their \"top picks\" lists for 2026.\nEvercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney wrote that he thinks Amazon has about 50% upside potential. He was one of the Street analysts slapping a top pick stamp on the stock.\n\nMahaney cited several catalysts coming into focus soon, including reaccelerating growth at AWS, demand for new Trainium AI chips, further strong growth in advertising revenue, and a ramp in the new Alexa+.\n\"At the end of the day, Amazon remains a high quality compounder (25% EPS compound annual growth rate), with solid double-digit revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and free cash flow likely to inflect up materially in a 24-month timeframe,\" Mahaney said.\nYahoo Finance data shows of the 67 sell-side analysts that cover Amazon, 96% rate the stock a Strong Buy or Buy. The average $295 price target for the Street assumes 27% upside from current levels.\nInput from Polymarket, a Yahoo Finance partner for prediction market data, reveals Main Street has a more skeptical take on the stock, however. About 96% of users think the stock will be little changed by the end of January 2026 compared to today.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth is in Mahaney's bull camp on Amazon, with a more subdued projection on the stock that estimates 30% upside potential.\nAnmuth's thesis on Amazon is similar to Mahaney's, though he noted that Amazon's new $38 billion, seven-year cloud services deal with OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) could \"add upside\" to the company's top line.\n\"Amazon is the most diversified mega-cap across revenues and profit and has various large growth opportunities — mixed sentiment and attractive valuation,\" Anmuth added.\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nTraini Raises $7.5 Million to Build Pet Emotional Intelligence\n\nBusiness Wire\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nXIACF\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif., December 29, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Palo Alto–based pet emotional intelligence startup Traini has announced the completion of a $7.5 million funding round , aiming to bridge the communication gap between humans and pets by developing intelligent systems capable of understanding pet emotions and intentions. The round was led by Banyan Tree , Silver Capital , ZhaoTai Group , and NYX Ventures , with participation from Starting Gate Fund , Jade Capital , and renowned tech investors including VPs from NVIDIA , Julian Qian (Member of technical staff at Anthropic) , Weihe Zheng (Founding Partner, Cowin Capital) , Jia He (Founding Partner, Nanshan Capital) , Peter Xu (CEO, Plug and Play China) , and Zach Zhang (Founding Partner, Edgewater Investments) . Existing investors Tao Foundation and Xiaomi Co-founder Feng Hong also participated. The proceeds will be used primarily for technology R&D, product iteration, and market expansion.\n\nPrior to this, Traini also received investments from senior management at Google, Meta, and Palo Alto Networks and institutional investment from FutureX Capital , BlueSea Partners , Tao Foundation , Mint Capital , and Valkyrie Fund .\nFollowing this round of financing, Traini will launch its first smart hardware product—the world’s first cognitive pet wearable , the Cognitive Smart Collar . This device is also the world’s first human–dog \"language\" translation device built on generative AI. It is now available for pre-order through the Traini App and the website, traini.app .\nTraini founder Arvin Sun stated, \"Our mission is to develop an intelligence that reignites the natural instincts of our furry companions and builds a true spiritual bond between pets and their humans.\" Traini’s founding team brings extensive experience from companies like OpenAI , Chewy , and ByteDance .\n\nTraini is the world’s first—and so far the only—technology company to translate pet behavior using multimodal generative AI. Its breakthrough technology has pioneered a new way for humans to communicate with their pets.\nThe defining feature of Traini’s product lies in its ability to enable real-time voice conversations through its proprietary multimodal models. Traini’s core product, PEBI (Pet Empathic Behavior Interface) , supports multimodal interaction across text, images, video, and audio. By analyzing pets’ vocalizations, facial expressions, and behaviors, PEBI delivers a precise understanding of pets’ psychological and emotional states and expresses them in a human-like conversational form—achieving true, two-way communication between humans and pets.\n\nStory Continues\nTraini’s models cover nearly 120 dog breeds, with emotion translation accuracy reaching up to 94% . PEBI can be applied to behavior translation, emotion recognition, personalized service matching, and pet-assisted healthcare diagnostics. In addition, Traini provides APIs to veterinary clinics and hardware companies, empowering medical services and intelligent device interactions. Traini has established deep partnerships with leading smartphone and electric vehicle brands, and soon users will be able to communicate with their pets in real time directly through mobile operating systems and in-car infotainment systems.\n\nIn product quality validation, beyond collaborating with pet behavior experts for extensive data annotation, Traini has innovatively adopted a \"human–pet vocal spectrogram comparison\" methodology. By using the spectrogram of human speech—captured when expressing corresponding emotions and intentions—as a baseline, Traini compares it against pet vocal patterns to enhance emotional mapping accuracy.\nTraini‘s smart dog collar integrates advanced AI with real-time emotion tracking. It is powered by Traini’s proprietary Valence–Arousal model, 3D Pet Emotion Model and Instant Emotion Vector . Developed in close collaboration with pet behaviorists, the model is built upon insights from more than 900 peer-reviewed studies in animal behavior and trained on behavioral data from over 2 million dogs . Designed to deepen emotional bonds between pets and their owners, the Cognitive Smart Collar helps pet parents gain a richer understanding of their dogs’ emotional well-being and overall mental health.\n\nThe collar's most remarkable feature lies in its ability to autonomously identify and track kinds of emotional states in dogs, including joy, anxiety, excitement, and distress. Translating them into human-understandable language enables real-time, meaningful two-way communication — including vocalizations, emotions, behaviors, and even what the dog \"wants to say.\" Using a combination of sound analysis from the dog’s barks and vital signals like heart rate, temperature, and body movement, Traini’s AI-powered collar interprets these data points to provide a comprehensive emotional profile of the pet. Traini's collar offers actionable feedback that can enhance the bond between owner and pet.\nBeyond everyday care, the collar also has significant potential in the realm of pet healthcare. By continuously monitoring a dog’s emotional and physiological signals, it can help detect early signs of health issues.\n\nOn the user side, Traini has already served over 2 million dogs and received widespread coverage from major media and influencers. Its videos on YouTube have surpassed 70 million views . In 2023, Traini launched PetGPT , a natural-language and behavior-analysis model with 99% coverage across users, improving service engagement by 70% . Earlier this year, it unveiled T-Agent , an AI-powered product recommendation and purchasing system that autonomously identifies dogs’ real needs—allowing pets to make decisions, with their owners acting as co-pilots . Traini now collaborates with nearly 40,000 local pet stores across the U.S.\nTo realize this vision, Traini had to overcome two major challenges: data scarcity and environmental complexity . Traini addressed these through multimodal fusion , integrating image, video, and audio data to train its PPI (Pet Perception and Interaction) model. Powered by transformers, PPI combines real-time perception, adaptive reasoning, and feedback generation.\n\nTraini also introduced a \"train-as-you-use\" mechanism , where every anonymized user-pet interaction feeds back into model training, enhancing personalization and continuously expanding the behavioral dataset. This approach strengthens the model’s precision while building a sustainable data moat. Traini has achieved breakthroughs at both data and model levels , developing a rich, high-quality pet audio-video dataset across multiple breeds, scenes, and emotions. As a result, users can detect early signs of pet stress, loneliness, or health risks, transforming Traini from a passive tool into an emotional interface for daily companionship.\nInvestors describe Traini as a breakthrough example of AI in vertical applications—where technology, empathy, and consumer experience converge.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251229406590/en/\nContacts\ntrainipet@gmail.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nMeta Platforms' AI Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\nMeta Platforms is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META&rsquo;s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META&rsquo;s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms&rsquo; initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company&rsquo;s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet and Amazon , are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space\n\nMeta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\nAlphabet&rsquo;s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon&rsquo;s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nMETA&rsquo;s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\nMeta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 24.6%.\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s 6.62X. META has a Value Score of C.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.16 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, suggesting 1.75% year-over-year growth.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\n3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. , Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\nGlobal e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN&rsquo;s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon&rsquo;s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is &ldquo;Growing at a pace we haven&rsquo;t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we&rsquo;ve been focused on accelerating capacity &mdash; adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.&rdquo;\nExtensive AI Applications\n\nAmazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called &ldquo;Project Rainier.&rdquo; This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers&rsquo; queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\nAMZN&rsquo;s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance\nAmazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp.\nMicrosoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT&rsquo;s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company&rsquo;s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength\nMicrosoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN&rsquo;s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT&rsquo;s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company&rsquo;s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\n\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business\nGoogle Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon&rsquo;s AWS and Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\n\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions\nZacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

They have made bank in Mac 7. Uh not only this year, the year before and the year before that, maybe even a couple years before. They're they're sitting on a lot of gains is what I'm trying to say. What should they be doing right now with these gains?\n00:14 George\nGood morning, Brian. Can you imagine being a short seller in this market and trying to bet against the the Mag 7 or the AI trade or anything. I mean, you get carried out. Short selling's been like the worst uh possible thesis on the market you could have the last 15 years other than maybe going long oil and gas stocks. So I I I would not bet against any of any of these complexes, any of these movements. You want to talk about earnings growth, this market's got it. A lot of the other developed countries really don't. So betting against the US has been a fool's game and I'm certainly not going to be doing it in 2026. I'm going not I'm be going to not try to time the market. I'm going to try to stay in there, stay positions as is and just trim and reallocate as as wisdom would would dictate.\n01:05 Brian\nGeorge, I just had a a guest on uh I'm doing double duty here. I was in the 9:00 a.m. hour and they were making the case for healthcare. If you had to stack up these two sectors side by side, you got uh AI plays, you got the Mac 7, healthcare. What excites you more and why?\n01:22 George\nYeah, I don't really like any of those the best. I think healthcare's seen a significant rally in the closing parts of 2025. If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Broadcom, Vertiv and Alphabet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:58 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: VRT\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Broadcom AVGO, Vertiv VRT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n3 Leading AI Stocks Investors Can Buy for 2026\nThe market, and many leading AI stocks, are at an inflection point. In the near term, further volatility or even a pullback is possible. However, the longer-term opportunity remains compelling, with upside potential that extends well into 2026 and beyond.\n\nAI capital spending is projected to reach an estimated $571 billion in 2026, and Nvidia , Broadcom and Vertiv sit at the center of this historic infrastructure buildout. These companies are among the most critical enablers of the AI expansion.\nAfter running multiple screens focused on growth, valuation, and margin strength, these three names consistently rose to the top. Collectively, they represent exceptional businesses with durable competitive advantages and strong earnings power.\nDespite their leadership positions, these stocks are not stretched on valuation and in recent weeks have experienced earnings upgrades, giving two of them top Zacks Ranks.\nRecent months have been choppy in these stocks, with prices moving sideways to lower, leaving shares near technically important levels. Whether those levels hold or break in the short term is uncertain, but the risk-reward profile remains attractive at current prices regardless.\n\nEven if further downside materializes and bearish narratives resurface, any weakness is unlikely to persist given the scale and durability of AI-driven demand. If support holds, these stocks may already be positioning for their next leg higher.\nBelow, I will break down the recent developments, fundamental strength of these businesses and highlight a tactical trading plan using the technical charts.\nNvidia Stocks Breaks Out on Bullish Developments\nNvidia continues to anchor the AI boom as the critical infrastructure provider through its leadership in GPU technology. While 2025 was comparatively subdued for the now roughly $4.5 trillion semiconductor giant, with shares delivering a tidy 42% return, the company has remained firmly on offense.\nOver the past week, Nvidia advanced its largest acquisition to date, agreeing to acquire assets from AI chip startup Groq in a deal valued at approximately $20 billion. Groq, founded by former Google TPU architects, develops high-performance inference-focused silicon that competes in certain AI workloads. While Groq described the transaction as a &ldquo;non-exclusive licensing agreement,&rdquo; the deal includes the integration of Groq&rsquo;s CEO and senior leadership into Nvidia, signaling deeper strategic alignment.\n\nStory Continues\nFrom a competitive standpoint, the acquisition strengthens Nvidia&rsquo;s already formidable moat at the leading edge of AI semiconductors.\nFundamentals also continue to move in the right direction. Analysts have resumed raising earnings estimates, earning Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) . Consensus forecasts for next year&rsquo;s earnings have climbed nearly 16% over the past two months, and longer-term projections call for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years. At roughly 40.6x forward earnings, the valuation remains reasonable given Nvidia&rsquo;s growth profile and its central role in the most powerful technology cycle in more than a decade.\n\nThe technical picture has also improved meaningfully. After months of choppy, volatile trading marked by sharp rallies and pullbacks, NVDA has made a decisive bullish turn. During the low-volume holiday period, the stock broke out from a clear descending bullish wedge, marking its most constructive advance in several months. As long as shares hold above the breakout level, the setup points to further upside as 2026 begins.\nBroadcom Shares Consolidate at Key Price Level\nBroadcom has been a core beneficiary of the AI boom since the trend began, but its importance has become even more apparent in recent months. After being viewed as a relative laggard for several years, Alphabet has reasserted itself as a leader in AI and large language models. A major driver of that shift has been renewed appreciation for Alphabet&rsquo;s proprietary hardware stack, most notably its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which Google has deployed internally for nearly a decade.\n\nBroadcom plays a critical role in that ecosystem. While TPUs are branded as Google-designed chips, Broadcom provides the underlying expertise in ASIC design, networking, and high-speed I/O, effectively enabling Google to scale these systems reliably at hyperscale. As Alphabet rapidly expands AI infrastructure across Search, cloud services, and generative AI models, custom silicon becomes economically unavoidable. Broadcom sits squarely at the center of that transition, helping design chips optimized for inference, training, and internal workloads, areas where generic GPUs are often less cost-efficient. As Alphabet&rsquo;s AI leadership has become clearer, Broadcom&rsquo;s strategic importance has risen alongside it.\nFrom a fundamentals perspective, Broadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) , reflecting a pause in earnings revisions rather than any deterioration in outlook. Consensus estimates still call for 35.7% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, and the stock trades at roughly 36x one-year forward earnings. Given that growth profile and Broadcom&rsquo;s deep entrenchment in the AI infrastructure stack, valuation remains reasonable relative to peers.\n\nTechnically, Broadcom had been outperforming much of the AI complex in recent months as investors increasingly recognized its role within the Alphabet AI ecosystem. The sharp selloff following its most recent earnings report was less about weakening fundamentals and more about positioning and nuanced guidance, a classic &ldquo;sell-the-news&rdquo; event after a strong run. Importantly, shares found support at a level that has held up the stock since late summer. As long as that support holds, the consolidation looks constructive, and the near-term technical outlook remains encouraging.\nVertiv Stock Sits Within Trading Range\nVertiv remains one of the purest plays on the physical backbone of the AI buildout, supplying critical power, cooling, and thermal-management solutions to hyperscale and enterprise data centers. Recent developments continue to reinforce that positioning. Over the past several months, Vertiv has announced expanded partnerships with large data center operators and hyperscalers, while management has highlighted strong backlog growth and improving visibility tied directly to AI-driven capacity expansion. Demand for high-density cooling solutions continues to exceed expectations as next-generation AI workloads push power and thermal limits higher.\n\nFundamentally, the story remains compelling. Vertiv currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates continue to trend higher. Consensus forecasts call for 30.2% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, reflecting operating leverage, improving margins, and sustained AI-related demand. While the stock trades at a 40.6x forward earnings multiple, that valuation appears justified given Vertiv&rsquo;s growth rate, expanding addressable market, and increasingly important role in AI infrastructure.\nThe technical setup adds another layer of appeal. After a sharp advance earlier in the cycle, VRT has spent recent months consolidating within a well-defined trading range. Importantly, the stock recently bounced cleanly off support within its rising channel. The key level to watch on the upside is the ~$180 area, which marks the top of the current range. A decisive breakout above that level would likely signal the next leg higher, while continued support near the lower end of the channel keeps the risk-reward profile attractive.\n\nTaken together, Vertiv offers a differentiated way to participate in the AI boom&mdash;not through chips or software, but through the indispensable infrastructure that makes large-scale AI deployment possible. With fundamentals strengthening and the technical picture improving, VRT remains well positioned as investors look ahead to 2026.\nShould Investors Buy Shares in VRT, NVDA and AVGO?\nTaken together, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Vertiv offer complementary exposure to the core layers of the AI buildout&mdash;compute, custom silicon and networking, and physical infrastructure. While near-term volatility is always possible, fundamentals, earnings momentum, and long-term demand visibility remain firmly intact. With each stock positioned at a critical point in the AI value chain and trading near technically important levels, the current setup favors accumulation opportunistically as the AI investment cycle extends into 2026 and beyond.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The tail end of 2025 hasn’t been kind to the shares, as they are down by 7.9% since the start of November. The past couple of months have seen reports of an AI bubble, and the strength of Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) chips make rounds in the media. Google’s chips are cheaper to use than NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s products. However, more recently, the stock has benefited after reports have suggested that the firm will be able to ship its H200 GPUs to China. These chips have been a thorny issue in 2025 after the Trump administration restricted their sale.

Since it's an established and highly successful business, it's less risky than many hot tech stocks . Although it's already worth $3.8 trillion (as of Dec. 26), this company still has plenty of room to grow for one key reason.\nAlphabet is increasing its share of the AI market Once seen as a potential threat to Alphabet and its Google Search business, AI has become an important part of the tech giant's success. Google's AI assistant, Gemini, had 650 million monthly active users in the third quarter of 2025, according to Alphabet's earnings report. That's up from 450 million in July.\n\nIn that earnings report, Alphabet also reported that its first-party models, including Gemini, processed 7 billion tokens per minute. For perspective, OpenAI (the developer of ChatGPT) announced in October that its API platform processes 6 billion tokens per minute.\nThis is just one metric, and it's entirely possible that OpenAI soon announces it's processing 8 billion tokens per minute. Regardless, it's a sign that Google is attracting users to its AI products. Gemini's market share has also more than tripled over the last year, from 5.4% to 18.2%, according to Similarweb.\nAlphabet is integrating AI across all its business segments. Its most successful business in terms of revenue, Google Search, now offers AI Overviews and AI Mode. AI Overviews reached over 2 billion monthly users earlier this year. The tech giant also has AI-powered ad tools.\n\nAlphabet is one of the larger positions in my own portfolio, and I've added to it regularly. It's highly profitable (net income was $35 billion in Q3 2025), which provides a good degree of security, and its AI advancements set it up well for the future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Investing in These 3 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Right Now Could Set You Up for Life\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:57 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nWMT\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms continues to dominate with its social networks while exploring AI glasses, which can become a lucrative revenue stream.\nInteractive Brokers is one of the top beneficiaries of surging interest among investors who want to beat the stock market.\nWalmart's online ads continue to gain momentum and can yield higher profit margins in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Interactive Brokers Group ›\n\nInvesting in high-quality growth stocks and gradually building your positions can turn you into a millionaire investor. It takes a while to achieve that goal, and some people look beyond the S&P 500 index to amplify their returns. These are some of the most promising stocks that can produce appealing long-term returns.\nMeta Platforms is still a top-tier ad platform Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the second-largest advertising stock , only behind Google. However, Facebook's parent company has been reporting higher financial growth rates than Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which gives it an edge for new investors.\nTop-line results continue to expand, based on the company's 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter. Meta Platforms also recently launched its AI glasses, which may turn into a valuable revenue source that diversifies the company's finances in a few years.\n\nSocial media growth remains strong, with the company reporting 3.54 billion daily active users in Q3, which represents an 8% year-over-year increase. Continued demand for Meta Platforms' family of apps will yield more ad impressions and sales.\nInteractive Brokers is riding strong demand from investors When people make more stock trades and use margin to boost their exposure to equities, brokerage firms like Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ: IBKR) come out as the big winners. Shares are up by more than 40% year to date and have more than quadrupled over the past five years. Recent earnings results suggest that the momentum can continue.\n\nInteractive Brokers increased its total revenue by more than 20% year over year in Q3, with commission revenue and net interest income as two of the biggest winners. Strong engagement drove these results, with customer account growth increasing by 32% year over year. Interactive Brokers added 4.13 million accounts while delivering stock and options trading volume gains of 67% and 27% year over year, respectively.\nInvestors are still feeling good about the stock market based on a 39% year-over-year increase in Interactive Brokers' customer margin loans. Strong demand for the stock market should help the brokerage firm continue to outperform the S&P 500 and deliver millionaire-maker returns.\n\nStory Continues\nWalmart's pivot to advertising is a long-term tailwind that will boost margins Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) has made its mark as the world's top retailer and has a real shot at exceeding a $1 trillion market cap in 2026. The company continues to boost sales and delivered 5.8% year-over-year revenue growth for investors in Q3 FY26.\nHowever, the company's advertising segment is addressing one of Walmart's biggest weaknesses. Walmart enjoys high order volumes but struggles with profit margins. The company's net margins usually hover near 3% since retail stocks aren't known for high margins. Ads can be a game changer, especially since Walmart reported 53% year-over-year revenue growth for its global advertising business.\n\nAds don't make up a large portion of Walmart's total business, but they can grow over time and boost margins. In the meantime, Walmart continues to gain market share in retail while expanding its e-commerce sales, which were up by 27% year over year. Each Walmart store acts as a distribution facility, which results in lower shipping costs and quicker deliveries.\nFew companies can compete with Walmart in terms of size, and that works well for investors who want millionaire-maker stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Interactive Brokers Group right now? Before you buy stock in Interactive Brokers Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Interactive Brokers Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Are These 2 Quantum Computing Stocks the Key to Decades of Wealth?\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nIONQ\n\nKey Points Investors who want to capitalize on the future of quantum computing have a few options.\nEven as it pushes ahead in AI, Alphabet is making notable headway in quantum computing.\nIonQ is a pure-play quantum stock that could prove compelling for some long-term investors.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nQuantum computing is a promising field with massive long-term potential, but it is still in its early commercialization phase. This can make investing in quantum computing businesses a high-risk, high-reward proposition suitable for only a small portion of a diversified portfolio.\nInvestors can approach this sector in two primary ways: through established tech giants or pure-play start-ups. The former offer a more stable entry point, as quantum computing is only a small part of their diversified operations. This approach can limit the impact of quantum-specific volatility on your overall investment.\nOn the other hand, pure-play quantum computing stocks can be highly speculative, early-stage companies whose stock prices are often volatile and tied to technological breakthroughs and future potential rather than current profits, but which could deliver higher returns if successful.\nOn today's list, I've included one quantum computing stock from each bucket for long-term investors to consider. Let's dive right in.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , through its Google Quantum AI division, is a leader in developing quantum computing technology focused on creating a large-scale, error-corrected quantum computer for solving problems currently impossible for classical supercomputers. Its recent work has led to significant breakthroughs, including the Willow quantum chip.\n\nThe Willow chip, unveiled in late 2024, has achieved two major milestones. First, it can significantly reduce error rates as more qubits (quantum bits, the basic units of quantum information) are added, which is a crucial step for building a scalable and reliable quantum computer. In October 2025, Google Quantum AI announced a breakthrough algorithm called Quantum Echoes run on the Willow hardware that generated a calculation demonstrably faster (13,000x) than any classical supercomputer.\nThe algorithm also achieved verifiable quantum advantage, which means it is repeatable and can be checked by other quantum systems. The work on the Quantum Echoes algorithm is a major step toward practical applications.\nPotential uses range from drug discovery and medicine to materials science. Google Quantum AI is pursuing a six-milestone roadmap to build a large error-corrected quantum computer with a goal of 1 million qubits. The division regularly collaborates with universities and national labs to provide access to their processors via the Google Cloud platform.\n\nStory Continues\nUnlike smaller pure-play quantum computing companies that require constant fundraising, Alphabet can leverage immense profits from its core advertising and Google Cloud businesses to fund decades of research without pressure for immediate commercial viability. A key challenge in quantum computing is error correction. The Willow chip was designed to exponentially reduce errors as qubits are added, which is a major technical advance over competitors.\n\nThe company's vision includes integrating future quantum computing capabilities into its existing AI ecosystem and Google Cloud platforms. In the third quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew 16% year over year to $102.3 billion, and net income climbed 33% to about $35 billion. The company is also a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), which is driving real business results and driving heavy investment in data centers and custom chips.\nAlphabet maintains a virtually unassailable financial position, with a strong balance sheet including $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities , and low debt too. Long-term investors who want to add wealth-building stocks to their portfolio should certainly consider taking a position in this business.\n\n2. IonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) IonQ is a leading pure-play quantum computing company that utilizes trapped-ion technology to build high-performance quantum systems. Unlike competitors like Alphabet and International Business Machines that primarily use superconducting qubits, IonQ's approach leverages naturally occurring, identical trapped ions as qubits.\n\nBy using naturally stable atoms that are isolated in a vacuum, IonQ's qubits are less susceptible to environmental noise and decoherence. In short, this can lead to fewer errors and more reliable results.\nIn October 2025, IonQ achieved 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, a critical industry benchmark that essentially means its quantum computers can perform complex operations with extremely high accuracy. Every qubit in an IonQ system can directly interact with any other qubit. This slashes the computational overhead and errors required to move data between qubits.\nIonQ is actively collaborating with partners to solve complex problems in several sectors. The company is working on accelerated drug development workflows with companies like AstraZeneca and Nvidia , it's partnered with Hyundai to use quantum AI for image recognition in self-driving cars, and even collaborated with Airbus to optimize high-complexity cargo loading problems.\n\nIonQ operates with an evolving business model that's designed to monetize its proprietary trapped ion technology through three primary avenues. One is through QCaaS, or Quantum Computing as a Service, a cloud-based model that lets major cloud providers like Amazon , Microsoft , and Google access quantum hardware, software, and tools remotely, much like traditional cloud services.\nAnother revenue source involves partnering with government agencies and enterprises for specialized quantum applications. IonQ is also expanding into quantum networking, sensing, and security after strategic 2025 acquisitions like Oxford Ionics and Vector Atomic.\nIn Q3, IonQ's revenue surged 222% year over year to $39.9 million. The company reported a substantial GAAP net loss of $1.1 billion, largely due to non-cash charges related to warrant liabilities and acquisition costs. Following a $2 billion equity offering in October, IonQ holds a pro forma cash balance of $3.5 billion and carries zero long-term debt.\n\nIonQ could enrich long-term investors if it successfully transitions from a high-growth speculative play to a dominant utility in the quantum era. It is currently the only pure-play public quantum company with triple-digit annual revenue growth and widespread cloud integration.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia's \"Aqui-Hire\" of Groq Eliminates a Potential Competitor and Marks Its Entrance Into the Non-GPU, AI Inference Chip Space\n\nBeth McKenna, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 12:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia is entering into a non-exclusive licensing agreement for Groq’s AI inference technology.\nNvidia's reportedly paying $20 billion for this deal, about three times Groq's most recent valuation.\nGroq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross -- who will join Nvidia along with other Groq personnel -- is widely considered the creator of Google’s TPU.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOn Friday, artificial intelligence (AI) chip start-up Groq announced via a very brief press release that it \"has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) for Groq's inference technology.\"\nThe deal also includes Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, Sunny Madra, Groq's president, and other members of the Groq team joining Nvidia to \"help advance and scale the licensed technology.\"\nThis was a smart move by Nvidia, in my view. Nvidia has tons of cash, and it makes sense to use it to accomplish two goals at once: eliminate a potential competitor and obtain a new chip technology to offer its customers.\nHere's what investors should know.\nAs close to an acquisition as it gets That Nvidia is not only entering into a non-exclusive license with Groq, but also hiring its founder-CEO, president, and reportedly key engineering talent, makes this deal an \"acqui-hire\" and as close to a full-fledged acquisition as possible.\nGranted, Groq will reportedly continue to operate, with its CFO taking over the CEO position, and operate its GroqCloud. However, with the founder -- who is the mastermind behind the company's tech -- leaving, it appears that all advancements in Groq's tech will now be made under Nvidia.\n\nNo doubt, Nvidia structured the deal to avoid potential regulatory scrutiny. The company already dominates the AI chip space, so any acquisition that could potentially increase its current or future market share further would likely garner a very close look from regulators.\nNvidia-Groq deal size The deal's size wasn't disclosed by the companies involved, but one major financial outlet has reported it at $20 billion, which would be Nvidia's largest deal to date, by far. Its prior largest deal was its $6.9 billion acquisition of high-performance networking specialist Mellanox Technologies in 2020. That acquisition proved to be extremely successful, as Nvidia's networking business is booming.\nIf the $20 billion is accurate, it represents a huge premium over Groq's most recent valuation. After a $750 million financing round in September, Groq's valuation was $6.9 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia tried to buy leading central processing unit (CPU) chip designer Arm Holdings in 2020, but that massive deal was called off due to significant antitrust concerns from regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nGroq's chip technology Groq's chips are language processing units (LPUs) designed for AI inferencing. Inferencing is the second step in the two-step AI process, following training. Training involves using vast amounts of data to teach an AI model, while inference is the deployment of that model to generate answers to a user's questions, images, and other outputs.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long dominated the AI training stage. They're also leaders in AI inference, but they face growing competition in this area. Competitors include Advanced Micro Devices ' (AMD) data center GPUs, as well as custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that Broadcom and Marvell Technology are making for big tech company customers. Until now, the big tech companies have just used their custom AI chips internally and, where applicable, also in their cloud computing services.\nHowever, it was recently revealed that social media giant Meta Platforms is considering buying Alphabet 's Google custom AI chip, called a tensor processing unit (TPU), for inferencing purposes in its data centers.\n\nThe big tech companies are exploring alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs for two reasons: to reduce costs and to diversify their supply chains. Relying on just a single supplier for anything can be risky.\nGroq's goal was for its LPUs to be a big player in the AI inference market. The company claims its technology is faster than alternatives for specific inference applications. Its plans included selling its chips for less money than Nvidia GPUs and perhaps other offerings.\nIt makes good sense that Nvidia views Groq's tech as potentially very valuable and evidently viewed the company as a potential, significant future rival. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross is widely considered the creator of Google's TPU. Granted, he didn't create this chip alone, but he was the force behind the effort to develop it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "2026 will be 'year of autonomous': Analyst on Tesla, Waymo robotaxis\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: LYFT\n\nTSLA\n\nUBER\n\nGOOG\n\n2026 is on the road to being the \"year of autonomous\" driving as Tesla ( TSLA ) and the Alphabet-owned Waymo ( GOOG , GOOGL ) seek to expand their robotaxi services to other major US cities.\nWedbush Securities managing director of equity research Scott Devitt weighs in on the biggest themes and investing plays around self-driving technology, and how he sees 2026 playing out for rideshare companies Uber ( UBER ) and Lyft ( LYFT ).\n\nCatch Scott Devitt's top three consumer internet stock picks heading into 2026.\nAlso watch Yahoo Finance's interview with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign associate professor Katherine Driggs-Campbell about the recent behavior shifts in autonomous vehicles' driving habits\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nSo talk to me a little bit about how you're seeing these themes going into 2026. Robo taxi, AI.\n00:10 Speaker B\nAutonomous is going to be it's going to be the year of autonomous. You know, frankly, particularly in the US with the expansion of Waymo into uh as many as 20 markets in 2026. Our estimate for uh Tesla is that it it enters 30 US markets by the end of 2026 and you're beginning to really see the early stages of a transition from uh human human-driven activity to one that's run by robots. and it's very exciting. It's good for society, it's good for um the health of consumers given that it lowers traffic uh deaths and uh and incidence rates. And so I think autonomous is something that could be a headwind for companies I cover, Lyft and Uber in some ways. Um could be beneficial in other ways and certainly will will be good for Waymo and Tesla. On the AI side, you know, a lot of the the benefits the past two to three years in terms of security prices have come with infrastructure plays. I think you're going to start to see a transition more towards use cases, the enterprise and consumer use cases. And um, you know, these things kind of being found in the wild now and starting to see the ability to quantify uh the returns. Meta's been an early beneficiary of incorporation of AI into the business. I think you'll see more companies as well in 26.\n02:08 Speaker A\nAnd looking at Lyft and Uber, I mean, Uber has done well this year. Uh and I'm curious, is that because of robo taxi uh and and how you see the competition between some of these players uh shaking out? I mean, you've got Waymo that has done so well, and then you've got Tesla that is also making advancements and Tesla which touched all-time highs this year. So I I guess I'm just curious as to how you see it all shaking out within those players.\n02:44 Speaker B\nSo Uber and the performance year to date, it's a little tricky because it did underperform exiting 2024 on fears of autonomous and then recovered this year as it, you know, as autonomous has has been, you know, uh held at bay and hasn't really impacted anyone's business quite yet. And so I I think that that that performance looked over an extended period of time called the next 18 months, Uber's been relatively flat. You know, I think Uber as a company is a bit more insulated than Lyft because it has a delivery business for restaurants as well, which is about half of the gross bookings, and also has a significant business outside the US. In the US, you know, autonomous is ramping quickly and I think it's going only going to accelerate on an S-curve type uh pattern in 2026 and that really exposes Lyft which has over 90% of its gross bookings in the US and and so I think that you're going to start to see the effects of that in the share price which has also done well um this year in 25 could come to an end in 26.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Oscars to air on YouTube: What it means for media industry\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Josh Lipton\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: GOOG\n\nDIS\n\nThe Oscars will be streaming on Alphabet-owned ( GOOG , GOOGL ) YouTube, rather than Disney-owned ( DIS ) ABC, starting in 2029. The shift marks a win for streaming over traditional cable television.\n\"The Ankler\" awards editor Katey Rich explains what the Oscars' move to YouTube means for the media industry.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThe Oscars will stream live for free on YouTube starting in 2029, leaving its longtime home of ABC.\n00:10 Speaker A\nThe deal will run through at least 2033. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reached a deal to broadcast the ceremony, as well as behind the scenes content and red carpet coverage for free on the streaming platform.\n00:23 Speaker A\nThe Oscars are the first major award show to decamp from linear and cable TV for streaming.\n00:30 Speaker A\nFor more, I'm joined now by Katie Rich, the Ankle Awards editor.\n00:35 Speaker A\nKatie, is good to see you. Um, maybe start at a at a high level, Katie, for those of us who don't follow this as closely, you know, the Oscar's moving to YouTube, Katie, why is that such a big deal for Hollywood and and media companies and and media investors? Give us the context.\n00:53 Katie Rich\nWell, Hollywood and digital streaming services and tech in general have a complicated relationship. You know, there's tech companies making their way into Hollywood.\n01:03 Katie Rich\nYouTube has certainly been among them, more on the television side than making anything that you would call films that would be eligible for Oscars. And there's been this growing sense not only that these tech companies are trying to take over more of the industry, but with the ABC, with ABC airing the Oscars, the ratings for it had been going down over the years, just part of the way that audience attention works in no small part thanks to these tech companies.\n01:24 Katie Rich\nSo, ABC had been paying around $100 million to license the Oscars every year, and there has been some reporting that they were looking to spend a little bit less. And then YouTube, constantly trying to maybe prove itself, get a little bit more credibility within Hollywood, I think saw an opportunity and said, okay, we'll be the steward for the Oscars for at least four years.\n01:42 Speaker A\nAnd why, Katie, do you think the Academy chose YouTube? Why that platform? Because reportedly there were there were others, right? Netflix.\n01:49 Katie Rich\nIt's possible that they paid the most, which is certainly no small thing. But there's also the way that the Academy considers itself is kind of a neutral arbiter within Hollywood. You know, it wants to give everyone a fair treatment. It wants all of these studios and streamers and everyone to kind of come to their table, compete for the Oscars, and really just be kind of a home for celebration of good cinema, no matter where it is.\n02:11 Katie Rich\nSo Netflix is obviously a huge player. They're airing the Screen actors Guild Awards, which were recently renamed the Actor Awards, but Netflix also makes movies that compete in the Oscar race.\n02:22 Katie Rich\nSo there's a way that YouTube is sort of a a neutral uh third party that can be in the middle of it. And also in terms of the global reach that they're talking about, Netflix is a global company, of course, but YouTube is just everywhere. It's a link that you can send to anyone you in your life and make sure they can see it. They've emphasized over and over again in announcing this, how they want to expand the audience for the Oscars around the world, and YouTube has that infiltration that basically nobody else does.\n02:45 Speaker A\nAnd for a streamer like YouTube, Katie, how impactful can an event like the Oscars be? I mean, how how impactful can it be for for eyeballs and subscribers and ad dollars?\n02:55 Katie Rich\nI mean, YouTube certainly doesn't lack for eyeballs. They are probably getting more of of people around the world's attention than any studio currently. But in terms of prestige, in terms of saying, you know, we're not just a place where you can look up a video for how to fix your washing machine or watch Mr. Beast, we can be somewhere that stars want to be part of.\n03:09 Katie Rich\nYou know, YouTube has not really made high profile celebrity driven shows the way that say Apple or Netflix or Amazon have. So this is sort of their way of saying, we're not just the every, you know, the everything place, the platform for absolutely anything you want to find, but we're somewhere where you can, you know, celebrate really the great things in culture.\n03:28 Katie Rich\nSo in terms of advertisers, you know, Rolex has partnered with the Academy for years and years. I wonder if that would be an advertiser that would work on YouTube that wouldn't otherwise. You know, the plan doesn't start till 2029, so there's a lot of details left to work out, but I would imagine on YouTube side of thing, the prestige is maybe more of a draw than the eyeballs themselves.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "California tech founders unload on a proposed state wealth tax that already has some billionaires preparing an escape. ‘I am screwed for life’\n\nJason Ma\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nA proposed wealth tax aimed at billionaires hasn&#8217;t yet qualified for California&#8217;s ballot, but it&#8217;s already sparked intense pushback from tech founders in the state.\nIt started when the New York Times reported that venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google cofounder Larry Page were looking into leaving California in case the tax becomes law.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents part of Silicon Valley, flagged the story on X and echoed President Franklin Roosevelt by adding &#8220;I will miss them very much.&#8221;\nThe proposal calls for California residents worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax equivalent to 5% of their assets that can be paid over five years.\nThe wealth tax&#8217;s backers, who want to use the revenue to help offset federal funding cuts for healthcare, must still gather enough signatures before it can get on the ballot in November 2026.\nWhile Khanna is a member of Congress and not a California state lawmaker, his support for the wealth tax unleashed a flood of negative reactions.\nPalmer Luckey, cofounder of defense tech startup Anduril, warned the tax would force founders to sell big pieces of their companies to pay for &#8220;fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.&#8221;\n\nIf he and his wealthy peers can&#8217;t come up with billions of dollars in cash to pay the tax, he said the state could seize his home and garnish his wages.\n&#8220;One market correction, nationalization event, or prohibition of divestiture (not at all uncommon during wartime) and I am screwed for life,&#8221; Luckey posted on X .\nOf particular concern is how the potential wealth tax might treat paper profits from stock gains and stakes in companies that haven&#8217;t gone public, a key form of compensation among startups that have yet to turn profitable.\nFigma cofounder and CEO Dylan Field pointed out that founders and potentially early employees could get caught up in the wealth tax but wouldn&#8217;t be able to use company stock to pay it. Some founders may also have to pay capital gains taxes, meaning they would face a &#8220;double tax event.&#8221;\n\nAnd in the event a startup has an unsuccessful year, founders still on the hook for the wealth tax may be forced to lower their startup&#8217;s valuation via a &#8220;down round&#8221; that would make it harder to draw talent and investors; take out a loan that they may have trouble repaying; or leave California.\n&#8220;Silicon Valley startups (ironically) follow the herd. Once enough respected companies/founders establish a pattern, other startups will follow, even if the wealth tax does not apply to them yet,&#8221; Field posted on X .\n\nStory Continues\nFor his part, Khanna said he opposes capital gains taxes on unrealized income and supports workarounds for founders with illiquid assets and unprofitable companies.\nHe also said tax dollars helped build the AI industry and dismissed the idea that tech entrepreneurs wouldn’t start companies in the state due to a 1% per-year tax, adding that innovators are drawn to the area’s talent.\n\n“We cannot have a nation with extreme concentration of wealth in a few places but where 70 percent of Americans believe the American dream is dead and healthcare, childcare, housing, education is unaffordable,” he said on X . “What will stifle American innovation, what will make us fall behind China, is if we see further political dysfunction and social unrest, if we fail to cultivate the talent in every American and in every city and town.”\nBut Dave Friedberg, cofounder and CEO of Ohalo Genetics, said the wealth tax still amounts to an &#8220;organized government seizure of private property from citizens&#8221; who have already paid other taxes that can total 53% in California.\nHe said the tax flirts with socialism and represents &#8220;a slippery slope that has never gone anywhere good (see economic effects in USSR, Cuba, Venezuela, France and Norway wealth tax etc.)&#8221;\nGarry Tan, CEO of tech startup accelerator Y Combinator, told the New York Post that the wealth tax would drive capital out of the state, hurt innovation, and eventually weaken support for healthcare services.\n“This measure would cause a stampede of unicorns out of California to other states, which would reap the benefits of entrepreneurs, technology and jobs that California enjoys now,” he added.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 844% over that stretch.\nEven after such a monumental gain, this growth stock continues to crush the market, soaring 64% just in 2025. Alphabet is a monster business with a $3.75 trillion market cap. Nonetheless, investors might still want to consider buying shares.\nAlphabet possesses powerful competitive advantages It's not an accident that the company's stock has done so well. This is one of the best businesses on the face of the planet. One of the most important reasons comes down to the economic moat . Alphabet possesses many durable competitive strengths that play to its advantage, giving it a dominant position in the industries it operates in.\n\nNetwork effects are certainly at play. Google Search is constantly getting better, as more queries generate more data that's always refining the algorithm. YouTube is a two-sided ecosystem, with a higher number of viewers and engagement drawing in more content creators, which then improves the user experience. These are positive feedback loops that are hard to stop.\n\"With 15 products that each serve half a billion people, and six that serve over 2 billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in July 2023.\nThere might be no company out there that collects more data than Alphabet. This is a powerful advantage in today's internet economy. Imagine the vast amounts of data that the business can leverage to enhance its various apps. This data also helps train Alphabet's artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nGoogle Cloud benefits both from a cost advantage and from switching costs . Sizable fixed investments are required to scale up the infrastructure needed to serve cloud customers.\nGoogle Cloud was unprofitable for quite some time. However, now it's producing robust profits. And its customers, who have integrated their own workflows with Google Cloud, are discouraged from changing providers unless they want to disrupt their operations and deal with training and onboarding employees to a new system.\n\nStory Continues\nAssume you're a highly motivated, extremely skilled, very resourceful, and well-funded tech entrepreneur. Your mission is to disrupt Alphabet's key segments, including Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. Where do you even begin?\nIt's an almost impossible task that underscores just how dominant this company has become. And for long-term investors, it makes Alphabet a less risky opportunity, since it seems to always be in a position of power.\n\nWhat about the stock's valuation? Successful businesses, especially those with massive market caps like this one, don't fly under the radar. That's why it might come as a surprise that Alphabet's shares aren't expensive today. Investors interested in adding this growth stock to their portfolios are being asked by the market to pay a price-to-earnings ratio of 30.6.\n\nThat's more expensive than the S&P 500. And it's a 23% premium to Alphabet's trailing-five-year average. But the quality of this company is worth the price tag.\nAlphabet is humming along. Revenue in Q3 2025 (ended Sept. 30) increased 16% year over year to $102 billion, with net income rising at a faster rate of 33%.\nThe business has its foot on the gas pedal in the AI race, with forecasted capital expenditures this year of $91 billion to $93 billion, a sizable sum. Alphabet is planning to introduce ads on its Gemini app , which has 650 million monthly active users. This could bring incremental revenue to the mix, giving the company a clear path to monetize all its free AI users.\nSometimes investment opportunities just hit you over the head with how obvious they are. Alphabet is precisely that right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nvidia Stock Had a Volatile 2025: What’s the 2026 Forecast?\n\nMohit Oberoi\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nNvidia stock (NVDA) is up 41.88% year-to-date and is the second-best performing constituent of the “Magnificent 7” stocks, trailing only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), whose 2025 price action surprised even some of the bulls. While Nvidia’s 2025 returns – which are well above twice the average S&P 500 Index ($SPX) constituent – would look stellar, they pale in front of the triple-digit returns that it delivered in the previous two years.\n\nNvidia stock was quite volatile this year and plunged to $86.62 on April 7 amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The rebound was also quick, though, and the stock has more than doubled from its 2025 lows even as it is down 11.37% from the record high of $212.19 in late October.\nMore News from Barchart The Next Market Collapse Will Be Quiet And That Is Exactly Why Investors Will Miss It\nNvidia Stock Is ‘Ripe’ for Gains in 2026, According to This Top Analyst\nThe Saturday Spread: Using Risk Topography to Plan Your Options Strategies (JD, NTAP, ZS)\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\nNvidia Announced Multiple Deals in 2025 Nvidia went on a deal-making spree in 2025, announcing a flurry of investments. Among others, it reported an investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI, $5 billion in Intel (INTC), $10 billion in Anthropic, $1 billion in Nokia (NOK), $2 billion in Synopsis (SNPS), and also participated in funding rounds of several other companies this year. In addition, it committed to invest two billion British pounds in AI startups in the U.K. as well as reportedly investing $2 billion in Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nMore recently, Nvidia struck a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq in a deal that is said to be valued at $20 billion, making it the biggest ever deal for the Jensen Huang-led company. Meanwhile, in an apparent bid to evade regulatory scrutiny, the deal has been structured as an “inference technology licensing agreement,” which would see the Groq founder, president, and other employees join Nvidia.\nUncertainty Over Nvidia’s China Business Another defining feature for Nvidia this year was the continued uncertainty over its China business. The Trump administration barred the company from exporting H20 chips to the Communist country. While later it approved their exports in exchange for a 15% cut in revenues, Nvidia’s China sales all but evaporated after the country cautioned domestic companies against using these chips over potential backdoors.\n\nNow, the U.S. government has allowed exports of the more powerful H200 chips, albeit with an even fatter revenue cut of 25%, and reports suggest that this time around, the demand for these chips is quite strong. However, Democratic lawmakers have called upon the administration to disclose the license applications of Chinese companies looking to buy these chips. The H200 is more powerful than the H20, whose exports were ostensibly blocked over “national security” concerns. So we can be sure of a political slugfest over its exports, given the “civil-military” fusion in the world’s second biggest economy.\n\nStory Continues\nNVDA Stock Forecast Nvidia’s mean target price of $256 is over 34.36% higher than the current price levels. Dan Ives of Wedbush, a permabull on tech stocks, believes that $250 is the base case target for Nvidia by the end of this year, whereas Evercore ISI has the Street-high target price of $352 on the stock, making for a potential 84.75% upside.\nConsensus estimates call for Nvidia’s revenues to rise 63% to $213.2 billion in the current fiscal year, which would end in January 2026, and then rise by almost 50% to $319 billion in the next fiscal year. There could be more upside to these already splendid numbers if Nvidia’s China business gets back on track. Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 42.9x while its P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiple is 0.92, which makes it the only Magnificent 7 constituent to have a PEG multiple below 1.\n\nTo be sure, there are concerns over a potential AI bubble and rising competition in the AI chip market, with even some of Nvidia’s biggest customers like Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN) selling their own chips to third parties.\nOverall, Nvidia appears to have another strong year ahead, and while investors should temper their expectations and not expect triple-digit annual returns in perpetuity, the stock should continue to create investor wealth as it has been doing for the last several years.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: NVDA, INTC, GOOG, AMZN.

      "Content": "'I don't see a bubble': Why Wall Street thinks the stock market can keep climbing even as AI anxiety grows\n\nInes Ferré · Senior Business Reporter\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nAs stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\nAt least for now.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks ( XLK ).\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia ( NVDA ) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq ( GROQ.PVT ).\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google ( GOOG ) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \" One Big Beautiful Bill \" that passed this year and the AI boom.\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile most of the earnings growth this year has been led by the largest seven stocks in the S&P 500, Goldman Sachs analysts also see participation broadening.\n\"We expect macro tailwinds from accelerating economic growth and a fading tariff drag on margins will support an acceleration in the earnings growth rate for the remaining 493 stocks,\" wrote Goldman's Ben Snider earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, AI productivity is expected to lift earnings for companies outside the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks, said Joseph Shaposhnik, founder of Rainwater Equity.\n\"I think some of them will take a break — some of them will perform well,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\"But really, the opportunity for outsized returns next year are going to be outside those seven businesses,\" he added.\nInes Ferre is a Senior Business Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "‘Normies’ lose interest in crypto, but advocates say ‘10-year Bitcoin grind’ will pay off\n\nTim Alper\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 3:14 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nGOOG\n\nPopular interest in Bitcoin and crypto is bottoming out as the year’s end approaches, search engine data indicates.\nThe podcaster and crypto advocate Mario Nawfal wrote on X that there is “close to no retail interest in crypto right now.”\n“None of my normie friends or family ask me anything about crypto anymore,” Nawfal wrote, posting a screenshot of a chart showing a sharp drop in Google searches for the term “crypto.”\n\nThe drop in interest coincides with sluggish Bitcoin price performance and dashed hopes of a “Santa rally” on the markets over Christmas.\n‘Normies’ losing interest Google’s Google Trends data hub records search interest changes on a scale from zero to 100. At the time of writing, global searches for “Bitcoin” stand at just 19, a six-month low, and just a single point above 2025’s low of 18, recorded in mid-June.\nSearches for “crypto” have also crashed from over 50 at the start of the month to just 25 on December 28.\n\nEvidence suggests the trend is not limited to Google. In South Korea, where Naver is the dominant search engine, similar trends have taken root.\nOn a similar 0-100 scale, Naver searches for “Bitcoin” have dropped from a mid-month high of 46 to just 15 on December 28, with “cryptocurrency” experiencing a similar slump.\nOther indicators make equally grim reading, with CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index, a market sentiment measurement tool, locked firmly in the “fear” zone.\nAnother Fear and Greed Index, run by South Korea’s Upbit Data Lab, meanwhile, shows sentiment hovering between the “Fear” and “Neutral” ranges.\nMemecoin hype fades Nawfal said that memecoin losses have taken their toll on retail investors’ confidence.\n“Do we need to start pumping the dino coins again to get retail to come back?” Nawfal mused. “After the Trump/Melania memecoin drama, it seems that retail lost a lot of faith in the space.”\nOfficial Trump, a coin introduced by US President Donald Trump, has seen its market cap slump from a January high of over $9 billion to under $1 billion in late December. Official Melania, the First Lady’s coin, has fared no better.\n\nBut, in an interview with CNBC , Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of the crypto investment provider Bitwise Asset Management, said Bitcoin was likely to bounce back in the long term, and that the first signs of recovery would emerge next year.\n“I think the four-year [Bitcoin price] cycle is being replaced by a 10-year grind,” Hougan said. “I mean, there are big new forces in the world.”\nThese forces, he explained, were the emergence of crypto exchange-traded funds , progressive regulation in the US, and “the growth of stablecoins and tokenisation.”\n\nStory Continues\n“I think those forces are bigger and stronger than the forces that historically caused the four-year cycle ,” Hougan said. “So, specifically, I expect the market to be up next year.”\nHowever, the Bitwise executive warned that meteoric price rises were unlikely in 2026. “It’s not spectacular returns,” he said. “[More like] strong returns, lower volatility, [with] some ups and downs.”\nTim Alper is a news correspondent at DL News.

      "Content": "2 Unstoppable AI Stocks That Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Own\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon is set for a comeback in 2026, helped by its cloud computing segment.\nAlphabet answered a ton of questions about the future of its business in 2025.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAlthough Warren Buffett is on his way out as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , studying his stock picks is a smart move for investors. He's known to be a value investor and only picks stocks that he understands, so when artificial intelligence (AI) companies show up in Berkshire Hathaway'w portfolio, investors would be wise to pay attention.\nTwo AI stocks Berkshire owns that I'm excited about are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Both of these stocks look primed to soar higher in 2026, and I think they make for excellent investments right now.\nBuffett may not have bought these stocks Although Buffett has been the primary money manager at Berkshire Hathaway, there are others who also have management over some funds. Todd Combs (who now works for JPMorgan ) and Ted Weschler ran a portion of the Berkshire portfolio and were known to invest in more tech-centric stocks than Buffett did. So, it's possible that the Amazon and Alphabet purchases were made under their direction.\n\nAlphabet is Berkshire's most recent purchase, and accounts for about 1.7% of its total portfolio. Amazon is a far older holding, and Berkshire has owned shares since 2019, although it only makes up 0.7% of its portfolio. With the size of the positions in Berkshire's investment portfolio, Buffett likely gave them the thumbs up to purchase these shares. So even if they weren't originally his purchase, he has still hung on to them.\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet look like great investments right now, so I'd be surprised if Berkshire were looking to pivot away from them.\nAlphabet and Amazon look primed to soar in 2026 Alphabet has had a great 2025, while Amazon's has been lackluster. Alphabet's stock is up around 60%, while Amazon's is nearly flat, rising only 3%.\nAlphabet's stellar performance comes after many doubted it could be successful in the artificial intelligence realm at the start of the year. There were concerns about Alphabet being broken up for a monopoly, falling behind in generative AI technology, and its cash cow, Google Search, being replaced by generative AI. However, none of those investment theses panned out in 2025, which is why the stock soared.\nThese same points that allowed it to soar in 2025 shoould continue in 2026, allowing Alphabet to continue down its path of dominance next year. With Alphabet leading the way in generative AI after trailing for so long, it opens up new revenue streams that could trickle in.\n\nStory continues\nFurthermore, it's potentially selling its custom AI chip, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), as an alternative to graphics processing units (GPUs) on the open market for the first time. So 2026 could be a monster year for Alphabet, and owning shares like Berkshire is a smart move.\nAmazon's lackluster 2025 isn't on account of its business. Amazon has grown quickly for its size, with revenue rising 13% in the third quarter. The highlight of its sprawling business is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit. AWS is a critical part of Amazon, as it accounts for 66% of operating income despite making up just 18% of revenue.\n\nFurthermore, AWS just posted its fastest growth quarter in multiple years, which should have gotten the market excited about its prospects. However, the market mostly ignored Amazon in 2025, setting it up for success in 2026.\nI think Amazon could easily be the comeback stock of the year in 2026, and its dominance in the cloud computing realm, as well as its content strength in the commerce business, support that prospect. Buffett may be on his way out at Berkshire Hathaway, but his investment picks remain. With Alphabet and Amazon still being fairly large holdings, it's another vote of confidence for these two stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nDebitMyData Lays the Foundation for the Human Energy Grid: Preparing the Workforce for the AI Economy and Unlocking a Compliant Future for Data Center Expansion\n\nDebit My Data, Inc.\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 11:43 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nDebitMyData Human Energy Grid\n\nDebitMyData Custom Logo and Facial Recognition DebitMyData™ Logo\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Dec. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As AI accelerates beyond human employment capacity and public trust erodes under massive data center expansion, DebitMyData, Inc. is building the missing bridge — the human and digital foundation for the next economy.\nBefore governments acted, before the Genesis Executive Order ignited a national push for ethical AI infrastructure, DebitMyData was already designing the architecture that would realign labor, data, and energy into a unified human-first ecosystem.\n\nDebitMyData.com is the first layer of that ecosystem: a strategic platform preparing today’s workforce for the Creator Economy, where displaced workers regain agency through verified digital identity, direct data monetization, and participation in the coming Human Energy Grid — the trust and compliance layer that will enable hyperscalers like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft to expand ethically and transparently. Watch: DebitMyData Human Energy Grid .\nThe Crisis: Billions Spent, Projects Stalled\nSince 2022, the world’s largest AI companies have pledged more than $200 billion to build data centers powering generative intelligence. Yet projects remain paralyzed across multiple jurisdictions — halted by community opposition, regulatory confusion, and growing fears that “AI progress” benefits only corporations, not citizens.\n\nDebitMyData’s solution reframes the equation.\nBy valuing human participation in data exchange, energy contribution, and consent verification, the Human Energy Grid introduces an economic model where infrastructure growth yields tangible local and individual benefits — aligning corporate expansion with community trust.\n“Before the Genesis Order, we already understood the next frontier,” said Preska Thomas,, Founder and CEO of DebitMyData, Inc. “The challenge isn’t building more compute — it’s building more trust. Without societal consent and economic inclusion, the AI revolution can’t scale sustainably.”\nPhase One: Building the Workforce Trust Layer\nDebitMyData.com serves as the activation point. Through it, the company is organizing and credentialing a next-generation digital workforce — those displaced or at risk from AI automation — into the coming grid economy.\n\nParticipants gain:\nVerified Digital Identities (DID): Anchored in secure, LLM-backed protocols enabling individuals to control, monetize, and consent to their data usage. Watch: DebitMyData Custom Logo and Facial Recognition .\nCreator Economy Readiness:Training and compensation models that align with the future AI-driven labor ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nCollective Grid Participation: Future integration into the Human Energy Grid, where digital identity links directly to energy, compute, and compensation systems.\nThis workforce mobilization positions DebitMyData as not just a technology platform, but a human readiness layer—the connective tissue between displaced labor and infrastructure modernization.\n\nPhase Two: Partnering for Ethical Infrastructure\nAs DebitMyData expands the DID and labor participation network, the company is laying the groundwork for the Human Energy Grid, a compliance-ready trust layer for data centers and AI infrastructure providers.\nFor technology giants and developers facing mounting public resistance, Human Energy Grid provides the missing compliance bridge:\nCommunity Consent Intelligence: Blockchain-backed verification that satisfies local governance and environmental mandates.\nPublic Benefit Integration: Energy, water, and data transparency mechanisms that turn traditional opposition into shared prosperity.\nRapid Onboarding:\nDebitMyData’s API and DID infrastructure retrofit easily with existing energy, cloud, and AI systems—no rip-and-replace required.\n\nWe’re creating the social infrastructure that lets hyperscalers build compliantly, governments verify trust transparently, and citizens profit directly from the AI age,” said Founder Preska Thomas.

      "Content": "Have $2,000? 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for at Least a Decade.\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:50 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nSOUN\n\nAMPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's growing AI ecosystem creates compelling growth tailwinds for this quality business.\nSoundHound's voice and conversational AI solutions have caught the attention of major clients.\nAmplitude's AI agents and other tools are building a high-revenue-growth business.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) revolution contains a wealth of investment opportunities, not to mention the potential for massive economic transformation and productivity enhancements. Companies ranging from small start-ups to the world's largest corporate giants are investing heavily in AI research and infrastructure in a bid to keep up in the global technology race.\nThis strong institutional support is expected to accelerate development and adoption and create a favorable and stable environment for AI-focused businesses over the long run. While not all AI stocks will be winners, focusing on quality companies with robust competitive advantages and strong financial foundations can allow you to capitalize on the future of this industry in its still relatively nascent stages.\nOn that note, if you have $2,000 to invest, here are three AI stocks to buy and hold for at least a decade.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) full-stack AI ecosystem, vast data moat, dominant market positions in search and cloud, and substantial financial strength continue to pose enviable tailwinds for this behemoth business. Alphabet boasts end-to-end AI infrastructure, including its in-house AI chips (Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs), the Gemini foundational models, the Google Cloud platform, and a massive array of user-facing products, including Search, YouTube, and Android.\n\nTPUs are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed specifically for neural network math, which makes them efficient for AI training and inference, unlike more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Not only are TPUs the backbone of Google's AI, running core products like Google Search and training massive models like Gemini, but they also provide notable cost savings and boost internal performance.\nBy developing its own silicon, Alphabet is able to decouple from external chip supply chains and pricing to achieve greater control and scale for AI development. Google Cloud now offers TPUs as a service, which also positions Alphabet as a major force in the lucrative AI hardware market beyond just being a consumer of chips.\n\nUser interaction data from Search and YouTube is used to train and refine AI models, providing another durable competitive advantage for the broader business ecosystem. Importantly, AI is boosting Google Search traffic and optimizing ad placements. Search is the company's core cash engine and still represents more than half of the company's overall revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle is the default search engine on most devices, which gives Alphabet a vast distribution network to deploy and refine new AI features. Other ventures, like Waymo (autonomous driving) and AI-powered healthcare research through its subsidiary Verily, are more nascent sources of long-term growth potential and demonstrate Alphabet's commitment to AI innovation.\n\nAlphabet remains consistently profitable (net income increased 33% in the third quarter alone) and generates significant cash flow, which it habitually invests in AI infrastructure, data centers, and research. The company remains a compelling and stalwart play in the AI space that long-term investors can buy, hold, and add to for years to come.\n2. SoundHound SoundHound (NASDAQ: SOUN) specializes in developing and providing independent voice and conversational artificial intelligence solutions for businesses across various industries. This enables companies to integrate customized, natural-sounding voice assistants into their products, services, and apps. Instead of a two-step process of transcribing speech to text and then processing it, SoundHound's technology understands both speech and intent in one step, allowing for faster and more accurate responses.\n\nThese solutions are used in multiple sectors. SoundHound has moved beyond its initial focus on the automotive sector (e.g., its partnership with Stellantis ) into areas such as restaurants (e.g., Chipotle Mexican Grill , Five Guys, White Castle, Jersey Mike's) to reduce its dependency on any single customer. For example, restaurants utilize SoundHound's platform to automate phone and drive-thru orders, manage complex menu modifications, and address customer inquiries about business hours.\nSoundHound also provides AI agents for customer service in various industries, including healthcare, financial services, and insurance. The company generates revenue through subscription fees for its software solutions, commissions from voice-enabled commerce interactions, and by licensing its technology to partners.\n\nSoundHound's Q3 2025 revenue of $42 million represented a 68% increase from a year ago. However, SoundHound has never posted an annual profit, continues to report substantial GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net losses, and its core operations are still bleeding cash. That's why the stock has been hit so hard of late.\nStill, SoundHound's collaborations with major brands and the acquisition of companies like Amelia (an enterprise agentic AI platform) and Interactions (a customer service AI platform) have strengthened its market position, expanded its customer base, and added new capabilities that could prove to be generous growth tailwinds. SoundHound reported a significant contractual backlog of approximately $1.2 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAnd unlike big tech competitors ( Amazon , Google, and Apple ) whose voice AI solutions are tied to their ecosystems, SoundHound offers white-label, customizable solutions that allow businesses to maintain full brand control and data privacy and provide a key selling point for these enterprises. If you believe in that value proposition and have the risk tolerance to invest in a more pure-play, AI-driven business, SoundHound could be worth considering for at least a small position over the next decade.\n3. Amplitude Amplitude (NASDAQ: AMPL) is a digital analytics platform that helps businesses understand how customers use their digital products to improve user experiences and drive revenue growth. The company has fully embraced AI by launching a suite of AI agents and features that automate data analysis and generate actionable insights for customers.\n\nAmplitude's AI agents are autonomous AI tools that monitor user behavior, detect issues (like falling conversion rates), form hypotheses, and suggest or even implement optimizations for things like checkout flow or feature adoption. Its AI feedback solution is an AI-native tool that synthesizes customer feedback from various sources (e.g., calls, reviews, tickets) to instantly develop themes, connect them to user behavior, and help companies build better features.\nAfter some post-pandemic headwinds, Amplitude's growth has started to accelerate again, with recent quarters showing solid increases in revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR). Amplitude reported excellent Q3 2025 results, with ARR of $347 million, up 16% year over year, and remaining performance obligations (RPO) of $391.9 million, up 37% year over year.\n\nAmplitude's business model is a freemium tiered software-as-a-service framework centered on product analytics. It employs a land-and-expand strategy, where it acquires customers through a robust free tier and scales revenue as they grow and adopt more advanced platform capabilities. Companies across various industries, including prominent names such as Walmart , Atlassian , and Shopify, as well as growth-stage disruptors like DoorDash and Coinbase , utilize Amplitude to gain insights into their users' behavior and enhance their digital products.\nThe company has a diverse base of over 4,500 customers and a growing number of large enterprise customers. Its cohort of customers with $100,000 or more in ARR rose 15% year over year in Q3. Overall revenue grew 18% year over year in Q3 2025.\n\nWhile still posting a GAAP net loss, Amplitude is cash-flow positive and expects to achieve non-GAAP operating income for the full year 2025. It generated free cash flow of $3.4 million in Q3. If the company's AI platform continues to gain headway, this business could have a significant role to play in the evolving AI revolution. That's a value proposition that some long-term investors might want to capitalize on.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nMSFT\n\nTSM\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is a leader in e-commerce and fintech.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are making waves with their respective AI innovations.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the top chip manufacturer in the world.\n10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre ›\nInvesting for the long term requires a disciplined and resilient mindset to navigate the inherent volatility of the stock market. Managing the psychology behind your investment decisions is as crucial as selecting the right investments.\n\nThe market price of a stock is often driven by short-term emotions and news, while its true value is tied to the underlying company's long-term earning power and assets. A strong mindset allows you to view temporary price drops as potential buying opportunities for quality assets, not reasons to panic.\nLikewise, if you're focused on the long-term picture, you can select quality businesses with robust fundamentals that make sense as part of your portfolio without being swayed by short-term market volatility. If you have cash to invest in the stock market right now, here are four stocks to consider buying and holding for at least five years.\n1. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the clear e-commerce leader across over a dozen countries in Latin America, including major markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. It has a significant competitive advantage over global players like Amazon due to its established presence, brand recognition, and deep understanding of local market needs.\n\nThe company operates a vast tech ecosystem, including its e-commerce marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, which is powered by its integrated fintech arm Mercado Pago, its robust logistics business Mercado Envíos, and advertising services. It's worth noting that Mercado Pago has grown into a full digital financial services platform (e.g., payments, credit, savings, investments) that serves the region's large unbanked population and has created a sticky user base with high monetization potential.\nThe company is consistently profitable and boasts impressive growth metrics. In Q3 2025, it reported a 39% year-over-year revenue increase. Total net revenue reached $7.4 billion. Total payment volume reached $71 billion, up 41% year over year, and gross merchandise volume rose to $16.5 billion, a 28% year-over-year spike.\n\nRobust e-commerce performance in core markets like Brazil and Mexico bolstered MercadoLibre's quarterly performance. And, the number of successful items sold grew by 39% year over year to 635 million. If you want to invest in an e-commerce and fintech giant operating outside the U.S., MercadoLibre is a profitable and compelling leader to consider.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) managed to effectively monetize generative AI faster than most peers by integrating it across its entire tech stack. AI services accounted for roughly 15 percentage points of the total Azure revenue growth in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026. Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, which has created a high-margin recurring revenue stream.\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI capacity, and its capital expenditures have exceeded $30 billion per quarter to meet surging demand. Azure remains a primary catalyst for the business's long-term value and consistently delivers high growth even on a massive revenue base. For the full fiscal year 2025, Microsoft's annual revenue surpassed $281 billion, growing by 15% from the prior year. Azure revenue was more than $75 billion, a 34% increase year over year. Azure holds approximately 20% of the global cloud market.\nMicrosoft maintains one of the strongest balance sheets in the corporate world, which supports its consistent returns to investors. It's one of only two U.S. companies with a perfect AAA credit rating (that's higher than the U.S. government). The company generated over $100 billion in net income in fiscal 2025, so it continues to have massive flexibility for R&D and acquisitions.\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years and regularly repurchases billions in stock (it returned almost $11 billion to shareholders in the most recent quarter alone through dividends and share repurchases). Management and analysts have set ambitious targets for the next five years. CEO Satya Nadella aims to exceed $500 billion in annual revenue by 2030, nearly double its current scale.\n3. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is deeply integrating powerful AI models like Gemini across its massive ecosystem (e.g, Search, YouTube, Cloud). AI improves its search relevance, makes YouTube more engaging, and personalizes user experiences, which in turn can drive better engagement and more ad dollars. Instead of cannibalizing search, Alphabet's new tools like AI summaries are increasing ad impressions and conversions, and expanding its commercial pathways in search.\n\nAlphabet is also leveraging its custom TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) semiconductor chips to compete in cloud infrastructure. While historically the company had reserved most TPUs for in-house use and cloud services, it has recently begun selling some directly to third parties in specific bilateral deals. These include major AI clients like Anthropic as Alphabet creates a new high-margin revenue stream.\nAlphabet's TPUs are revolutionary, particularly because they are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) purpose-built for the core mathematical operations of deep learning applications. This specialized design provides significant advantages in performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness at scale compared to the more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Revenue from TPUs is a key driver of the overall Google Cloud segment's growth, which generated robust Q3 2025 revenue of $15.2 billion, a 34% year-over-year increase.\n\nAnalysts from firms like Morgan Stanley project that expanded external sales could add billions in new revenue to Alphabet's top line in the coming years (an estimated $13 billion for every 500,000 units sold by 2027). AI could also unlock opportunities in robotics (Waymo), healthcare, and enterprise solutions outside of Alphabet's traditional advertising and cloud businesses. Alphabet's strong balance sheet with substantial cash and low debt, and a generous history of providing enviable returns to shareholders, are icing on the cake for long-term investors in this storied business.\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) or TSMC is the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing and controls roughly 70% of the global foundry market. Unlike investing in a single chip designer, holding TSMC can allow investors to profit regardless of who wins the AI race. And the reality is that there will likely be many winners as the AI revolution heats up.\n\nThe demand for AI computing power is soaring, and only a few companies possess the capabilities to design the required chips. All major AI players -- including Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom -- rely on TSMC to build their most advanced chips. The company produces at least 90% of the world's most advanced chips, which has created a massive technological moat that competitors like Intel and Samsung are currently struggling to bridge.\nManagement expects AI-related revenue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. TSMC had a very strong Q3 2025 financially and beat expectations with both record profits and revenue. Substantial and growing demand for AI chips and high-performance computing (HPC) drove revenue up over 30% year over year. Net income surged 40% year over year, and TSMC's gross margin improved to 59.5%.\n\nTSMC is aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of Taiwan. The company has committed $165 billion to build six advanced fabs in Arizona, with the first already being in volume production. Additional major investments are underway in Japan and Germany, and management aims to have 30% of its most advanced capacity located outside Taiwan by 2028. Shares are up about 40% year to date, and it may be wise to scoop some up before the business soars higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?

However, it has since fallen almost 10% from those highs and currently sports a $4.4 trillion value. What's next for the artificial intelligence (AI) giant?\nCompetition and new products One way Nvidia has stayed on top of the AI mountain is by constantly upping its game and releasing new, groundbreaking products. It's best known for its expensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), but it's increasingly focused on vertically integrated products that draw high-paying clients into its ecosystem.\n\nThese companies are spending vast amounts of money on their AI development using Nvidia products, creating high barriers to entry for other vendors. That gives Nvidia an edge on top of the one it already has from having the most powerful program.\nHowever, there are other top companies, including Amazon and Alphabet , that are creating their own AI chips and finding the white space to drive AI.\nWhat seems likely is that Nvidia will keep launching new and improved technology and keep its lead, but as competition heats up, the landscape continues to change, and the company gets bigger, growth will decelerate. The price is already coming down to a more realistic valuation , and it could still beat the market next year, but it isn't likely to deliver the life-changing gains it has in the past.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Representatives for Thiel and Page did not respond to the Times .\nTech investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned on the risk of a wealth tax in California, saying it will eventually bankrupt the state.\n&#8220;The inevitable outcome will be an exodus of the state’s most talented entrepreneurs who can and will choose to build their companies in less regressive states,&#8221; he posted on X on Monday. &#8220;All that will be left behind is the middle class. The tax burden, then, will fall to the middle class because after the &#8216;richest&#8217; choose to leave, the middle class are both (a) the only ones left and (b) are the largest source of state income to extract taxes from.&#8221;\n\nOn Friday, he posted in a reply to Sen. Ted Cruz , who urged him to move to Texas, that it&#8217;s &#8220;under serious consideration.&#8221;\nBackers of the potential wealth tax must still gather enough signatures before it can qualify for the ballot in November 2026.\nThe proposal calls for California residents worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax equivalent to 5% of their assets. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Page is worth $270 billion and Thiel is worth $27.2 billion.\nThe healthcare union pushing the measure, the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, estimated the wealth tax could raise $100 billion in revenue and offset federal cuts.\nBut California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is also considered a top presidential hopeful, has come out against it.\n\nCompanies have already been leaving California for places with lower taxes and less red tape. Elon Musk moved Tesla and SpaceX to Texas.\nAnd while leading AI companies are based in California, new data centers and AI infrastructure are being built outside the state, where land, water and electricity are more available.\nNew Yorkers aired similar worries about an exodus after democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected the city&#8217;s mayor last month. But so far, that has yet to materialized as luxury home sales in Manhattan surged in November.\n\nStory Continues\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents part of Silicon Valley, said tax dollars helped build the AI industry and dismissed the idea that tech entrepreneurs wouldn&#8217;t start companies in the state due to a 1% tax, adding that innovators are drawn to the area&#8217;s talent.\n&#8220;We cannot have a nation with extreme concentration of wealth in a few places but where 70 percent of Americans believe the American dream is dead and healthcare, childcare, housing, education is unaffordable,&#8221; he said on X . &#8220;What will stifle American innovation, what will make us fall behind China, is if we see further political dysfunction and social unrest, if we fail to cultivate the talent in every American and in every city and town.&#8221;\nStill, he acknowledged lack of accountability and fraud concerns over state tax dollars, saying Sacramento needs anti-corruption measures.\nBlake Scholl, founder and CEO Boom Supersonic, pointed to the billions spent by California for a high-speed rail project that&#8217;s over-budget and behind schedule.\n&#8220;This is morally wrong and ends poorly for everyone,&#8221; he said about the wealth tax in response to Khanna on X.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The South African rand is up more than 11% against the dollar, on track for its best year since 2009.\nPeru followed a similar script. Six mining companies rank among the top 10 holdings in EPU.

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 10:50 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nLLY\n\nABBV\n\nKey Points Amazon and Alphabet are key leaders in the AI race on top of their flagship businesses.\nWalmart benefits from consistent non-discretionary spending like groceries.\nEli Lilly and AbbVie are major pharmaceutical players that have impressive portfolios.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAttempting to time the market by identifying the exact bottom of a dip is very difficult, even for experienced investors. What appears to be a dip can turn into a prolonged decline or a falling knife, and you could just as easily miss out on the best market days to invest as you could the worst.\n\nInstead, by focusing your attention on making quality investments and additions to your portfolio in all market environments, you can withstand the highs and lows of market whims while enriching your portfolio over time.\nIf you have $50,000 to invest right now, you could choose to diversify that capital across a handful of different businesses. Here are five names that you might want to include on that list.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for its leading cloud infrastructure business and flagship e-commerce platform, but also boasts an ever-expanding presence across various sectors, including digital entertainment, groceries, advertising, and autonomous vehicles. Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) isn't just the most profitable segment for the company -- it's also the dominant player in the competitive cloud computing market and controls about 30% of this lucrative space.\n\nThe company remains the leading online retailer in the United States, with a market share of around 40%. Amazon is heavily investing in AI across its operations, from logistics optimization to developing custom AI chips like Trainium and Inferentia to offer clients a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs . These innovations are designed to improve efficiency and attract new customers to AWS.\nOpenAI has signed a landmark, multi-year deal to use AWS's infrastructure for running its AI workloads, including the training of future models. Until recently, Microsoft was OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider. The deal is a significant win for Amazon, as it reassures investors that AWS can compete effectively with other dominant players in providing AI infrastructure.\n\nThe deal involves a massive commitment of computing resources, and Amazon plans to build dedicated data center capacity for OpenAI. It's also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion or more in OpenAI. The investment would likely involve OpenAI using Amazon's custom-designed AI chips for some workloads to compete with Nvidia's dominant chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon remains extremely financially sound thanks to its strong balance sheet, consistent profitability, and expanding margins. Despite its status as a growth stock, the stock looks reasonably valued at approximately 27 times forward earnings.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has integrated AI seamlessly into its core products and created new tailwinds of growth for the business that long-term investors can capitalize on. The Gemini app alone has over 650 million monthly active users. There have been rumors that the company plans to monetize this user base through various forms of advertising, an area where Alphabet has long remained an indomitable leader.\n\nHowever, Google's Vice President of Global Ads, Daniel Taylor, and the official Google Ad Liaison account have publicly stated otherwise, so that remains unlikely, at least for now. The company is still actively monetizing AI in other areas, including AI Overviews in Google Search, and testing ads in AI Mode within Search. Meanwhile, the core Google Search business, along with YouTube, continues to drive profitable growth for the Alphabet ecosystem.\nGoogle Search & Other revenue reached $56.57 billion in Q3, a 15% year-over-year increase. YouTube advertising revenue surpassed the $10 billion mark for the first time in the third quarter (a 15% increase year over year). The Google Services segment, which includes Search and YouTube, also reported operating income of $33.53 billion (up about 9% from a year ago), despite absorbing a $3.5 billion European Commission fine during the quarter. And, consolidated revenue for Alphabet rose 16% to $102.35 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3 2025, and this segment's operating income increased by an eye-popping 85% in the same quarter. Alphabet's backlog of future cloud deals increased 79% in Q3. Alphabet also has potential future growth engines beyond its core businesses, including Waymo and advancements in quantum computing.\nDespite the stock's strong performance in 2025 (up over 60%), it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 30. Alphabet also retains approximately $98.5 billion in cash against $22 billion in long-term debt. This stock continues to look like a no-brainer buy.\n3. Walmart Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) is the world's largest retailer by sales. Its massive scale allows it to offer lower prices and negotiate better terms with suppliers, a significant advantage that helps it attract cost-conscious shoppers, including in inflationary periods.\nWalmart has effectively integrated its vast network of thousands of stores into its e-commerce operations and uses them as fulfillment hubs to offer fast delivery and easy in-store pickup options. This strategy has driven robust e-commerce growth (e-commerce sales were up 27% globally in Q3 FY26).\n\nThe company continues to expand into higher-margin areas like advertising and its membership program, which are contributing a meaningful share of operating income and bolstering overall profitability. Walmart also continues to invest in technology, automation, and AI-driven systems to improve its supply chain efficiency, inventory management, and customer experience, which could position it for long-term success against major retail competitors.\nIn Walmart's Q3, the company generated total revenue of $179.5 billion, up about 6% year over year. Its global advertising business clocked growth of 53%, bolstered by the integration of VIZIO and strong performance from Walmart Connect, while membership income increased 16.7% thanks to double-digit growth in Walmart+ and Sam's Club China memberships.\n\nHouseholds earning more than $100,000 accounted for 75% of Walmart's market share gains during the quarter. Approximately 35% of store-fulfilled orders in the U.S. were delivered in under three hours, with expedited delivery sales growing nearly 70%.\nWalmart is also a Dividend King, having raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years. This history of reliable payouts could appeal to income-focused, long-term investors and underscores its cash flow durability. Its current yield is in the ballpark of 0.8%, a bit below the average S&P 500 stock. While Walmart's trading higher than historical averages (about 38 times forward earnings), this stalwart consumer staples stock could be a smart addition to a long-term investor's portfolio.\n\n4. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) leads the market for GLP-1 medications and has officially surpassed its rival Novo Nordisk . The market for these drugs is projected to reach over $100 billion by 2030, so there's a considerable long-term growth opportunity for the company to continue to capitalize on.\nIts dual-acting drugs, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss), have shown superior efficacy compared to competitors in clinical trials, which has fueled a significant increase in Eli Lilly's market share.\n\nThe company has promising late-stage candidates, including the once-daily oral weight-loss pill orforglipron and the triple-agonist injectable retatrutide, which could further expand its market reach and offer more treatment options to patients. Eli Lilly has filed for FDA approval for orforglipron. It's a small molecule, easier to manufacture than peptides, and shows promise for diabetes as well as cardiovascular risk factors.\nRetatrutide replicates the effects of three different natural hormones: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon. By combining the effects of all three hormones, retatrutide is designed to be a highly effective treatment for conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could serve as a future pillar of Eli Lilly's portfolio.\n\nEli Lilly has consistently beaten analyst expectations, with its third-quarter 2025 revenue soaring 54% year over year to $17.6 billion. The company has invested billions in expanding its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and internationally to meet the explosive demand for its drugs.\nDespite the stock's high P/E ratio of around 34 on a forward basis, the company's strong growth prospects and dominant position in a revolutionary therapeutic area could warrant a long-term investment in this powerhouse healthcare stock. The company has also paid a dividend in some form since the 1800s, and regularly increases its payout. It's increased its dividend by a notable 15% for seven years in a row and counting.\n5. AbbVie AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) is benefiting from the burgeoning sales of its flagship immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which delivered combined revenues of about $7 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. These drugs are more than making up for the decline in sales of Humira, which was once the top-selling drug in the world, and have patent protection into the 2030s.\n\nThe drugmaker's overall net revenue for the three-month period totaled just shy of $16 billion, up 9% year over year. AbbVie has around 90 programs in its R&D pipeline across various therapeutic areas. Recent acquisitions have added promising new candidates to the mix.\nThese include candidates like Bretisilocin (from Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals) and ISB 2001 (from Ichnos Glenmark Innovation), and signal AbbVie's push into novel neuroscience and oncology, including psychedelic-inspired therapies and advnced antibody-based cancer drugs. Bretisilocin is a serotonin receptor agonist designed for major depressive disorder (MDD), while ISB 2001 is a T-cell engager for multiple myeloma.\nThe company has increased its dividend for 54 consecutive years (including its time as part of Abbott Laboratories ), which makes it another Dividend King on today's list. The current forward dividend yield is an attractive 3.05%.\n\nAbbVie stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 16. If you're looking for a quality healthcare stock to buy and hold for the long run, definitely don't overlook AbbVie the next time you go stock shopping.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Market analysts are calling this a definitive “takeover arc,” suggesting that the initial hype wave is settling into a phase where Google's infrastructure is winning out.\n“That is not noise,” noted Solid Finance CEO Sam Badawi . “If you believe web behavior reflects user preference at scale, then this is the clearest signal that [Google] is not only in the game, it is winning share.”\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nCapturing The ‘Flow’ The driver behind this shift appears to be Google's mastery of “native distribution.” Unlike standalone competitors, Gemini is increasingly embedded where users already live: inside Chrome, Android, Workspace, and Search.\nAccording to strategist Shay Boloor , this integration is the key differentiator. As AI usage transitions from novelty to routine utility, products with native distribution naturally “capture the flow.”\nBy surfacing AI answers directly within existing workflows, Google is removing the friction of switching apps, effectively siphoning users who might otherwise navigate to ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Copilot, despite being baked into Windows and Edge, has barely moved the needle, stagnating from 1.5% to 1.2% share over the same period.\nThe contrast suggests that while distribution is powerful, product trust is paramount. While Copilot has flatlined, Gemini is successfully converting its vast reach into recurring user habits, proving that Google is earning user trust in a way its big-tech rival has yet to replicate.\n\nGOOG Outperforms In 2025 Shares of Alphabet’s Class C have risen by 65.59% year-to-date and 60.16% over the year, whereas the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced by 22.31% and 17.86%, respectively.\nIn the near term, GOOG has gained 80.97% over the last six months, but fell 1.44% over the last month. On Wednesday, the shares closed largely unchanged, 0.0032% lower at $315.67 apiece.\n\nIt maintains a stronger price trend over the short, medium, and long terms, with a poor value ranking.

      "Content": "Here Are My Top 3 Growth Stocks to Buy Now\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nLLY\n\nMELI\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is the e-commerce and fintech leader in Latin America.\nEli Lilly is already looking ahead to its next generation of successes both in and outside of the GLP-1 industry.\nAlphabet's AI infrastructure is driving gains for its own business and external customers.\n10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre ›\n\nGrowth stocks are a great option for long-term investors due to their potential for high capital appreciation. These companies typically operate in innovative and dynamic industries and reinvest their earnings back into the business to fuel further expansion. This can lead to significant stock price increases through the years that can enrich your portfolio through the beauty of compounding returns.\nIf you're looking for top growth stocks to buy right now, here are three no-brainer names to consider.\n1. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is quickly becoming the digital backbone of Latin America, as its integrated e-commerce , logistics, and fintech ecosystem continues to thrive. By handling 95% of its own deliveries through its Mercado Envíos network, MercadoLibre achieves faster and more reliable shipping than its competitors, which remains a critical advantage amid the region's often-challenging infrastructure.\n\nThe company's Mercado Pago division provides essential financial services in an underbanked region. Its total credit portfolio has reached $11 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2025, up 83% from a year ago, and a large portion of its payment volume is coming from outside the e-commerce platform.\nMercadoLibre has been cash-flow positive every year since 2007 and has demonstrated an ability to fund its own expansion without excessive reliance on external capital. Newer ventures like digital advertising are high-margin businesses that can leverage the company's vast user data to drive growth and improve overall profitability in the years ahead.\nIn Q3 2025, MercadoLibre's net revenue popped 39% year over year to $7.4 billion, the 27th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth greater than 30%. Brazil is immensely important to MercadoLibre as the company's single largest and most crucial market, which accounts for over half of its total revenues. Management has emphasized a focus on long-term value creation over short-term margin improvements, making significant investments in logistics and expanding free shipping in Brazil.\n\nThe lowered free shipping threshold in Brazil led to a surge in items sold in Q3 (up 42% year over year in Brazil) and the largest quarterly addition of unique buyers in the company's history. Unique buyers in Brazil were up 29% year over year in Q3. MercadoLibre delivered about $718 million in adjusted free cash flow in the first nine months of 2025 alone. If you want to invest in a top-notch e-commerce and fintech stock, MercadoLibre looks like a no-brainer buy.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) briefly reached a $1 trillion market cap earlier this year, becoming the first healthcare company to achieve that milestone thanks to the explosive growth and global adoption of its obesity and diabetes treatments. In Q3 2025, Lilly reported 54% year-over-year revenue growth to $17.6 billion. Combined sales of its GLP-1 products Mounjaro (diabetes) and Zepbound (obesity) totaled over $10 billion in a single quarter and now account for more than 50% of the company's total revenue.\n\nLilly has unseated its rival Novo Nordisk as the market leader in the GLP-1 space and now controls nearly 60% of total U.S. prescriptions for these medications. The company recently submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA for its once-daily GLP-1 pill, forglipron, for the treatment of obesity in adults, following positive results from its Phase 3 trial. In this trial, orforglipron significantly outperformed the placebo in maintaining weight loss over 52 weeks in patients previously on semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) or tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound).\nThis trial specifically tested weight maintenance after initial intensive treatment to demonstrate orforglipron's role in preventing weight regain. Patients switching from Wegovy regained approximately 2 pounds, and those switching from Zepbound regained approximately 11 pounds compared to the placebo. The pill was awarded a Commissioner's National Priority Voucher.\n\nWhile standard reviews typically take around 10 months, this voucher could result in an FDA decision as early as the first quarter of 2026. Lilly's CEO previously estimated a target approval date around March 2026. A separate application for orforglipron to treat Type 2 diabetes is expected to follow in the new year too. If approved, orforglipron will be the first small-molecule, once-daily oral GLP-1 receptor agonist available for weight management. Analysts expect it to generate up to $40 billion in annual revenue at its peak.\nAnother key GLP-1 drug candidate is Eli Lilly's retatrutide, a first-in-class triple hormone receptor agonist, which means it mimics the effects of three naturally occurring hunger-regulating hormones simultaneously. The drug is currently in Phase 3 trials and has shown unprecedented weight loss results (averaging 28.2%) in clinical data released in late 2025. Beyond weight loss, Lilly is seeing strong demand for Kisunla, its Alzheimer's treatment, which is expected to launch in multiple European markets in 2026. This appears to be a fantastic healthcare stock to buy and hold for the long term. It also happens to be a long-standing dividend payer, with a yield just under 1% partly due to the stock's generous run-up of 40% over the last year.\n\n3. Alphabet In Q3 2025, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) reported its first-ever $100 billion quarter. Its total revenue reached $102.3 billion (up 16% from a year ago), and diluted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 35.4% to $2.87. The company maintains one of the world's strongest balance sheets , with $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities as of the last count. Google Cloud revenue increased 34% year over year to $15.2 billion in Q3 2025. Operating margins for this segment also expanded significantly to 23.7%, up from 17.1% a year earlier.\n\nThe company has a massive $155 billion backlog of non-recognized sales contracts, which reflects the impressive future demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered infrastructure. Alphabet's primary AI model, Gemini, now has over 650 million monthly active users and is driving a 3x increase in search queries through AI Overviews. Moreover, Alphabet's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are seeing high demand from external companies, which could potentially create a multibillion-dollar revenue stream.\nDespite fears of AI disruption, Google Search revenue grew 14.5% year over year in Q3 to $56.6 billion as the company maintains its roughly 90% global share of the search engine market. Advertising revenue on YouTube grew 15% to $10.3 billion, bolstered by the monetization of Shorts, and paid subscriptions (YouTube Premium, Google One) crossed 300 million, underscoring the ability of this segment to provide a stable, high-margin recurring revenue stream.\n\nAlphabet has been one of the best-performing stocks in the Magnificent Seven for 2025, with shares rising roughly 60% year to date. Despite the rally, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) around 28, which is quite reasonable given its more than 30% earnings growth rate. Investors should also pay attention to Alphabet's Waymo. The autonomous driving subsidiary is emerging as a leader in the U.S. robotaxi market, with fully autonomous, publicly available services currently operating in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Austin, Texas.\nWaymo is rapidly expanding, processing over 450,000 paid rides per week, and is reportedly in talks to raise over $15 billion at a valuation approaching $100 billion. Alphabet remains a top tech stock that looks like a great buy now and for the long term if you're a growth-oriented investor seeking a profitable, powerhouse business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?

      "Content": "Is Nebius Stock Set to Double in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nebius recently signed a contract with a key hyperscaler.\nManagement dramatically expanded its projections for 2026.\nThe stock is very expensive.\n10 stocks we like better than Nebius Group ›\nNebius Group (NASDAQ: NBIS) stock has been on an absolute tear in 2025. The stock's price has more than tripled, up around 225%, while also being down 33% from all-time highs established in October. Given that volatility, investors are likely wondering where Nebius' stock will go heading into 2026.\nWhile it will be difficult to post 200%-plus annual gains, Nebius may be in line to double in value, especially with all the massive artificial intelligence (AI) spending planned for 2026.\nNebius believes that 2026 will be even better than 2025 Nebius was formerly a part of Yandex, essentially the Russian equivalent of Google. Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war and all the sanctions that fell on Russia, Yandex decided to split its company into Russian and non-Russian assets, and Nebius was spun out. Nebius, now headquartered in Amsterdam, is a technology company that has pivoted its operations and now provides AI infrastructure.\n\nNebius is another way to invest in the thriving artificial intelligence boom, as it offers full-stack capabilities with best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) at the data centers it owns or leases. Nebius' biggest clients include Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and it has signed large, multi-year contracts with both of them.\nThe demand for AI computing power in data centers isn't expected to slow down, and Nebius has modified its initial 2026 plans as a result. Previously, it expected to contract 1 gigawatt of computing power for 2026. Now, it's upped that guidance to more than 2.5 gigawatts. It's increasing its power needs because it has sold out all available computing capacity for the third quarter.\n\nIt's sold out of capacity, resulting in unbelievable revenue growth of 355% year over year to $146 million in Q3. However, that's a drop in the bucket compared to where Nebius will be next year.\nFor the full year, it's expecting $500 million to $550 million in revenue. Because it's growing so fast, that number is much smaller than the $900 million to $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) it expects to achieve. For most companies, ARR would be how much revenue they would generate each year if they ceased all growth opportunities. So, seeing this figure so much higher than actual revenue showcases Nebius' impressive growth. While 2025 has been good, 2026 will be even better.\n\nStory Continues\nNebius management believes the company can achieve a $7 billion to $9 billion ARR at the end of 2026. At a minimum, that's seven times Nebius' current ARR. Growth like that gets investors excited, and it could easily translate into a stock that can double, as long as you don't have to overpay for the stock now.\n\nNebius is unprofitable, and its stock is expensive Valuing Nebius stock isn't easy. Profits aren't even close to becoming a reality, so valuing the company based on forward earnings isn't possible. Although it brought in $146 million in revenue during Q3, its net income loss totaled $120 million. Nebius is funding its growth at the cost of profitability, which may turn some investors away. Nebius will likely continue to stay unprofitable as it expands its operations to account for the massive surge in computing demand.\n\nFrom a price-to-sales (PS) standpoint, Nebius stock is very expensive at nearly 60 times sales. That's expensive for a stock in general, let alone one that's as unprofitable as Nebius is. However, its growth is incredible, and if it grows at the pace investors expect, valuation may not be as big a concern.\nThe real factor in Nebius stock performance in 2026 will be the market's appetite for risk. The market is currently somewhat bearish on AI sentiment, even if the spending is happening. The market wants to see real returns from the AI hyperscalers, and it's not seeing that right now. Time will tell what will happen with Nebius stock, but I could easily see the stock doubling in price in 2026 if bullish sentiment returns, or getting cut in half if the market takes a bearish outlook.\n\nAs a result, I'd rather invest in a more surefire pick like Nvidia , which is providing GPUs for companies like Nebius at a high profitability level.\nShould you buy stock in Nebius Group right now? Before you buy stock in Nebius Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nebius Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Analysis-Waymo's San Francisco outage raises doubts over robotaxi readiness during crises\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPCG\n\nTSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A widespread power outage in San Francisco that led to Waymo robotaxis stalling and snarling traffic earlier this month has raised concerns about the readiness of autonomous vehicle operators to tackle major emergencies like earthquakes and floods.\nDriverless taxis from Alphabet unit ​Waymo, a ubiquitous feature on the city's streets, were stuck at intersections with their hazard lights turned on as traffic lights stopped working following a fire ‌at a PG&E substation that knocked out power to roughly one-third of the city on December 20, videos posted on social media showed. Waymo halted operations, resuming a day later.\n\nThe incident has renewed calls for ‌stricter regulation of the nascent but fast-growing industry as other companies including Tesla and Amazon's Zoox race to expand robotaxi services in several cities.\n\"If you get a response to a blackout wrong, regulators are derelict if they do not respond to that by requiring some sort of proof that the earthquake scenario will be handled properly,\" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Waymo said that while its robotaxis are designed to handle non-operational traffic signals as four-way stops, they occasionally request a ⁠confirmation check. Though the vehicles successfully traversed more than 7,000 ‌darkened signals on Saturday, \"the outage created a concentrated spike\" in confirmation requests that \"led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets,\" Waymo said.\n\nRobotaxi operators around the globe use remote access by humans - known in the industry as \"teleoperation\" - in varying degrees to monitor and control ‍vehicles. Waymo, for example, has a team of human \"fleet response\" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver, its bot, when it encounters a particular situation.\nBut such remote assistance has its limitations, and the Waymo outage highlights the need to regulate how robotaxi operators use the technology, said Missy Cummings, director of the George Mason University Autonomy and Robotics Center and former adviser to ​the U.S. road safety regulator.\n\"The whole point of having remote operations is for humans to be there when the system is not responsive in the way it should ‌be,\" she said. \"The federal government needs to regulate remote operations,\" Cummings said. \"They need to make sure that there's backup remote operations when there's some kind of catastrophic failure.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCalifornia's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulate and issue permits for the testing and commercial deployment of robotaxis, have said they are looking into the incident.\nThe DMV said it was talking to Waymo and other autonomous vehicle makers about actions related to emergency response. It also said it was formulating regulations to ensure remote drivers \"meet high standards for safety, accountability and responsiveness.\"\n\n'A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW'\nDeploying and commercializing fully autonomous vehicles have been harder than expected with high investments to ensure the technology is ⁠safe and public outcry after collisions forcing many to shut shop.\nFollowing a high-profile accident in 2023 ​when a robotaxi from General Motors' Cruise dragged a pedestrian, regulators revoked its permit, eventually leading the ​company to cease operations.\nBut robotaxis have returned to the spotlight with Tesla rolling out its service in Austin, Texas earlier this year and CEO Elon Musk promising rapid expansion. Waymo, which has grown slowly and steadily over the years since its launch as Google's self-driving project in ‍2009, has also accelerated expansion.\nWith a fleet of ⁠more than 2,500 vehicles, Waymo operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Metro Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe company said the confirmation processes its vehicles follow were established during early deployment and that it was now refining them to match its current scale. Waymo is implementing fleet-wide updates that provide vehicles with \"specific ⁠power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.\"\nBoth Cummings and Koopman said robotaxi operators should face additional permitting requirements once their fleets grow beyond a certain size to ensure that they have adequate ‌capabilities to deal with large-scale failures.\n\"If this had been an earthquake, it would have been a problem,\" Koopman said. \"This is just a shot across ‌the bow.\"\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Alistair Bell)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But Baird Tech Strategist Ted Mortonson is warning that a \"tremendous amount of volatility\" could be coming to the AI trade next year. He also explains why some portfolio managers may have to sell shares of some tech companies if AI giants like Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) go public in 2026 .\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Ted\nRight now, I think if you look at 26, we're going to have a tremendous amount of volatility. The AI trade is very well understood, at least through my client base with\n00:20 Ted\nthe you look at the infrastructure build really outpacing enterprise uh adoption. And that's the issue. Uh we're going to spend at a 40% clip here for the next couple years. Uh the Sox is up, the semiconductor index is up uh almost 48% year to date. And if you look at the IGV or the software index that's been the big laggard, only up 7.8%. So all I think of this is understood. As we uh as we look into 26, there's there's three issues that I'm uh looking at very, very closely and we can go in that if you'd like to.\n00:54 Speaker B\nYeah, I'd like to go into that. And maybe Ted, on that on that point you just brought up, I just want to drill into that. This this mismatch as you say between the the data center build out and the the real enterprise AI adoption. When would you expect Ted then to see that enterprise AI adoption story play out? Is is is that a 2026 story, Ted? Is it 2027? What do you think?\n01:21 Ted\nRight now, that's a it's hard to nail down, but I don't think it's 26. The enterprise, there's only roughly 30% of the Global 2000 that's ready to move to Gen AI. 70% is still going through data cloud migration and uh data cleansing to get into an LLM. So, we've got, you know, enterprise it always takes so much longer than the street is looking at. That mismatch probably goes into 27, 28 is my guess.\n01:54 Speaker B\nAnd and how what are the signs and signals Ted as investors I would be looking for to say, okay, now we're really saying seeing AI monetization, not just AI marketing. I mean, am I looking at software spend? Am I watching the cloud businesses? Like what should I be looking for, Ted?\n02:22 Ted\nI think I think it's it's well understood that the cloud Titans are going to see it in token growth as well as just their their overall cloud growth. Where I think it's really instrumental to see enterprise adoption is uh via your last few guests, is in the software area. Specifically on the agentic plays, whether it be, you know, a CRM, a ServiceNow, a hubspot, um, you know, and then the whole security sector is moving to AI. I think if you see robust, um, uh net new ARR, that's that's going to be a very good indication of enterprise uh adoption.\n03:22 Speaker B\nYou you another theme Ted, I want your take on which you wrote about was obviously, you know, the massive uh CAPEX by tech giants. But of course we've seen these concerns creeping up at least with some names Ted, financial stress, you know, debt loads, and I'm just curious how you're thinking through that dynamic.\n03:52 Ted\nWell, my clients do not want to play names that are negative free cash flow. Uh this is one of these cycles because of this mismatch in infrastructure, it's very capital intensive on this infrastructure build. So the only real names that really have the the the businesses behind it to really uh fund the capX is Microsoft and Google and that you know, Google's up 87% uh year to date. Um so with with that, um I I think uh there's a propensity to just watch and have some dry powder. Um I don't have a lot of interest in some of the negative free cash flow names at this point. And it's obvious I think as we go forward that you're getting indications that whether it be Anthropic or whether it be Open AI or SpaceX, that the debt market is tapped and the it's not big enough quite frankly to fund the infrastructure build. So all of these next generation companies are going to have to tap the equity market. And my worry there is very simple after doing this for a few decades is when you have four or five major tech companies that have to raise just a boatload of capital. Open AI has been rumored a hundred billion dollars. My worry is that we get some time in the in in 26 where all these guys come public at the same time and we drain quote unquote the equity liquidity lake, if you will. And my PMs are going to be forced to sell some of their winners to to fund some of these uh positions in these new companies.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer talked about.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares have gained 36% year-to-date and have lost 8.9% since October’s end. The firm made quite a splash on December 24th after chip designer Groq announced that it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with it. Under the agreement, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will buy Groq’s assets for a $20 billion price tag to make it its largest acquisition to date. Earlier in December, Bernstein reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares and a $275 share price target. Bernstein pointed out that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still waiting for US approvals to sell its H200 chips to China. Crucially, Bernstein also pointed out that the chip designer believes it enjoys a two-year advantage over Google’s TPU AI chips. These chips have been seen as an alternative to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s pricey AI GPUs. Cramer also believes that the firm’s latest Rubin AI GPUs will make their mark felt:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "3 Genius Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 11:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nKey Points Alphabet is getting closer to useful quantum technology.\nNvidia recently released a product that will enable hybrid quantum computing.\nIonQ's quantum computer is leading the pack for accuracy.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nQuantum computing isn't as popular a theme among investors now as it was just a couple of months ago, which means that this could be a good time to start considering some top-tier stocks in this segment. Stock prices in the industry are driven by hype at this stage, and when the hype cycle is low, it can offer opportunities to buy in.\n\nWith experts not expecting quantum computing systems to deliver broad real-world advantages over classical computers any earlier than 2030, we have a long way to go before we find out which companies will be the winners in this emerging industry. As a result, I think it's better for investors interested in getting exposure to the technology to spread their investments out across multiple companies -- some that have established businesses in other areas and are also involved in quantum computing, as well as some of the riskier quantum computing pure plays.\nI think a diversified trio of stocks like this one would be a great place for investors to start.\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has become one of the biggest companies in the world thanks to the dominance of Google Search. The profits from ad sales connected to that product have allowed Alphabet to fund other endeavors, such as its popular generative AI model and its dominant cloud computing business. Another area that it's diving into is quantum computing, and it seems to be having some success with that technology.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced that its Willow chip had run an algorithm that for the first time demonstrated a verifiable quantum computing advantage. This is a huge deal because it shows that viable quantum computing isn't as far away as some may think. While the forecast arrival of generally useful quantum computing is still no sooner than 2030, in some niche cases, it could prove viable sooner than that.\nAlphabet, of course, isn't an all-or-nothing investment in this new technology. The company is a massive and diversified business that uses excess cash flow from its core operations to fund new research. If it can develop effective quantum computing technologies in-house, those will boost its artificial intelligence efforts and increase its cloud computing client base.\nAlphabet's base businesses are set to thrive in 2026, and with plenty of cash to fund its quantum research, its stock is a top pick in the space.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't making a quantum processing unit to compete with all of the various companies involved in this realm. Instead, it's focusing on maximizing its traditional graphics processing units (GPUs). But it's not ignoring the quantum realm.\nNvidia understands that this new technology will likely be deployed in hybrid systems that use both traditional and quantum computers. This will require an interface between the two, and Nvidia released NVQLink to serve just that purpose.\n\nThis ensures that many cutting-edge quantum computing players will be using its hardware and software to interface with classical hardware, making it a perfect investment to bridge the gap between the old and the new technologies.\nWith demand for its AI accelerators not expected to slow down, Nvidia should be a great stock to own while we wait for quantum technology to arrive.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is one of the risky upstarts that's betting it all on bringing a practical version of this technology to market. There are several other small quantum computing pure plays, but in my opinion, IonQ is the best bet to provide a useful application.\nAll quantum computers are built around qubits (quantum bits), but there are numerous ways to create them. IonQ is taking a relatively unusual approach -- trapped ion qubits. That technology trades some speed for greater accuracy. Right now, IonQ holds the world record for the quantum computing system with the best two-qubit gate fidelity, which is a measure of how unlikely it is for the system to have a result with an error in it after a computation passes through two quantum operations.\n\nThe company has achieved 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, indicating about one error in every 10,000 operations. That's a huge lead over its rivals, which have yet to breach the 99.9% threshold (one error in every 1,000 operations).\nTime will tell if this head start will be enough for it to establish itself as the top quantum computing provider, but it's a good beginning. IonQ is the leading start-up quantum computing business, so it's my top pick for the high-risk side of this group of investments.\nIf IonQ's approach pans out, it could provide monster returns. If it doesn't, the stock will likely go to $0. However, even if that happens, your investments in Alphabet and Nvidia should be able to pick up the slack, which is why it's smart to balance out risky investments with more conservative ones.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,994 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,156,218 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 986 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Owing to its growing audience, new ad tools, and engaged users, Reddit may grow its advertising revenue at an exorbitant pace.\nNeedham noted that Reddit is the fastest growing company in their coverage.\nReddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT) is a social media platform that leverages AI to strengthen search functionality and improve user engagement.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The fund reported holding 224,842 shares with a market value of approximately $9.46 million at quarter-end, representing approximately 2.84% of its total reportable U.S. equity assets.\n\nWhat Else to Know Top five holdings after the filing:\nNYSEMKT: SPY: $53.02 million (15.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IBIT: $25.17 million (7.6% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: GOOGL: $15.19 million (4.6% of AUM)\nNYSE: CRC: $11.29 million (3.4% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ITRN: $10.02 million (3.0% of AUM)\nAs of Friday, Fluor shares were priced at $40.69, down 20% over the past year and well underperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 15% in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$15.59 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$3.38 billion\nPrice (as of Friday)\n$40.69\nOne-Year Price Change\n(20%)\n\nCompany Snapshot Fluor Corporation provides engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services, project management, fabrication, modularization, and asset integrity solutions across energy, infrastructure, government, and technology markets.\nThe company operates a project-driven business model, generating revenue through large-scale contracts in energy transition, infrastructure, advanced technologies, life sciences, mining, and government services.\nIt serves oil, gas, petrochemical, infrastructure, mining, life sciences, advanced technology firms, and U.S. government agencies as primary customers.\n\nFluor Corporation is a global leader in engineering and construction services, with a diversified portfolio spanning energy, infrastructure, technology, and government projects. The company leverages its scale and technical expertise to deliver complex projects and solutions for both private and public sector clients. Its strategic focus on energy transition and mission-critical government services positions Fluor to capitalize on long-term industry trends and evolving client needs.\nFoolish Take Stepping into Fluor Corporation after a difficult stretch for the civil engineer firm suggests a willingness to look past headline noise and focus on normalized earnings power. Fluor’s third quarter was messy on the surface. Revenue fell 18% year over year and GAAP results were dragged down by legacy project charges and NuScale mark-to-market volatility. But dig deeper and the underlying picture looks steadier. Adjusted EBITDA climbed 29% year over year to $161 million, and management raised full-year adjusted EPS and EBITDA guidance. Just as important, 82% of the $28.2 billion backlog is reimbursable, limiting downside risk from cost overruns and execution surprises.\n\nCapital allocation is also doing some quiet heavy lifting. The company repurchased $70 million of stock in the quarter and is targeting up to $800 million more through early 2026, supported by $2.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Meanwhile, new awards totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter, with nearly all of it reimbursable work. For long-term investors, this looks less like a turnaround gamble and more like a patience play. The risk is real, but so is the margin of safety if execution holds.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary 13F assets under management: The total value of U.S. equity securities reported by an institutional investment manager in SEC Form 13F filings.\nAssets under management (AUM): The total market value of assets a fund or investment firm manages on behalf of clients.\nPosition: The amount of a particular security or investment held by an investor or fund.\nStake: The ownership interest or share an investor holds in a company or asset.\nTop five holdings: The five largest investments in a fund's portfolio, ranked by market value.\nFiling: An official document submitted to a regulatory agency, often disclosing financial or investment information.\nEngineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services: Comprehensive project services covering design, material sourcing, and building for large-scale infrastructure or industrial projects.\nProject-driven business model: A business approach where revenue is primarily generated from executing individual client projects rather than recurring sales.\nEnergy transition: The shift from traditional fossil fuels to renewable and low-carbon energy sources.\nModularization: The process of constructing sections of a project off-site for later assembly at the final location.\nAsset integrity solutions: Services ensuring that physical assets, such as infrastructure or equipment, remain safe, reliable, and efficient throughout their lifecycle.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Nvidia's Groq deal underscores how the AI chip giant uses its massive balance sheet to 'maintain dominance'\n\nLaura Bratton\nUpdated Fri, December 26, 2025 at 10:33 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nMU\n\nXAAI.PVT\n\nNvidia’s ( NVDA ) licensing deal with chip startup Groq ( GROQ.PVT ) shows how the tech giant is leveraging its massive cash pile to sustain its preeminence in the AI market.\nNvidia this week said it struck a non-exclusive deal with Groq to license its technology and hired the startup’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, its president, and other employees. CNBC reported the agreement to be worth $20 billion , marking Nvidia’s largest-ever deal. (The company declined a request for comment on the figure.)\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients Thursday that the Nvidia-Groq deal “appears strategic in nature for NVDA as they leverage their increasingly powerful balance sheet to maintain dominance in key areas.” Nvidia’s cash inflow climbed more than 30% from the previous year to $22 billion in its most recent quarter.\n\"This transaction is ... essentially an acquisition of Groq without being labeled one (to avoid the regulators' scrutiny),\" added Hedgeye Risk Management analysts in a note Friday.\n\nThe move is just the latest in a string of AI deals by Nvidia, the world’s first $5 trillion company . The chipmaker’s investments in AI firms span the entire market, ranging from large language model developers such as OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and xAI ( XAAI.PVT ) to “neoclouds” like Lambda ( LAMD.PVT ) and CoreWeave ( CRWV ), which specialize in AI services and compete with its Big Tech customers.\n\nNvidia has also invested in chipmakers Intel ( INTC ) and Enfabrica. The company made a failed attempt around 2020 to acquire British chip architecture designer Arm ( ARM ).\nNvidia’s wide-ranging investments — many of them in its own customers — have led to accusations that it’s involved in circular financing schemes reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. The company has vehemently denied those claims.\nGroq, meanwhile, was looking to become one of Nvidia’s rivals.\nFounded in 2016, Groq makes LPUs (language processing units) geared toward AI inferencing and marketed as alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units).\nTraining AI models involves teaching a model to learn patterns from large amounts of data, while \"inferencing\" refers to using that trained model to generate outputs. Both processes demand massive computing power from AI chips.\n\nWhile Nvidia easily dominates the chip market for AI training, some analysts argue that Nvidia could soon see greater competition in the inference space. That’s because custom chips like Google's ( GOOG ) TPUs (tensor processing units) — and arguably Groq’s chips called LPUs (language processing units) — may be better suited for certain tasks. LPUs, for instance, are faster and more energy efficient when used for certain models, utilizing a type of memory technology called SRAM within the chips. On the other hand, Nvidia GPUs rely on off-chip HBM made by companies like Micron ( MU ) and Samsung ( 005930.KS ).\n\nStory Continues\nRoss, the Groq CEO, said in a recent interview that the upstart aimed to provide chips for half the world’s AI inference computing needs — and cheaply.\n“What we want to do is we want to drive the cost of compute as close to zero as we can get it. Every year we want to make it cheaper,” he told Indian business outlet YourStory . Notably, Ross already helped create Nvidia’s greatest source of competition: The executive led the development of Google’s first-generation TPUs.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst CJ Muse said Nvidia’s \"acqui-hire\" of Groq talent and licensing of its intellectual property showed the chipmaker “is playing both offense and defense” in the AI space. Muse said the deal would allow Nvidia to take “even greater share of the inference market.”\nNvidia shares rose more than 1% Friday.\nOthers on Wall Street were more confused by Nvidia’s move and its potential $20 billion price tag. Hedgeye Risk Management analysts argued that Groq's chips are \"still unproven\" when it comes to large AI models, due to their low memory capacity.\n\"Groq's current technology is greatly limited to only a small subset of inference workloads,\" added DA Davidson analyst Alex Platt.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Sign up here.\nHappy Holidays. Eric here.\nPayPal is all in on stablecoins.\nThe $56 billion payment giant’s CEO, Alex Chriss, told Fortune this week that it is integrating blockchain solutions across its verticals.\nWhy? Because the 30-year-old venture must reinvent itself to stay relevant in an ever-changing world.\n\n“If you were to build the payments ecosystem from scratch today, it wouldn’t look like the way it does today,” said Chriss. “You would start to use some sort of blockchain, or some sort of thing that probably looks a lot like stablecoin.”\nPayPal is hardly alone. Wall Street players aplenty are on a campaign to integrate blockchain solutions into their offerings.\nTech titans like Stripe and Google are launching their own blockchains, banks such as Santander and Société Générale are reportedly exploring the creation of their own stablecoins, and crypto firms and institutional players are scooping up blockchain businesses in multi-million-dollar acquisitions.\nAs Mike Giampapa, general partner at Galaxy Ventures, told me, institutions “view these efforts as opportunities for growth and margin expansion, replacing legacy rails with modern blockchain infrastructure without requiring end users to materially change existing behaviour.”\n\nThese efforts are expected to continue next year, too.\nIf 2025 was the year when regulators and lawmakers cleared the path for traditional financial firms to adopt crypto rails, 2026 is set to be the year when they take advantage of that opportunity.\nAnd rest assured that DL News will be there to report on it.\nBrazilian $195,000 music project will let audiences ‘hear’ Bitcoin price changes Brazil’s culture ministry has given its blessing to an art project that aims to turn Bitcoin price volatility into impromptu musical masterpieces, Tim Alper reports.\nHow crypto airdrops will change in 2026 The days of experimenting with new protocols and receiving lumps of valuable tokens are fading away, Tim Craig writes.\nWhy South Korea and Japan are bidding to make 2026 the year of the stablecoin South Korea and Japan are playing catch-up in the stablecoins game in the face of a US-dominated global stablecoin market worth around $255 billion.\nPost of the Week You haven’t missed the State of Defi report, created in collaboration with DL News and our friends over at DefiLlama and DL Research, have you?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Tesla’s (TSLA) stock four years ago, it would be worth about $13,700 today, thanks to a 37% price gain since late December 2021.\nThat’s a solid profit, but it falls well short of the massive returns you’d have gotten with other high-profile stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) or Alphabet (GOOG). The next four years could be a lot more lucrative for Tesla investors — or a lot worse.\n\nWhat could a $10,000 Tesla investment today look like by 2030? Here’s what a couple of experts had to say.\nAlso see the Tesla investing mistake that could cost you thousands .\nThe Bull Case A $10,000 investment in Tesla today could be worth twice that much by 2030 if the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle (EV) maker reaches certain benchmarks, according to Chad Cummings, an attorney and certified public accountant (CPA) at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax.\n\nBut for that to happen, a lot of things would have to go the right way.\n“If Tesla scales its energy storage segment and increases paid software penetration above current rates, [its] position could exceed $20,000,” Cummings told GOBankingRates. “The S&P 500 at an 8% compound rate places the same $10,000 near $15,900, which is the realistic hurdle Tesla must beat. Even so, there are some major headwinds.”\nThose headwinds include “litigation and regulatory exposure” that could drive Tesla’s downside more than macro trends, according to Cummings.\n“A single autonomous-related fatality that triggers a regulatory halt can cut Tesla’s valuation by tens of billions within days,” he said. “The insurance and legal systems still have yet to fully price in autonomous driving and the results, which creates something of a hot potato.”\n\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nLooking Beyond the EV Market Another thing to keep an eye on is how Tesla’s non-EV businesses perform over the next few years — mainly its energy generation/storage and other services. These businesses are considered by many to be the stock’s main growth drivers.\n“A $10,000 investment in Tesla right now depends less on the EV side than people think,” said Edward Corona, founder of The Options Oracle AI Trade Manager . “I honestly don’t believe Tesla’s main focus is cars anymore — but they still need the car business to keep the money flowing while they build everything else. And Elon has about one trillion reasons now to make sure the long-term plan pays off.”\nThe “one trillion reasons” comment refers to Musk’s new compensation package , which could be worth about $1 trillion if certain milestones are met.\n\nStory Continues\nBy 2030, a $10,000 investment will “come down to whether Tesla can use the EV side to fund the bigger vision without letting margins fall apart,” Corona told GOBankingRates. “If they balance that right, the stock could look a lot different in a few years. If they don’t, investors will feel it. Tesla’s future isn’t about selling cars — it’s about whether the rest of the plan actually gets executed.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Things have only gone downhill for the stock as Wall Street began doubting the story.\nORCL stock has plummeted by over 40% from its peak after Q2 earnings. FY 2026 earnings disappointed investors. Analysts began piling concerns about how overextended data center spending was and whether it was even sustainable for Oracle to fund the growth. Investors baked in a valuation that would only make sense if Oracle managed to grow at a blistering pace for years with ever-growing margins.\nBut now that ORCL stock is down from its peak, should you buy the dip or jump ship? Let's first take a look at what's wrong here.\n\nWhy investors are dumping ORCL stock Investors' pet peeve with Oracle is that the funding is proving to be quite unreliable. News came out that Blue Owl Capital was withdrawing from its funding commitments, meaning that Oracle's $10 billion Michigan data center was in jeopardy. Oracle denied this and said that the news reports were \"incorrect\". Oracle's Partner, Related Digital, said that Blue Owl did not withdraw unequivocally and that the company still had others willing to fund the project.\n\nIn any case, this has thrown sand into the gears. Q2 FY 2026 didn't help, either.\nIt invited a fresh wave of criticism after Oracle reported $16.06 billion in revenue, up 14.22% year-over-year. This missed the estimates by $134.2 million. EPS did beat estimates by a wide margin, but this was due to a one-time boost from Oracle selling its Ampere stake.\nThe Wall Street Journal pointed to another \"squishy number\" that investors are paying more attention to as Oracle's story looks more brittle. Remaining performance obligations (RPOs) have surged to $523 billion. What are these RPOs? Sales that management believes are probable. Half a trillion dollars of \"probable\" sales looked more or less guaranteed a few months back. But with that Blue Owl debacle and the AI buildout catching more flak, Wall Street is less willing to price that in.\n\nStory Continues\nTime to go bottom fishing with ORCL stock? If those RPOs do convert to sales, the picture looks rosier than ever, but it's still worth keeping in mind how quickly things can go wrong. For example, Oracle has a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, set to begin in 2027.\nIf the AI train continues full steam ahead, maybe it's possible that OpenAI will be able to spend $300 billion on Oracle cloud compute resources over five years, as per the agreement. I don't believe that \"maybe\" will translate into reality, as OpenAI does not have $300 billion.\n\nPer Oracle, they expect to grow Cloud Infrastructure revenue \"...77% to $18 billion this fiscal year—and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.\" The majority of Oracle's promised revenue generation over the coming fiscal years is expected to be from OpenAI.\nFor this to happen, we need to assume that OpenAI has the money ready and that Oracle can finish its data centers in time. The first one is unthinkable, since OpenAI is falling behind other AI competitors and expects to be deep in the red until at least 2029. The latter argument is already crumbling, with Oracle delaying \"some\" data center projects for OpenAI to 2028.\nWhat you're actually betting on, and why I wouldn't take the bet Buying Oracle stock is now essentially a bet on OpenAI and its commitments. I do not believe that OpenAI will be able to buy $300 billion worth of compute over the agreement period. OpenAI won't be on the hook and can cancel or downsize the agreement, with Oracle's shareholders taking most of the blow.\n\nWeather, extreme demand, and finicky data center funding will inevitably push deadlines, too.\nIf you do want to bet on AI and data centers, you're better off buying Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , or Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) instead. They aren't as dependent on RPO figures from one startup.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

ADBE’s Firefly, Express and Creative Cloud applications currently integrate models from partners, including Google, OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, Luma, Runway, Topaz Labs and Eleven Labs.\n\nAdobe’s launch of Premiere Mobile in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 strengthened its footprint as a leading provider of next-generation AI video editing. The company announced a partnership with Google and YouTube, which is helping creators receive Adobe Premiere’s video editing tools in a new content creation space called Create for YouTube Shorts at the Premiere mobile app. Expansion of ad network partnerships with Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Snap and TikTok is a key catalyst for Adobe.\n\nThe company has recently entered into a strategic partnership with Runaway, where ADBE will utilize Runaway’s video technology, along with its own creative tools, to develop the next generation of video workflows. Adobe will be Runaway’s preferred API creativity partner, which will help ADBE’s customers get access to Runaway’s latest models. Its latest models, including Runaway’s new GEN-4.5, which are available only in Adobe Firefly, will be available to all ADBE’s clients.\n\nApart from an expanding partner base, Adobe’s strategy of infusing AI into its portfolio is driving growth, as reflected by the fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. Adobe exited the year with annual recurring revenues (ARR) of $25.2 billion, indicating 11.5% year-over-year growth, and management expects it to continue to rise to $25.6 at the end of fiscal 2026. The Semrush acquisition is expected to further boost Adobe’s ARR growth.\n\nAdobe Faces Tough Competition in the AI Domain ADBE’s AI business is minuscule compared with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in the AI Copilot business. Microsoft now has 900 million monthly active users of AI features across its products, with over 150 million monthly active users of first-party Copilots. More than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, with major customers deploying tens of thousands of seats.\n\nAlphabet’s focus on leveraging AI to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search and Google Cloud. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries. AI Mode is now available in more than 40 languages globally and has more than 75 million daily active users. GOOGL added 100 improvements to AI Mode in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nADBE’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Adobe shares have lost 21.6% in a year, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 22.9% and the Zacks Computer Software industry’s appreciation of 6.3%.\nAdobe Stock Lags Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nADBE stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of C.\n\nIn terms of trailing price/book, Adobe shares are trading at a higher multiple of 12.71 compared with the broader sector’s 10.76.\nADBE Stock is Overvalued\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $6.28 billion, indicating 9.89% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at $5.86 per share, which has inched up by 19 cents over the past 60 days, suggesting 15.4% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdobe Inc.

The Semrush acquisition will enhance Adobe’s expanding portfolio of AI-driven customer experience solutions, including AEM, Adobe Analytics and Adobe Brand Concierge.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, Adobe expects total revenues between $25.9 billion and $26.1 billion. Adobe expects Business Professionals and Consumers’ subscription revenue between $7.35 billion and $7.4 billion. Creative and Marketing Professionals subscription revenues are expected to be between $17.75 billion and $17.9 billion.\n\nHowever, Adobe’s AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet. OpenAI, Salesforce, Midjourney and Canva are other major competitors.\n\nThe Case for Alphabet Stock Alphabet’s initiatives to infuse AI in Search and Google Cloud are noteworthy. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. In November, Alphabet launched Gemini 3, its latest state-of-the-art reasoning model. It now powers Search, via AI Mode. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in nearly 120 countries and territories in English can use Gemini 3 Pro by selecting “Thinking with 3 Pro” from the model drop-down menu in AI Mode.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding AI infrastructure is helping it win enterprise clients. Google Cloud Platform’s prospects remain robust, driven by strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs (led by seventh-generation Ironwood) and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for the latest Gemini and other AI models, and other services, including cybersecurity and data analytics. Google Cloud is also benefiting from strong Gen AI adoption due to leading models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues from products developed on Google’s Gen AI models surged more than 200% year over year.\n\nAccelerating spending on AI infrastructure bodes well for GOOGL stock. For 2025, Alphabet now expects to spend capital expenditures between $91 billion and $93 billion, up from the previous estimate of $85 billion. The company expects capital expenditure to increase significantly in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL Earnings Estimate Revision Steady, ADBE’s Goes South The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $10.58 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating a 31.6% increase over 2024’s reported figure.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nThe consensus mark for Adobe’s fiscal 2026 earnings has declined by nine cents to $23.44 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 12% growth over fiscal 2025.\n\nAdobe Inc. Price and Consensus Adobe Inc. price-consensus-chart | Adobe Inc. Quote\n\nBoth GOOGL’s and ADBE’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Alphabet’s average surprise of 18.74% is better than Adobe’s surprise of 2.25%, reflecting the good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.\n\nStock Price Performance & Valuation: ADBE vs. GOOGL Adobe shares have underperformed the Alphabet stock in a year. The ADBE stock dropped 20.9% while GOOGL surged 63% over the time frame.\nADBE and GOOGL Share Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBoth Alphabet and Adobe are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D and C, respectively.\n\nIn terms of forward 12-month price/sales, Alphabet shares are trading at 9.79X, higher than Adobe’s 5.65X.\nGOOGL and ADBE Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. However, Adobe is suffering from the negative impact of stiff competition in the AI and Generative AI space, offering GOOGL an edge.\n\nCurrently, Adobe and Alphabet carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

      "Content": "2 Stocks I'd Happily Hold Through Any Stock Market Crash\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Artificial intelligence (AI) competition has brought out the best in Alphabet.\nThe company has a big structural cost advantage that should continue to widen.\nAmazon, meanwhile, does not get enough credit for its leadership in robotics or its own custom AI chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWith the market near all-time highs and murmurs of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble and even a potential market crash, there are some stocks I still wouldn't sell.\nWhile I'm not expecting a big market pullback, let's look at two stocks I'd continue to hold and likely be buying more of if a crash were to happen.\n1. Alphabet I think Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is going to be one of the biggest long-term winners in AI. The reason is that AI is pushing the company to innovate, making its products better.\nI'd argue that OpenAI is actually one of the best things to happen to the stock. Before OpenAI came along, Alphabet was largely viewed as a great company, but one that was bloated and stagnant. However, competition not only brought out the best in Alphabet, but it also highlighted some of the tech innovations it had been working on behind the scenes.\n\nThe biggest of these behind-the-scenes innovations was its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Alphabet had been using and advancing these custom chips for more than a decade, but it wasn't until recently that investors began to see their importance. These chips give Alphabet a huge structural cost advantage, both within its cloud computing unit and also with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference. Now, even other companies are set to begin deploying Alphabet's chips at scale to run some of their AI workloads within Google Cloud.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has incorporated its Gemini model throughout its portfolio of products, making them better, which is driving revenue growth. Meanwhile, by incorporating AI into Google Search, Maps, and Gmail, as well as becoming an AI assistant with Android and soon Apple devices, the company is meeting people where they are active every day. That's just a huge advantage that will grow with time.\n\nRight now, Alphabet is in the midst of riding a virtuous cycle, given its vertical integration edge. That's why it's a stock to hold through any market crash.\n2. Amazon Like Alphabet, I really like what Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been doing behind the scenes. The company does not get nearly the credit it deserves in robotics, because it is using them in its own fulfillment centers to drive efficiency rather than selling them to generate revenue. But make no mistake: Amazon is one of the world's foremost companies in robotics.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company has more than 1 million robots in its distribution centers, all of which are coordinated by its DeepFleet AI model. These robots keep becoming more advanced and able to handle more complex tasks. Meanwhile, Amazon is also using AI to help reduce delivery times through optimizing routes, locating hard-to-find drop-off locations for drivers, and determining which warehouses are best to store certain items. This has been leading to strong operating leverage, with the company seeing its segment-adjusted operating income soar 28% last quarter on an 11% increase in revenue.\n\nAnd while its custom AI chips are not as battle-tested as Alphabet's, Amazon is also making strong inroads in this area, which should help power its cloud computing results moving forward. It built out a world-class data center for Anthropic using Amazon's Trainium chips, which is still ramping up. Meanwhile, Amazon has been in talks with OpenAI about taking a stake in the company, which would also see the LLM company start to deploy some of its chips for its workloads. The two companies agreed earlier on a seven-year, $38 billion AWS (Amazon Web Services) computing deal, but that would be powered by Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\nGiven its robotics and e-commerce leadership, combined with its position in cloud computing, Amazon looks like a long-term winner, whether the market crashes next year or not.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "45% of Alphabet’s $3 Billion Hidden Portfolio Is in Just 2 White-Hot Stocks\n\nRich Duprey\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:55 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nASTS\n\nPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) invested $155M in AST SpaceMobile ( ASTS ) in early 2024. Those shares are now worth almost $700M.\nAST SpaceMobile successfully deployed BlueBird 6 on Wednesday. It is the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit.\nPlanet Labs ( PL ) reported record revenue of $81.3M in fiscal Q3. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672M.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAlphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) dominates the search engine market with over 90% share and powers billions of daily queries through Google Search. Its Google Cloud division has gained market share from leaders Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nA lesser-known aspect is Alphabet also directly invests in public companies through its venture arms GV and CapitalG. This portfolio held 38 stocks at the end of the third quarter with assets under management of about $2.5 billion and spanning sectors like healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI), and technology.\nYet there is one sector where Alphabet has placed its biggest bets: space. According to McKinsey, the space sector is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, so it's not surprising Alphabet is attempting to cash in on the explosive growth expected. What's notable about Alphabet's space investments is that it has concentrated its focus on just two stocks, which comprise 45% of the portfolio's AUM at current valuations.\n\nAST SpaceMobile ( NASDAQ:ASTS ) and Planet Labs ( NYSE:PL ) stand out as the largest positions in the portfolio, so let's see whether they warrant an investment from you, too.\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) AST SpaceMobile builds a space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by standard smartphones. Alphabet participated in a $155 million strategic investment round in early 2024 alongside AT&T ( NYSE:T ) and Vodafone ( NASDAQ:VOD ), supporting the company's satellite constellation development.\n\nGoogle collaborates on product development, testing, and implementation for network connectivity on Android devices. In the first quarter of 2025, Alphabet added 8.9 million shares valued at approximately $203 million. Today, those shares are worth almost $700 million and represent the portfolio's largest holding, or 23.3% of the total.\nAST achieved a key milestone on Wednesday with the successful launch and orbital deployment of BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit. This validates its technology for direct-to-device connectivity.\n\nStory Continues\nThe satellite stock's shares have surged 270% year-to-date as it advances its launch schedule and partnerships with over 50 mobile network operators serving billions of subscribers. The stock has been volatile, but has gained significant ground as it attained new milestones.\nAST SpaceMobile's focus on eliminating connectivity gaps aligns with the growth in satellite broadband, but analysts still give it mixed reviews. Some rate it a Buy for its long-term potential, while others are concerned about execution risks, limited revenue, and ongoing losses. Weiss Ratings , for example, just reiterated its Sell rating on the stock while Barclays downgraded it in October from Overweight to Underweight.\n\nAST SpaceMobile is probably best suited for risk-tolerant investors who may see an opportunity in it capturing even a slice of the projected $100 billion satellite broadband market.\nPlanet Labs (PL) Planet Labs operates a fleet of over 200 satellites providing daily global imagery and geospatial data for sectors including agriculture, defense, finance, and climate monitoring. Alphabet holds a roughly 10% stake, with data integrations supporting Google Earth and AI models for environmental analytics.\n\nAlphabet's position in Planet Labs is currently valued at approximately $650 million after the stock jumped following its fiscal year 2026 Q3 earnings report, making it the portfolio's second-largest holding. The valuation is 56% above where it stood on the date of Alphabet's 13F-HR filing.\nPlanet Labs reported record quarterly revenue of $81.3 million, up 33% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672 million, driven by defense and intelligence contracts.\nThe space stock's shares have rocketed over 400% in 2025 following hefty earnings beats and analyst upgrades. Morgan Stanley hiked its price target from $4.50 to $20 per share, which suggests Planet Labs is fairly priced, but the consensus has a sub-$15 target, which is why the stock has a Hold rating overall.\n\nIn the expanding $1.8 trillion space economy by 2035, Planet Labs benefits from geospatial AI applications that should contribute to revenue growth outpacing the sector. Aggressive investors may view it as a thematic play, but most investors should probably wait for a more attractive entry point following its huge run-up.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\n\nNalak Das\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:38 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of the three above-mentioned stocks year to date.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon.com Inc. Global e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN’s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon’s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is “Growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\n\nExtensive AI Applications Amazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called “Project Rainier.” This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\n\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers’ queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\n\nStory continues\nAMZN’s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance Amazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft Corp. Microsoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT’s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company’s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT’s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength Microsoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN’s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT’s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\n\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc. The undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\n\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company’s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions Zacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is the biggest transaction Nvidia has made so far to buy anything. The goal of the move is to make Nvidia more competitive in the quickly increasing market for AI hardware and data centers.The business will use Groq's specialized chip designs in future products and hire Jonathan Ross, the startup's CEO, and other top engineers. Ross was part of the team that started Google's own AI chip initiative.The deal is part of a larger wave of investments worth billions of dollars that are changing the AI infrastructure environment. Recently, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta, and Amazon have made big promises to increase their AI processing power and work with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and CoreWeave.Analysts argue that Nvidia's partnership with Groq will help it stay ahead of AMD, Intel, and bespoke chipmakers in the AI accelerator market by giving it access to more technologies. The transaction also supports Nvidia's plan to improve vertical integration as demand for AI computing keeps going up until 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI Bubble Fears Scaring You Off? Buy This Magnificent 7 Stock for Stability.\n\nMohit Oberoi\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\n2025 is now drawing to a close, and while the broader markets are set to deliver double-digit returns for the third consecutive year, we saw a rotation of sorts. After leading the stock market rally from the front over the previous two years, the “Magnificent 7” stocks took a back seat. And if not for the 65% rise in Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), the group’s weighted average returns would have trailed that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX). While some Magnificent 7 names, particularly Nvidia (NVDA), delivered triple-digit returns in 2023 and 2024, this year none have found a way even into the top 25 gainers in the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX).\n\nBased on our perception of the technology, we may or may not term the 2025 price action as the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble bursting, but one thing was clear this year: investors are not buying into the ever-rising AI capex story and are increasingly getting worried about the toll they are taking on tech companies’ cash flows.\nMore News from Barchart As the FDA Approves a Wegovy Pill, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold Novo Nordisk Stock?\nThis Dividend Giant Yielding 4.5% Is Wall Street’s Top Telecom Pick for 2026\nHave a MERRY Christmas With These 9 Unusually Active Options\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nApple Might Have Underinvested in AI But things are not as straightforward, and just as markets are punishing companies for their overexuberance towards AI, underinvestment isn’t getting rewarded either, with Apple (AAPL) being a prime example.\nEver since the AI euphoria began in 2023, Apple has been trying to shed the perception that it is slacking on the technology even as other tech companies race ahead. This is not to say that the Tim Cook-led company is resting on its past laurels and has taken several measures to catch up. Among others, Apple has gradually added AI features to its iPhones as part of “Apple Intelligence” and plans to release the updated Siri next year.\n\nIt has increased its capex towards AI, and during the fiscal Q3 2025 earnings call in July, Cook said that Apple is “reallocating a fair number of people to focus on AI features within the company.” Without providing specifics, Cook discussed an “exciting road map ahead” for new AI products and did not rule out the possibility of a major acquisition to bolster its AI capabilities. I, however, have serious doubts about the company acquiring Perplexity, as was previously rumored, given their vastly different approaches to customer privacy.\n\nStory Continues\nPrivacy Has Been Apple’s USP Notably, one of the reasons Apple is running behind in AI is the company’s focus on privacy, which is atypical for AI that feeds on massive amounts of data. However, I believe it could be the company’s unique selling proposition (USP), as users concerned about AI companies snooping on their data would find solace in the Apple ecosystem, which prioritizes user privacy at its core.\n\nOverall, I would say that Apple took quite a balanced and measured approach towards AI, and while it did miss out on first-mover advantage, the Cupertino-based giant was never known for being one. Some of its most successful products, like the iPod, iPad, and iPhone, were launched when competitors were already offering competing products.\nApple’s Valuations Are Quite Rich Apple was never really a bet on AI, and the company’s efforts to capitalize on the technology, which is being touted as the next big thing since the internet, leave a lot to be desired. The company, however, took baby steps in a typical Apple way and is trying to improvise upon what others are doing—as the common adage about the company goes, “Apple doesn't need to be first. They just need to be the best.”\n\nThat said, Apple would be one name to double down on if you are worried about an AI bubble, as the stock never really benefited from the AI rally and is therefore at the least risk in a crash. Apple could be a bastion of safety and could see buying interest if the long-feared AI bubble bursts. Otherwise, I don’t see the stock outperforming the average Magnificent 7 peer by a significant margin in 2026. While strong expected sales of the iPhone 17 would keep sentiment buoyed, there is not much on the table at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of around 34x.\nAAPL Stock Forecast The consensus view is not overtly bullish for AAPL stock either, and it is rated as a “Moderate Buy” based on the consolidated ratings of 40 analysts tracked by Barchart . The stock’s mean target price of $290.85 is just about 7% higher than current price levels. Among its Magnificent 7 peers, only Tesla (TSLA) has a lower rating than Apple.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, GOOG.

After almost exactly nine years in my portfolio, my Alphabet Class A stock was up by 348%. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had gained 156% over the same period.\nBut I didn't rebalance this successful position. Now, those Alphabet shares have gained a total of 2,084% (or 2,096% if you include the minimal dividends the Google parent is paying nowadays). Every time I look at that chart, it reminds me of the classic Motley Fool Rule Breakers philosophy: Let winners keep winning.\nThis winner is winning again On that note, Alphabet is up to its old market-beating tricks again. The stock is up 66% over the last year, outperforming the other six members of the \" Magnificent Seven \" club. Many investors back away from showstopping gains like these, fearing that the greatest gains must be behind them.\n\nThe move since 2019 is just one piece of evidence that Alphabet has what it takes to continue growing, even from a $3.8 trillion market cap. It's a leading force in online search and advertising, artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, early quantum computing research, driverless taxi services...\nI could keep going, but you get the drift. Alphabet is winning in so many ways, it's kind of hard to keep track of all the trophies.\nThe best time to buy was yesterday In other words, it's not too late to buy Alphabet stock.\nImagine looking back at December 2025 from the end of 2030 or (even better!) 2040. You'll almost certainly be better off if you doubled down on Alphabet just below $330 per share than if you had sold it this winter. Yes, even if your stock position was up by thousands of percent already.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Stock Will Be the Biggest Quantum Computing Winner of 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nIONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nKey Points Upstarts like IonQ and Rigetti Computing have boom-or-bust potential in 2026.\nLegacy tech players like Alphabet have a greater chance of success.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nQuantum computing hype has gone through two separate boom-and-bust cycles in 2025. At the end of 2024, quantum computing investing was all the rage, thanks to a breakthrough announcement by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) that brought quantum computing into the mainstream. After these stocks rose rapidly in December 2024, they crashed immediately after entering 2025. Throughout the year, these stocks slowly gained momentum before crashing again around October.\n\nClearly, quantum computing stocks are quite volatile. Their performance is more closely tied to the market's appetite for risk rather than actual business performance, which can make finding the right time to purchase these stocks tricky. However, I think there's a better way to invest in quantum computing that may increase the chance of reaping profits during the next few years.\nFinding the ultimate quantum computing winner will be difficult There are two buckets of quantum computing stocks: Upstarts and legacy tech companies. Upstarts include companies like IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) , Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) , and D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) , which are completely devoted to producing viable quantum computing technology. They get their funding from various research contracts or by going to the public market to raise capital.\n\nThese stocks are incredibly risky, but would have a huge payoff if their technology pans out. The reality is that most of the publicly traded and private quantum computing start-ups will go bankrupt before viable quantum computing technology becomes available in roughly 2030.\nWhile some investors may have the risk tolerance for this type of investing, few do. As a result, I think most investors would be better off owning some legacy tech companies.\nCompanies in this cohort are pursuing quantum computing on the side as a complementary part of their business. This group includes companies like Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and IBM (NYSE: IBM) , among others. While these companies will benefit greatly from having in-house quantum computing available, it isn't critical to their success. As a result, these companies are far safer, as they have viable cash flows funding their quantum computing research. If they lost the race to develop useful quantum computing technology, their existing businesses would still be OK.\nI think most investors are better off picking a stock in this category, and I can think of few better than Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is one of the leaders in the quantum computing race Although you will hear announcements from the quantum computing start-ups quite often, you will only get updates from Alphabet on its quantum computing progress about once a year. This isn't because Alphabet is slow; it's because it doesn't need to broadcast all the breakthroughs it's making to sustain investor support.\n\nAlphabet's most recent announcement was significant, as it announced the first verifiable quantum computing advantage. Its Willow quantum computing chip ran an algorithm 13,000 times faster than the world's fastest supercomputer. While that's an incredible improvement, it's not so fast that the performance couldn't be independently verified. Furthermore, the algorithm it runs actually has real-world implications.\nThis algorithm can help scientists understand nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is the technology used in MRI scans. Alphabet may be closer to having a real-world effect than most realize, and its top-tier quantum computing technology is evidence of that.\nAlthough it's possible that some of the smaller quantum computing upstarts could get hot again in 2026, I'd prefer a more reliable bet like Alphabet. Alphabet has a lot going for it, with a leading generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, a strong base business (Google Search), and a thriving cloud computing wing. All this combines to make Alphabet a great investment in 2026, and if it can deliver more quantum computing breakthroughs, that will be a cherry on top.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "What Is the Smartest Quantum Computing Stock to Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nQBTS\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Pure-play developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are the hottest quantum computing stocks right now.\nBig tech giants are also exploring quantum computing in addition to their established generative artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nNvidia is quietly building a quantum AI ecosystem that stands to benefit, no matter which systems succeed in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOne of the hottest pockets of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm in 2025 was quantum computing. Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

(NASDAQ: BIDU ) is one of the best rising tech stocks to buy now .\nPhoto by Samuele Errico Piccarini on Unsplash\nA significant escalation in the global race toward autonomous mobility occurred on December 22, 2025, when Uber and Lyft announced partnerships with Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) to launch driverless taxi trials in the UK in 2026. This partnership will see Baidu’s Apollo Go RT6 robotaxis enter London’s ride-hailing networks in 2026. With these rapid developments, the stage will be set for the first head-to-head competition between U.S. and Chinese autonomous driving leaders in a major European capital. This update comes shortly after Alphabet’s Waymo began supervised testing in the city.\n\nThe UK’s appeal as a testing ground has grown recently, with the Automated Vehicles Act 2024 clarifying liability by shifting responsibility from passengers to authorized self-driving operators. The region now offers regulatory certainty largely absent across the European Union.\nMeanwhile, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)’s broader autonomous strategy has drawn investor attention, with Citi placing the stock on a 90-day positive catalyst watch on December 8, 2025. The investment bank cited improving disclosure around AI-driven revenues and Ernie model investments as potential value unlocks. Citi reiterated its “Buy” rating on the stock with an $181 price target, citing growing confidence in the company’s outlook after meeting with management.\nOn December 7, 2025, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was one of ARK’s biggest additions, with the investment firm acquiring 119,982 Baidu shares worth $14.24 million. This follows the firm’s cautious stance on Chinese stocks for most of 2025.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) provides internet search and online marketing solutions. It is known for the Baidu App, Baidu Search, Baidu Feed, Haokan, Quanmin, Baidu Post Bar, Baidu Knows, and many other products.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of BIDU as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 To Avoid\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:56 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nUNH\n\nAXP\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Lots of investors don’t recognize just how important the credit card company American Express is to Berkshire Hathaway.\nThere was a time when Alphabet would have never even been allowed to become part of Berkshire's portfolio.\nHealth insurer UnitedHealth Group’s challenges are much greater than the company-specific ones.\n10 stocks we like better than American Express ›\n\nWith Warren Buffett's 55-year tenure as Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and chief stock-picker set to come to a close at the end of this year, plenty of investors are understandably disappointed. After all, they'll no longer be able to copy the occasional pick from the Oracle of Omaha's market-beating portfolio. If you're looking for an idea you know for sure is a Buffett-approved pick, you'd better act soon before these stock-selection duties are passed on to his successor.\nStill, it's not like Buffett's been perfect. Even he acknowledges he makes the occasional investing misstep.\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at a couple of current Berkshire holdings that would likely work for your portfolio as well, and one name Warren Buffett recently bought that you might not want to ... at least not yet, and maybe never.\nA stock to buy: American Express Given how infrequently it's highlighted as a Buffett pick, many investors are surprised to learn that credit card powerhouse American Express (NYSE: AXP) is Berkshire Hathaway's second-biggest stock trade; the position is worth nearly $58 billion and accounts for more than 18% of the conglomerate's portfolio. Even more telling is that it's also one of Berkshire's longest-held undisturbed holdings. Whereas Buffett's been steadily paring back supersized stakes in Apple and Bank of America , Berkshire's 151.6 million shares in American Express are the same number of shares it has owned since first buying it back in 2006. This speaks volumes about long-term confidence in the company.\n\nThat being said, it's not difficult to understand why Buffett is such a big fan.\nWhile not as big as Visa or Mastercard, nor growing as quickly as either one right now, AmEx caters to more affluent consumers who aren't really rattled by economic headwinds. The company's third-quarter revenue growth accelerated to a year-over-year pace of nearly 11%, coming in at a little over $18.4 billion versus analysts' estimates of only $18.05 billion. Then, in early December, American Express reported a 9% year-over-year increase in consumer spending during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, with its wealthiest cardholders pumping up their spending even more, proving the card company's resilience.\n\nStory Continues\nDo you know that AXP shares are one of Wall Street's few stocks presently trading above their consensus target price, prompting some interested investors to balk. That's why it wouldn't be completely crazy to see if a better price becomes available in the near future.\nJust don't let discipline turn into stubbornness. This is one of those cases where a ticker's price leads its consensus target just as much as it's led by it.\nIn other words, don't sweat the ho-hum consensus too much. Instead, just focus on the consistent quality of American Express's business, as Buffett does. The premium you're paying for it eventually ends up paying for itself.\nA stock to buy: Alphabet Just a few years ago, the idea of Berkshire Hathaway taking on a position in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was unthinkable. Buffett's simply never been a big fan of technology stocks, saying he didn't understand them well enough to assess them.\nSomething's clearly changed in the meantime, though. While Berkshire's stake in Google's parent is a modest 17.8 million shares worth only $5.6 billion, the fact that Buffett's allowed any -sized piece of this tech outfit into the portfolio is actually a pretty big deal ... even if it was likely mostly encouraged by one of his stock-picking lieutenants.\n\nThe thing is, this pick actually makes good sense even if it's not quite the Oracle of Omaha's typical fare. Google's share of the global search engine market is holding firm at 90%, according to Statcounter, while its Android operating system is installed on more than 70% of the world's mobile devices. And, while Synergy Research Group reports that Google's piece of the worldwide cloud computing market is a fairly modest 13% versus Amazon 's 29% and Microsoft 's 20%, Google's share is growing faster than that of its two top rivals, with its revenue improving 33% year over year last quarter.\nIt's still not always an easy business to understand, particularly for anyone who isn't digitally native (or at least familiar with consumer-facing technologies due to regular usage of them). It's not difficult to understand, however, that Alphabet is investment-worthy not just because it offers a handful of marketable products, but because this company was built from the ground up to remain ready, willing, and able to adapt to an ever-changing technological landscape.\n\nA stock to avoid: UnitedHealth Group Finally, while the superficial logic of the pick makes enough sense, Berkshire's recent addition of health insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) to its stock portfolio may not be one you want to follow.\nThe chief motivation here is the discounted price on shares of a seemingly stable company. From April's share price peak near $605 to August's trough of less than $235 -- more than a 60% setback -- stemming from combination of unexpectedly high reimbursement costs, a DOJ investigation into its Medicare billing practices, and the surprising resignation of UnitedHealth's CEO Andrew Witty in May, it felt like all the bad news that could be baked in had been baked in. And, perhaps it was.\n\nThere's a bigger secular headwind blowing against the entire health insurance industry, however, that's not going to be overcome with new leadership or tighter control of the company's operation. That's a nationwide effort to keep consumers' healthcare costs contained. The White House recently inked deals with nine different pharmaceutical companies to lower Americans' drug prices, for instance, and unless something changes, the impending end to subsidies called for by the Affordable Care Act could ultimately undermine demand for UnitedHealth's ACA coverage plans. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice's scrutiny of UnitedHealth's Medicare billing is a microcosm of the frustration with the entire healthcare industry's ever-growing lack of regulatory accountability. All of it works against the company.\n\nSure, UnitedHealth may well (and likely will) push through whatever the future holds. As it stands right now, though, there's too much risk and too much uncertainty for too little upside to justify holding this name. More clarity is needed, and that's going to take more time than has been given.

      "Content": "Dan Ives Loves This Under-the-Radar AI Stock for 2026\n\nNauman Khan\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nWhen investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, individuals tend to focus on the large, mega-cap stocks that are all the rage, yet the next wave of AI may more comfortably benefit smaller infrastructure businesses. As capital shifts from model development to deployment, people are demanding more cloud capacity, superior compute power, and AI-ready data centers, making the demand hot.\n\nOne quietly notable name that has been catching Wall Street's eye is Nebius (NBIS). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives just listed NBIS as his top AI infrastructure pick for 2026, arguing the company’s positioning and tech make it a likely acquisition target for a hyperscaler such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), or Amazon (AMZN).\nMore News from Barchart Super Micro Computer Stock Tumbles, But Investors are Piling into Its Call Options - Time to Buy SMCI?\nA $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\nRKLB Stock Bullish Diagonal Trade Targets a Price of $85 by January 16th\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nFor investors looking beyond the obvious AI leaders, here’s a closer look at why NBIS is drawing bullish attention heading into 2026.\nAbout NBIS Stock Based in Amsterdam, Nebius provides full-stack cloud and GPU-accelerated AI infrastructure across Europe and North America. It builds sustainable data centers and rents AI‑optimized compute clusters with liquid cooling and high‑power GPUs to hyperscalers and enterprises. The company emerged from a restructuring of the former Yandex infrastructure business and now combines its core AI cloud service with subsidiaries in autonomous vehicles and education technology.\n\nValued at around $23 billion by market cap, NBIS stock has been stellar this year. After languishing post-restructuring, the shares rallied over the summer, in part when Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed a stake in the company, peaking above $140 by October. A surge in new contracts with tech giants, such as Microsoft and Meta (META), further fueled investor enthusiasm. Until now, Nebius has gained roughly 225% year-to-date (YTD), despite a pullback from the recent high.\nThat performance comes with clear trade-offs. Nebius now trades at valuation levels that leave little room for error. Its trailing price-to-sales multiple sits in the mid-50s, far above the sector median, which trades closer to 4x, and its own 5-year historical average, which sits at 24x.\nIn short, the market is pricing Nebius as a future cornerstone of AI infrastructure. That may prove correct, but it also means any slowdown in contract growth, pricing pressure, or capital-spending misstep could weigh heavily on the stock. At today’s levels, execution matters as much as vision.\n\nStory Continues\nImpact of Ives’ Acquisition Thesis Dan Ives’s endorsement, calling Nebius “ripe” for a 2026 acquisition by a hyperscaler, gave the stock a short-term boost. The day his comments were publicized, NBIS spiked about 14% following the news. Investors interpreted it as validation of Nebius’s strategic value. Ives specifically noted that among AI “neocloud” firms, Nebius is the most likely buyout candidate, which fueled positive sentiment.\n\nFor the company, this means fresh investor interest and higher trading volume, though it’s too early to say if any deal is imminent. In the near term, the news underscores Nebius’s industry stature; if true, a 2026 deal could be transformative. But even absent an actual acquisition, the hype helps spotlight Nebius’s core business and contracts, potentially improving access to capital.\nNebius Delivered Solid Revenue Yet Widened Losses Nebius delivered a strong quarter in Q3 2025, posting revenue of $146.1 million, up 355% year-over-year (YoY), as demand for AI infrastructure surged and large new contracts came online. This growth was largely driven by strong uptake across its core AI infrastructure business, which now accounts for the vast majority of results.\n\nProfitability, however, remains a work in progress. Nebius reported a GAAP net loss of $119.6 million, wider than a year earlier, reflecting aggressive expansion and rising depreciation tied to new data center capacity. But there was a bright spot below the surface. Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed sharply to $5.2 million, a significant improvement from nearly $46 million last year, as higher revenue began to offset operating expenses.\nOn the other side, spending ramped up sharply as the company accelerated its buildout. Operating cash burn rose to $80.6 million, while capital expenditures jumped to nearly $1.0 billion in the quarter, underscoring how capital-intensive AI infrastructure has become. Even so, Nebius ended the period with a formidable $4.8 billion cash balance, supported by recent equity and debt raises, giving it ample firepower to execute its growth plans.\n\nLooking ahead, management remains aggressive. Nebius is targeting an annualized revenue run rate of $750 million to $1 billion by the end of 2025 and plans to scale connected power capacity to 800 to 1,000 megawatts by 2026, with even more capacity already under contract.\nCEO Arkady Volozh has said the company has effectively sold out its existing capacity, with future capacity already pre-committed. While losses are expected to persist in the near term, the strategy is clear: scale first, optimize later.\nRecent Developments Since the quarter's close, Nebius has continued to make headlines. On Dec. 17, it launched Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 featuring Nvidia’s new Blackwell ultra-power GPUs. The company said it is now “ the first cloud in Europe to operate ” these cutting-edge Nvidia GB300 and HGX B300 systems in production, a technical milestone for customers.\n\nNebius also highlighted its $3 billion AI infrastructure agreement with Meta (announced in September) as a revenue backlog boost. These announcements were viewed positively as further proof of Nebius’s scale and partnerships.\nAnalyst's Perspective on NBIS Stock Wall Street remains broadly positive on NBIS stock, though analysts are clear about the risks. Goldman Sachs reiterated a “Buy” rating in November 2025 and raised its 12-month price target to $155, citing accelerating demand for AI infrastructure and improving visibility on large-scale contracts.\nSimilarly, D.A. Davidson also maintained a “Buy” with a $150 target, while CICC initiated coverage at $143, pointing to Nebius’ growing role in global AI compute buildouts.\n\nTaken together, on average, the rating given by analysts is “Moderate Buy,” and the broader consensus sits at about $150, which implies roughly 70% upside potential, which shows analysts' confidence in Nebius’ growth trajectory rather than near-term profitability.\nHowever, that optimism comes with caveats. Analysts consistently highlight Nebius’ rapid revenue growth and ability to secure large enterprise deals, but many also flag valuation as demanding. The investment case assumes smooth execution, disciplined capital spending, and sustained customer demand. Any stumble could weigh heavily on NBIS stock.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

With power now restored, we want to share an account of our operations during the outage and how we are evolving to better serve the city. The scale of the outage and the sheer number of disabled traffic lights were the primary contributors to city-wide gridlock. As signals went dark across major corridors, the resulting congestion required law enforcement to manually manage intersections. The situation was severe enough that the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management advised residents to stay home, underscoring the extraordinary nature of the weekend’s disruptions. Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology. While the Waymo Driver is designed to handle dark traffic signals as four-way stops, it may occasionally request a confirmation check to ensure it makes the safest choice. While we successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday, the outage created a concentrated spike in these requests. This created a backlog that, in some cases, led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets. We established these confirmation protocols out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment, and we are now refining them to match our current scale. While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the Driver with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.”\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump, giving Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:03 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 a.m. Pacific Time on Aug. 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia, AMD, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\n\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThe transition to Tan comes as Intel is in the middle of an announced $28 billion project to construct microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany . While the factories were originally slated to begin operations this year, that has been delayed to 2030 at the earliest as Intel seeks buyers for the chips those factories are to produce .\n\nStory Continues\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 minutes in the Oval Office Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms - Walden International and Walden Catalyst - did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies, including coming to Intel's formal groundbreaking ceremony in Licking County in 2022 .\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nIntel's venture capitalist CEO Born in Malaysia to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger , and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA 'lifeline' for Intel So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI\n\nOihyun Kim\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:53 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nBLK\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVIDIA has agreed to pay approximately $20 billion to acquire assets from artificial intelligence chip startup Groq, marking the company's largest transaction on record and continuing its strategy of absorbing potential competitors before they can challenge its market dominance.\nThe chipmaker's latest licensing deal mirrors a similar transaction just three months ago, reinforcing the narrative that decentralized AI infrastructure may offer the only alternative to Nvidia's growing dominance.\n\nThreefold Premium in Three Months with Trump Jr. Connection The deal closed just three months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation—a round that included BlackRock, Samsung, Cisco, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. serves as a partner. Nvidia is acquiring all of the company's assets substantially, except its cloud computing business, though Groq framed the transaction as a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"\n\nGroq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who helped create the search giant's Tensor Processing Unit, will join Nvidia along with president Sunny Madra and other senior executives. The startup will continue operating independently under CFO Simon Edwards as its new chief executive.\nA Repeating Playbook The Groq transaction follows a pattern Nvidia established just three months earlier. In September, the company paid over $900 million to hire Enfabrica's CEO and employees while licensing the startup's technology. Both deals use licensing structures rather than outright acquisitions, potentially avoiding the antitrust scrutiny that blocked Nvidia's $40 billion bid for Arm Holdings in 2022.\nThe Kobeissi Letter summarized Nvidia's approach bluntly: \"We will buy you before you can compete with us.\"\n\nTechnical Edge and Competitive Pressure Groq's Language Processing Unit uses on-chip SRAM rather than external DRAM, enabling what the company claims is up to 10x better energy efficiency. This architecture excels at real-time inference but limits model size—a tradeoff Nvidia can now explore within its broader ecosystem.\nThe timing is notable. Google recently unveiled its seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood, and released Gemini 3, trained entirely on TPUs, to top benchmark rankings. Nvidia responded on X: \"We're delighted by Google's success... NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model.\" When incumbents start issuing such reassurance statements, competitive pressure is clearly mounting.\n\nStory Continues\nImplications for Decentralized AI While the deal has no direct impact on cryptocurrency markets, it reinforces the narrative driving decentralized AI computing projects. Platforms like io.net position themselves as alternatives to centralized AI infrastructure.\n\"People can put their own supply onto a network, whether that's data centers or yourself with your laptop, contributing your available GPU power, and getting fairly compensated for it using tokenomics,\" Jack Collier, io.net's Chief Growth Officer, told BeInCrypto. The platform claims enterprise clients, including Leonardo.ai and UC Berkeley, have achieved significant cost savings.\n\nHowever, the gap between narrative and reality remains wide. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq's low-latency technology further extends its technical lead, making it harder for any alternative to offer competitive performance.\nThe transaction also raises questions about independent AI chip development. Cerebras Systems, another Nvidia competitor preparing an IPO, may eventually face similar pressure. Whether it can remain independent or succumb to Nvidia's financial gravity remains to be seen.\nRead original story Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI by Oihyun Kim at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In an interview with Benzinga, Freedom Capital Markets Chief Market Strategist Jay Woods shares his favorite Magnificent 7 stocks heading into 2026 and which of the seven he's avoiding.\n\nFavorite Magnificent 7 Stocks During an interview with Benzinga in September 2025, Woods said to stick with what was working when it came to big tech stocks and the Magnificent 7 stocks heading into the fourth quarter.\nOne of the big tech stocks that shone bright in the fourth quarter is a favorite for Woods heading into 2026.\n\"I love Alphabet over the long term. That's one you put away,\" Woods told Benzinga.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nWoods said Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) was previously caught up in antitrust litigation, which may have hurt the story.\n\"Look at what the stock has done.\"\nWoods said that while the stock has rallied in the fourth quarter, the company could still be undervalued, highlighting the potential for Waymo and the undervaluation of the company's YouTube asset.\n\"That growth continues at an alarming rate.\"\nAnother Magnificent 7 stock Woods highlighted for 2026 is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ).\n\n\"I think Tesla's a story to watch in 2026.\"\nWoods said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk survived Washington, D.C., and came out of a social media battle with President Donald Trump \"unscathed.\"\nThe market expert highlights Musk's new pay package and the history he has with beating metrics for compensation that many people view as significantly challenging.\n\"He had a pay package that he hit all metrics when it came to EV sales.\"\nWoods said Musk's new incentives include robotics, market capitalization and autonomous driving.\nTesla stock also looks strong heading into 2026 on technical levels, Woods told Benzinga, highlighting a breakout on the one-year chart.\n\"When you break out and now are going into a new year with momentum and you have a leader like Musk who's incentivized for the stock to do well, this is the fuel you want to see.\"\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nWoods said Tesla stock has technical setups, momentum and a leader focused on hitting incentives heading into the new year.\n\nStory Continues\nThe market expert highlights the $420 level for Tesla stock, a \"great number in Musk World,\" along with support at $460 as potential downside levels to watch. Woods sees Tesla stock potentially trading in the mid-$600s, which would provide around a 33% gain from current levels.\n\"I think a $666 target because we like fun numbers with Elon Musk is achievable given the trajectory that this stock is on both technically and the fundamental possibilities behind him focusing on his job.\"\n\nLeast Favorite Magnificent 7 Stocks While Woods has his eyes set on Alphabet and Tesla among the Magnificent 7 stocks for 2026, there are a few of the seven stocks he's avoiding.\n\"Meta is a stock that is now in a downtrend, a stock that has put so much money and emphasis into its spend and we're not seeing the benefits from it,\" Woods said.\n\nWoods said that while he loves what Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is doing with Instagram, the stock has broken down technically as it fails to get back above its 200-day moving average.\n\"They need to show results on this next quarterly report.\"\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate— Get Institutional Access Yourself\nThe market expert told Benzinga that Meta stock \"has more downside risk.\"\nWoods also sees some risk for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ) shares heading into 2026.\n\"Microsoft is another one. Topping formation developing there and it's got me a little concerned.\"\nThe market expert said that $475 is the level to watch and if Microsoft breaks below that level, there could be a \"significant leg lower.\"\n\nWoods also told Benzinga that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is a stock to watch for underperformance in 2026 among the Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\"Nvidia will have a good year. I just don't know if we're going to see that explosive growth to the upside from a stock performance point of view.\"\nIn his weekly newsletter , Woods recently predicted that semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia could stall in 2026 and take a step back. Woods told Benzinga that while it’s not a Magnificent Seven stock, he prefers Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU ) to Nvidia in 2026.\n\nNot making the cut for favorite or least favorite Magnificent 7 stocks by Woods were Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ).\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "This Dividend-Yielding Tech Stock Looks a ‘Compelling Buy’ for 2026 After 2 Years of Underperformance\n\nMohit Oberoi\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:30 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nWith year-to-date (YTD) gains of just about 15%, Microsoft (MSFT) is underperforming both the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX). The Satya Nadella-led company underperformed last year as well, and its gains of 12% in 2024 paled in comparison to its tech peers as well as the broader markets.\nIncidentally, the “Magnificent 7,” which led the market rally from the front in 2023 and 2024, did not have the best of years, and none of them made it to the list of top 20 gainers in the S&P 500 Index in 2025. The group’s collective price action has been below par, and only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are outperforming their average S&P 500 Index peer by a noticeable margin. Meanwhile, after the 2025 underperformance, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities—a known perma tech bull—sees MSFT stock rising to $625 next year and termed it a “compelling buy.” Notably, while tech stocks aren’t really known for their dividends and many don’t pay one in the first place, Microsoft’s dividend yield of 0.75% is the highest among Magnificent 7 stocks. It is on the verge of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nThis Dividend Stock Just Scored an FDA Win.

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWhy Did Microsoft Underperform in 2025? Microsoft’s 2025 underperformance has largely been due to concerns over its burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) capex. The company, which previously said that its capex growth would fall in the fiscal year 2026, now sees it going up instead. The Windows parent splurged almost $35 billion towards capex in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which ended in September, a record for the company.\n\nTo be sure, rising AI capex is not a Microsoft thing, and Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet have also bumped up spending amid the AI arms race. Barring Alphabet, which entered 2025 with tepid expectations and ended up impressing with its financial performance, the other three are underperforming this year. I find an Alphabet connection to Microsoft’s underperformance. While Gemini gaining ground at OpenAI’s cost helped propel GOOG stock higher, it put pressure on Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s biggest investor and a proxy play on the world’s most valuable unlisted startup.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft Stock's 2026 Forecast Despite the 2025 underperformance, the analyst community is not giving up on Microsoft, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 48 analysts polled by Barchart . MSFT stock trades even below the Street-low target price of $490, while the mean target price of $629.23 is almost 30% higher than current price levels.\n\nNotably, Ives’ target price of $625 is similar to the consensus price target and the same as Wolfe Research, which lowered MSFT’s target price by $50 earlier this month. Looking at the recent action, DA Davidson and Jefferies maintained their bullish bets on Microsoft this month while maintaining their respective target prices of $675 and $650.\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy for 2026? I remain constructive on MSFT stock heading into 2026. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30.6x, which I find balanced. The P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiples do look a bit ugly at 1.82x, but that’s got to do with AI capex hitting the company’s profits in the form of higher capex. “Big Short” Michael Burry’s controversial views on tech companies’ inflating the useful life of AI chips notwithstanding, companies like Microsoft are set to face higher depreciation expenses over the next couple of years.\n\nThere is a lot to like about Microsoft at these levels, though. The stock is a defensive play with a well-diversified business. The company’s Windows and Office business would continue to benefit from the uptick in PC sales, led by an aging base of installed devices and the advent of AI PCs. The ending of Windows 10 support would also help keep that segment buoyed, as more users would feel urged to upgrade to Windows 11.\nMoreover, AI is fueling demand for subscriptions, which would add to Microsoft’s topline. The cloud business is particularly growing at a brisk pace, and Microsoft is closing the gap with market leader Amazon. Specifically, during their recent earnings call, Microsoft said that its commercial cloud remaining performance obligations (RPO) soared 50% to $400 billion at the end of September, with a weighted average duration of just two years.\nOverall, while I haven’t been a permabull on MSFT, I have used the dips to add to my positions, something I repeated this time around as well. At these levels, I find MSFT stock a decent buy and see it delivering double-digit returns next year.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: MSFT, GOOG, NVDA, AMZN, META.

      "Content": "Nvidia, joining Big Tech deal spree, to license Groq technology, hire executives\n\nStephen Nellis\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GROQ.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nCESY.PVT\n\nBy Stephen Nellis\nDec 24 (Reuters) - Nvidia has agreed to license chip technology from startup Groq and hire away its CEO, a veteran of Alphabet's Google, Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday.\nThe deal follows a familiar pattern ​in recent years where the world's biggest technology firms pay large sums in deals with promising startups to take their ‌technology and talent but stop short of formally acquiring the target.\n\nGroq specializes in what is known as inference, where artificial intelligence models that have already been trained respond ‌to requests from users. While Nvidia dominates the market for training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\nNvidia has agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology, Groq said. It said its founder Jonathan Ross, who helped Google start its AI chip program, as well as Groq ⁠President Sunny Madra and other members of its ‌engineering team, will join Nvidia.\nA person close to Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither ‍Nvidia nor Groq commented on the report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\n\nIn similar recent deals, Microsoft 's top AI executive came through a $650 million deal with a startup that ​was billed as a licensing fee, and Meta spent $15 billion to hire Scale AI's CEO without acquiring the entire firm.

While Nvidia dominates the market for ‌training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\n\nGroq said that Nvidia had agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology. Groq said that its founder ⁠Jonathan Ross, who helped Google ‌start its AI chip program, as well as Groq President Sunny Madra and other members of its engineering team will join Nvidia.\nA person close to ‍Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC earlier reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither Nvidia nor Groq commented on the ​report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an ‌independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\nGroq more than doubled its valuation to $6.9 billion, from $2.8 billion in August last year, following a $750 million funding round in September.\n\nGroq is one of a number of upstarts that do not use external high-bandwidth memory chips, which free them from the memory crunch affecting the global chip industry.

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The outage on Dec. 20, which cut electricity to nearly one-third of the city, was caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas and Electric Company substation and led to widespread traffic congestion as signals went dark across large parts of the city.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AMD.\nIs GOOG fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nWaymo said it will roll out fleetwide updates designed to help vehicles better navigate large-scale outages, alongside expanded engagement with first responders and updates to its emergency response protocols. While the driver system already treats dark traffic lights as four-way stops, it can request confirmation checks to ensure it is making the safest decision. During the outage, Waymo said a concentrated spike in these requests created backlogs and response delays, even though its vehicles handled more than 7,000 dark traffic signals.\nThe company said these confirmation protocols were put in place early in its deployment out of caution and were effective during smaller outages. By giving the system specific power-outage context, Waymo said the new updates could allow its vehicles to operate more decisively in similar situations going forward, a step that could be viewed by investors as part of Alphabet's effort to improve reliability as autonomous operations expand in dense urban environments.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Should You Buy AAPL Stock First?\n\nLarry Ramer\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 9:09 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nDan Ives, a well-respected tech analyst for investment bank Wedbush, recently predicted that a “formal,” AI-oriented alliance between Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) would be announced in 2026 and enable AAPL’s market capitalization to reach $5 trillion next year, versus its current level of slightly over $4 trillion.\n\nWhile such a formal partnership could very well be unveiled in 2026, evidence strongly indicates that the alliance would not come close to boosting Apple’s market capitalization by nearly 25%. Indeed, it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which a formal partnership between AAPL and GOOG would boost AAPL stock much at all. As a result, I would not recommend that investors buy the company’s shares based on Ives’ prediction.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\n$800 for Tesla Stock Could Be Reality in 2026. Here’s Why.\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nAbout AAPL Stock Primarily due to the iPhone’s popularity and its high gross margins, Apple is one of the most profitable companies in the world. In the 12 months that ended in September, it generated income of $112 billion. Consequently, its market capitalization, which stands at about $4.04 trillion, is huge.\nOn the other hand, AAPL stock has lagged many of its Big Tech peers in recent years. In the last 12 months, the shares are up only about 7%, while they have gained 42% in the last two years. Conversely, GOOG, for example, has jumped about 60% in the last year and roughly 121% in the last two years.\nOne issue weighing on AAPL stock is the company’s inability so far to generate a great deal of revenue from the AI revolution.\nAAPL’s top line increased 8% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $102.5 billion, and it has a trailing price-earnings ratio of 36.3 times.\nWhy a Potential Partnership With GOOG Probably Won’t Move the Needle Much for AAPL Stock Ives indicated that AAPL’s market capitalization would be lifted by almost 25% by charging subscription fees for its AI offering. But Microsoft’s (MSFT) experience with its AI assistant, CoPilot, for which it charges some users subscription fees, strongly indicates that Ives’ vision is unrealistic. Specifically, in a post updated last month, Business of Apps reported that “Microsoft Copilot had 33 million active users across Windows, app and website.” Moreover, the website believes that MSFT’s entire AI business generated “about $400 million direct revenue in 2024.”\n\nStory Continues\nEvery CoPilot user does not pay subscription fees. But even if we assume that Apple was able to quickly obtain as many users as CoPilot has and they all paid a $10 per month fee, the resulting revenue would not move the needle for AAPL stock. Under the latter scenario, AAPL would generate slightly under $4 billion of annual revenue from the offering, versus its total revenue for its last fiscal year of $416.16 billion.\n\nAdditionally, as I pointed out in my previous column, “under (Apple CEO Tim) Cook, the results of substantially all the firm’s efforts at innovation, from its efforts to develop a car to Apple TV to AI, have been rather underwhelming.” The latter historical fact also makes me very doubtful about Apple’s ability to turn its AI offering into a huge needle mover of AAPL stock.\nAdditionally, I noted that \"Apple bulls, since at least August 2024, have predicted that the advent of AI would spark “a major upgrade cycle for the iPhone,” but this scenario has not yet materialized. Finally, analysts on average predict that the firm’s revenue will increase by 8.7% during its current fiscal year that ends in September, indicating that most do not expect such a cycle to materialize in 2026.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The event shows how hard it is for self driving cars to get from controlled testing to driving in real cities.Waymo is still a long-term investment on self-driving cars for Alphabet. Investors will be keeping a careful eye on how the business improves the technology and deals with problems in the real world as robotaxi services grow.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump’s $100,000 H-1B Visa Application Fee Upheld by Judge\n\nMadlin Mekelburg\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:18 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTCS.BO\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge said the Trump administration can move ahead with a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, providing a setback for US technology companies that rely on hiring skilled foreign workers.\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell said in a ruling Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s effort to radically increase the cost of the popular visa is lawful. The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Quantum computing is the stock market’s next big tech play — and these stocks are still cheap\n\nCharlie Garcia\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:03 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nLet me tell you something that should keep you up tonight.\nSomewhere in a Google lab, a chip called just computed the structure of a molecule 13,000 times faster than the most powerful supercomputer on Earth. The scientists who built it believe that within five years, quantum computers like this will solve problems that are currently impossible. Not difficult.

Will I get punished on taxes?\n\nSomewhere in Beijing, Chinese researchers are working on the same thing. They have a trillion yuan in backing and no shareholders asking about quarterly earnings.\nAnd somewhere, probably on your couch, you’re checking your index funds and wondering why this article is trying to scare you.\nHere’s why: The first nation to achieve quantum supremacy doesn’t just win a science prize. It wins the ability to break every encryption system protecting every bank, every military secret and every private message you’ve ever sent.\nThe experts have a name for that day. They call it Q-Day , which sounds like something from a movie you’d watch on an airplane, except this one is real and nobody knows exactly when it will arrive.\nThe tech nerds are high-fiving in Silicon Valley. The generals are briefing Congress. And most investors haven’t noticed.\n\nYou’re about to.\nAs Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parent Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, recently d, quantum today is where AI was five years ago: poised to make a small number of people obscenely wealthy.\nWhat qubits do that regular computers can’t Classical computers operate on binary bits. Ones and zeros. Yes or no. Like a very fast, very stupid employee who can only answer true-or-false questions.\nQuantum computers use qubits, which exploit something called “superposition” to exist in multiple states simultaneously. Problems that would take classical supercomputers longer than the age of the universe to solve suddenly become Tuesday afternoon’s work.\n\nThis includes drug discovery, materials science, logistics optimization and breaking every password ever created. That last application has attracted the keen interest of the Pentagon . When the U.S. Department of Defense compares quantum supremacy to aircraft carriers and sees it as a decisive factor in warfare, even the most committed pacifist should consider repositioning his portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nA trillion yuan buys a lot of physicists John Martinis, the winner of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics, recently that China is “nanoseconds” behind in the quantum race.\nLet me translate from physicist to English: We’re in a dead heat with a country that has declared its intention to become the global leader in quantum-information science, already dominates quantum communications, and just unveiled a one-trillion-yuan fund to boost “hard technologies.”\n\nThat’s $140 billion. It’s not a research grant, but a declaration of intent.\nThe first nation to develop a quantum computer capable of breaking classical cryptography will possess capabilities that make current cybersecurity look like a screen door on a submarine. Every encrypted communication, every financial transaction, every military secret becomes readable.\nThe U.S. government has noticed. DARPA’s just advanced 11 companies to Stage B evaluation, the broadest and most technologically diverse cohort they’ve ever assessed. The Pentagon has elevated quantum to the center of its future weapons strategy. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission is Congress to adopt a “Quantum First” national goal by 2030.\nWhen Congress agrees on anything, take note.\n\nWhy quantum is now an investment, not a theory Here’s the investment case in plain English: The science works. The question now is manufacturing.\nQuantum computing requires its own industrial revolution. It needs wafer-scale cryogenic integration, high-yield fabrication and architectures designed not for academic elegance but for factory floors.\nThis is good news for investors. Physics breakthroughs are unpredictable. Engineering problems can be solved with sufficient money and motivation. The U.S. has both.\n\nGoogle’s Willow chip matters not because of what it computes, but because of how it’s made — using industrial-grade fabrication that looks more like semiconductor manufacturing than a bespoke physics experiment. This is the template. This is how scientific curiosity becomes a transformational industry.\nMeanwhile, AI is accelerating quantum development while quantum accelerates AI. In February, released a model that sped up catalyst discovery for clean energy by 20,000x versus traditional methods. IONQ claims its quantum computers solve certain problems using less than 1% of the power consumption of classical supercomputers.\nThese are not incremental improvements. These are the numbers that launch industries.\nAn ETF and stocks to consider The honest investment columnist admits he doesn’t know which horse will win. He merely observes there’s a race, points out the horses that haven’t collapsed, and suggests betting on the field might be wiser than picking the champion.\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF QTUM provides broad exposure and trades at roughly 23 times cash flow. Not cheap, but not insane for a sector where winners might return 50 times. It’s up almost 40% so far this year, which either means you missed the easy money or the market has correctly identified something important.\n\nQuantinuum, majority-owned by Honeywell International HON, shows genuine technical promise. The company’s trapped-ion approach achieves a roughly 2:1 physical-to-logical qubit ratio. Most architectures need hundreds of physical qubits to create one error-corrected logical qubit. Quantinuum does it with two. This efficiency improvement turns “theoretically possible” into “commercially viable.”\nHoneywell shares are down this year, partly because it’s splitting into aerospace and automation divisions — and the market hates complexity. But Honeywell’s quantum exposure through Quantinuum may be undervalued precisely because nobody thinks of Honeywell as a quantum play. They think of thermostats.\nIonQ advanced to Stage B of DARPA’s initiative — meaning serious people with security clearances believe the company’s technology merits serious evaluation. Its trapped-ion architecture operates at room temperature, a meaningful advantage when competitors require cooling systems that make Antarctica look balmy. The stock is up this year but suffered a brutal correction from its October highs.\n\nHitachi JP:6501 is the quiet horse. While Americans argued about whether quantum was real, the Japanese were building it. Hitachi’s quantum initiatives span silicon-based hardware, optimization systems and quantum-safe encryption. The Tokyo-traded shares are up about 27% this year. That’s what happens when you do useful work while everyone else issues press releases.\nEverything that could go wrong (A partial list) Quantum stocks have been volatile enough to concern shareholders’ cardiologists. IonQ shares, for example, nearly tripled from January through mid-October — then lost a third of its value in two months. These are not investments for people who check portfolios daily.\nThe technology still faces challenges. Error correction at scale remains unsolved. Most quantum computers require temperatures colder than in outer space. The talent pool is approximately the size of a faculty meeting at MIT’s physics department.\n\nAnd the eventual winners here might not be publicly traded yet. Betting on quantum in 2025 resembles betting on automobiles in 1905. Henry Ford had yet to introduce the Model T. Most promising companies from that era no longer exist.\nBut someone was going to build cars. Someone is going to build quantum computers.\nMore: These Big Tech stocks are the smart way to invest in the quantum-computing boom\nWhat a prudent investor does now Quantum computing is transitioning from a science experiment to a strategic asset. The physics works. The engineering is progressing. Government and private money are flowing in quantities that would make a Gilded Age robber baron blush.\nThe prudent investor allocates a small portion of his portfolio to quantum exposure, accepts that volatility is the price of admission, and recognizes that long-term trajectory matters more than monthly price swings.\n\nThe imprudent investor ignores quantum entirely, on the theory that things he doesn’t understand can’t possibly matter. History has not been kind to that theory.\nHe has no position in any of the companies or investments mentioned in this article.\n\nMore from Charlie Garcia:\nChina is quietly destroying the dollar — and that’ll cost you.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI revenues surged 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. XPU adoption accelerated in the reported quarter as enterprises continue to use these to train their large language models and monetize their platforms through inference APIs and applications. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are major users of these XPUs.\n\nAVGO’s expanding clientele, which now includes Anthropic, is driving growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received a $10 billion order to sell Alphabet’s latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received an additional order worth $11 billion from the same customer. The company’s current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as AVGO’s latest 102-terabit per second Tomahawk 6 switch continues to gain traction. AVGO now expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 AI revenues to double year over year to $8.2 billion.\n\nAVGO’s networking portfolio is gaining from strong demand for Tomahawk 6 products, as well as the Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router. Broadcom also has a rich partner base that includes the likes of OpenAI, Walmart, NVIDIA, Canonical, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, among others. AVGO expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 Semiconductor revenues of $12.3 billion, suggesting 50% year-over-year growth. Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to grow 2% year over year to $6.8 billion.\n\nAVGO Faces Tough Competition in the Semiconductor Market Broadcom is a major player in the semiconductor market, but is facing stiff competition from NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for Gen AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues from Data Center (accounted for 89.8% of NVDA revenues) jumped 66% year over year and 25% sequentially to $51.22 billion.\n\nMarvell Technology is benefiting from the strong demand environment across the data center end market. MRVL’s data center end-market revenues jumped 39% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, propelled by strong growth across AI-driven demand for custom XPU silicon and electro-optics interconnect products. Marvell Technology’s AI-driven custom silicon business has secured more than 20 multi-generational XPU and XPU-attach socket wins. MRVL’s design pipeline has expanded to more than 50 opportunities worth $75 billion, underscoring hyperscalers’ growing reliance on Marvell’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nStory Continues\nAVGO’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Broadcom shares have appreciated 45.7% in a year, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nAVGO Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe AVGO stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/earnings of 33.89X compared with the broader sector’s 27.78X.

In the trailing nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Google Cloud revenues jumped 31.2% over the same year-ago time frame to $41.04 billion. The top line benefited from growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core products, AI Infrastructure and generative AI (Gen AI) Solutions. Cloud backlog jumped 46% sequentially to $155 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2025. The AI and security push is expected to boost Google Cloud’s prospects in the near term.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding AI infrastructure is helping Alphabet win enterprise clients. GCP’s prospects remain robust, driven by strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs (led by seventh-generation Ironwood) and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for the latest Gemini and other AI models, and other services, including cybersecurity and data analytics. Google Cloud is also benefiting from strong Gen AI adoption due to leading models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues from products developed on Google’s Gen AI models surged more than 200% year over year.\n\nSecurity push is expected to drive Google Cloud’s top-line growth further. The addition of Wiz (acquisition pending, expected to complete in 2026) to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT in the cloud computing space. The latest collaboration between Google Cloud and Palo Alto Networks combines Google Cloud’s AI and infrastructure capabilities with Prisma AIRS, the latter’s comprehensive AI security platform. Accelerating investments bodes well for GOOGL’s prospects. Alphabet expects capital expenditure between $91 billion and $93 billion for 2025, which is anticipated to increase further in 2026.\n\nGOOGL Faces Tough Competition in Cloud Domain Per Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 29% in the third quarter of 2025, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 20% and Google Cloud at 13%.\n\nAmazon is spending heavily on fortifying its Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure that supports AI workloads and expanded data center capacity. Amazon committed $125 billion in capital expenditure for 2025, with the vast majority directed toward AWS infrastructure. The third quarter alone saw $34.2 billion in cash capex, while the company added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity over 12 months, the largest expansion in cloud history.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft Azure and other cloud services revenues accelerated 40% in constant currency (cc), with management attributing significant contributions to AI-related demand. Microsoft Cloud revenues reached $49.1 billion, increasing 25% in cc and reflecting strong enterprise adoption of cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities. Spending is expected to accelerate throughout fiscal 2026, with roughly half to be spent on GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand and AI workload expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Alphabet shares have appreciated 60.5% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nGOOGL Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe GOOGL stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 9.67X compared with the broader sector’s 6.55X.
