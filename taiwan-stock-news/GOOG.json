Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nDebitMyData Lays the Foundation for the Human Energy Grid: Preparing the Workforce for the AI Economy and Unlocking a Compliant Future for Data Center Expansion\n\nDebit My Data, Inc.\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 11:43 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nDebitMyData Human Energy Grid\n\nDebitMyData Custom Logo and Facial Recognition DebitMyData™ Logo\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Dec. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As AI accelerates beyond human employment capacity and public trust erodes under massive data center expansion, DebitMyData, Inc. is building the missing bridge — the human and digital foundation for the next economy.\nBefore governments acted, before the Genesis Executive Order ignited a national push for ethical AI infrastructure, DebitMyData was already designing the architecture that would realign labor, data, and energy into a unified human-first ecosystem.\n\nDebitMyData.com is the first layer of that ecosystem: a strategic platform preparing today’s workforce for the Creator Economy, where displaced workers regain agency through verified digital identity, direct data monetization, and participation in the coming Human Energy Grid — the trust and compliance layer that will enable hyperscalers like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft to expand ethically and transparently. Watch: DebitMyData Human Energy Grid .\nThe Crisis: Billions Spent, Projects Stalled\nSince 2022, the world’s largest AI companies have pledged more than $200 billion to build data centers powering generative intelligence. Yet projects remain paralyzed across multiple jurisdictions — halted by community opposition, regulatory confusion, and growing fears that “AI progress” benefits only corporations, not citizens.\n\nDebitMyData’s solution reframes the equation.\nBy valuing human participation in data exchange, energy contribution, and consent verification, the Human Energy Grid introduces an economic model where infrastructure growth yields tangible local and individual benefits — aligning corporate expansion with community trust.\n“Before the Genesis Order, we already understood the next frontier,” said Preska Thomas,, Founder and CEO of DebitMyData, Inc. “The challenge isn’t building more compute — it’s building more trust. Without societal consent and economic inclusion, the AI revolution can’t scale sustainably.”\nPhase One: Building the Workforce Trust Layer\nDebitMyData.com serves as the activation point. Through it, the company is organizing and credentialing a next-generation digital workforce — those displaced or at risk from AI automation — into the coming grid economy.\n\nParticipants gain:\nVerified Digital Identities (DID): Anchored in secure, LLM-backed protocols enabling individuals to control, monetize, and consent to their data usage. Watch: DebitMyData Custom Logo and Facial Recognition .\nCreator Economy Readiness:Training and compensation models that align with the future AI-driven labor ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nCollective Grid Participation: Future integration into the Human Energy Grid, where digital identity links directly to energy, compute, and compensation systems.\nThis workforce mobilization positions DebitMyData as not just a technology platform, but a human readiness layer—the connective tissue between displaced labor and infrastructure modernization.\n\nPhase Two: Partnering for Ethical Infrastructure\nAs DebitMyData expands the DID and labor participation network, the company is laying the groundwork for the Human Energy Grid, a compliance-ready trust layer for data centers and AI infrastructure providers.\nFor technology giants and developers facing mounting public resistance, Human Energy Grid provides the missing compliance bridge:\nCommunity Consent Intelligence: Blockchain-backed verification that satisfies local governance and environmental mandates.\nPublic Benefit Integration: Energy, water, and data transparency mechanisms that turn traditional opposition into shared prosperity.\nRapid Onboarding:\nDebitMyData’s API and DID infrastructure retrofit easily with existing energy, cloud, and AI systems—no rip-and-replace required.\n\nWe’re creating the social infrastructure that lets hyperscalers build compliantly, governments verify trust transparently, and citizens profit directly from the AI age,” said Founder Preska Thomas. This isn’t just technology—it’s economic realignment.”\nThe Path Forward\nDebitMyData is not waiting for AI to displace millions before responding. It is architecting the response mechanism itself: a data economy that rewards human contribution as much as computational horsepower.\nFor workers,it’s a new revenue channel and pathway back into participation.\nFor governments,it’s a verifiable consent framework.\nFor investors, it’s the foundation of the world’s most scalable ethical infrastructure.\nFor hyperscalers, it’s the bridge from resistance to readiness.\n\nAbout DebitMyData, Inc.\nDebitMyData, Inc. is a U.S.-based technology company building the intersection of AI, energy, and human participation. Its ecosystem—anchored by DebitMyData.com and the forthcoming Human Energy Grid —creates a blueprint for ethical AI expansion, enabling communities, companies, and governments to scale intelligence with trust.\nRegistered with the U.S. government’s SAM system and assigned an official CAGE number, DebitMyData is eligible for federal infrastructure, cybersecurity, and AI trust contracts under the Genesis initiative.\nPress & Partnerships :\nMedia Direct Line: +1-754-315-2420\nEmail press@debitmydata.com\nWebsite: www.debitmydata.com\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/14664b9f-4b0e-40e2-9430-7ff648c8e588\nVideos accompanying this announcement are available at:\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5445850e-9a29-4229-a358-bf2f77778292\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/30effb7b-3512-4ef7-844e-caa2cf59b075\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Have $2,000? 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for at Least a Decade.\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:50 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nSOUN\n\nAMPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's growing AI ecosystem creates compelling growth tailwinds for this quality business.\nSoundHound's voice and conversational AI solutions have caught the attention of major clients.\nAmplitude's AI agents and other tools are building a high-revenue-growth business.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) revolution contains a wealth of investment opportunities, not to mention the potential for massive economic transformation and productivity enhancements. Companies ranging from small start-ups to the world's largest corporate giants are investing heavily in AI research and infrastructure in a bid to keep up in the global technology race.\nThis strong institutional support is expected to accelerate development and adoption and create a favorable and stable environment for AI-focused businesses over the long run. While not all AI stocks will be winners, focusing on quality companies with robust competitive advantages and strong financial foundations can allow you to capitalize on the future of this industry in its still relatively nascent stages.\nOn that note, if you have $2,000 to invest, here are three AI stocks to buy and hold for at least a decade.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) full-stack AI ecosystem, vast data moat, dominant market positions in search and cloud, and substantial financial strength continue to pose enviable tailwinds for this behemoth business. Alphabet boasts end-to-end AI infrastructure, including its in-house AI chips (Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs), the Gemini foundational models, the Google Cloud platform, and a massive array of user-facing products, including Search, YouTube, and Android.\n\nTPUs are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed specifically for neural network math, which makes them efficient for AI training and inference, unlike more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Not only are TPUs the backbone of Google's AI, running core products like Google Search and training massive models like Gemini, but they also provide notable cost savings and boost internal performance.\nBy developing its own silicon, Alphabet is able to decouple from external chip supply chains and pricing to achieve greater control and scale for AI development. Google Cloud now offers TPUs as a service, which also positions Alphabet as a major force in the lucrative AI hardware market beyond just being a consumer of chips.\n\nUser interaction data from Search and YouTube is used to train and refine AI models, providing another durable competitive advantage for the broader business ecosystem. Importantly, AI is boosting Google Search traffic and optimizing ad placements. Search is the company's core cash engine and still represents more than half of the company's overall revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle is the default search engine on most devices, which gives Alphabet a vast distribution network to deploy and refine new AI features. Other ventures, like Waymo (autonomous driving) and AI-powered healthcare research through its subsidiary Verily, are more nascent sources of long-term growth potential and demonstrate Alphabet's commitment to AI innovation.\n\nAlphabet remains consistently profitable (net income increased 33% in the third quarter alone) and generates significant cash flow, which it habitually invests in AI infrastructure, data centers, and research. The company remains a compelling and stalwart play in the AI space that long-term investors can buy, hold, and add to for years to come.\n2. SoundHound SoundHound (NASDAQ: SOUN) specializes in developing and providing independent voice and conversational artificial intelligence solutions for businesses across various industries. This enables companies to integrate customized, natural-sounding voice assistants into their products, services, and apps. Instead of a two-step process of transcribing speech to text and then processing it, SoundHound's technology understands both speech and intent in one step, allowing for faster and more accurate responses.\n\nThese solutions are used in multiple sectors. SoundHound has moved beyond its initial focus on the automotive sector (e.g., its partnership with Stellantis ) into areas such as restaurants (e.g., Chipotle Mexican Grill , Five Guys, White Castle, Jersey Mike's) to reduce its dependency on any single customer. For example, restaurants utilize SoundHound's platform to automate phone and drive-thru orders, manage complex menu modifications, and address customer inquiries about business hours.\nSoundHound also provides AI agents for customer service in various industries, including healthcare, financial services, and insurance. The company generates revenue through subscription fees for its software solutions, commissions from voice-enabled commerce interactions, and by licensing its technology to partners.\n\nSoundHound's Q3 2025 revenue of $42 million represented a 68% increase from a year ago. However, SoundHound has never posted an annual profit, continues to report substantial GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net losses, and its core operations are still bleeding cash. That's why the stock has been hit so hard of late.\nStill, SoundHound's collaborations with major brands and the acquisition of companies like Amelia (an enterprise agentic AI platform) and Interactions (a customer service AI platform) have strengthened its market position, expanded its customer base, and added new capabilities that could prove to be generous growth tailwinds. SoundHound reported a significant contractual backlog of approximately $1.2 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAnd unlike big tech competitors ( Amazon , Google, and Apple ) whose voice AI solutions are tied to their ecosystems, SoundHound offers white-label, customizable solutions that allow businesses to maintain full brand control and data privacy and provide a key selling point for these enterprises. If you believe in that value proposition and have the risk tolerance to invest in a more pure-play, AI-driven business, SoundHound could be worth considering for at least a small position over the next decade.\n3. Amplitude Amplitude (NASDAQ: AMPL) is a digital analytics platform that helps businesses understand how customers use their digital products to improve user experiences and drive revenue growth. The company has fully embraced AI by launching a suite of AI agents and features that automate data analysis and generate actionable insights for customers.\n\nAmplitude's AI agents are autonomous AI tools that monitor user behavior, detect issues (like falling conversion rates), form hypotheses, and suggest or even implement optimizations for things like checkout flow or feature adoption. Its AI feedback solution is an AI-native tool that synthesizes customer feedback from various sources (e.g., calls, reviews, tickets) to instantly develop themes, connect them to user behavior, and help companies build better features.\nAfter some post-pandemic headwinds, Amplitude's growth has started to accelerate again, with recent quarters showing solid increases in revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR). Amplitude reported excellent Q3 2025 results, with ARR of $347 million, up 16% year over year, and remaining performance obligations (RPO) of $391.9 million, up 37% year over year.\n\nAmplitude's business model is a freemium tiered software-as-a-service framework centered on product analytics. It employs a land-and-expand strategy, where it acquires customers through a robust free tier and scales revenue as they grow and adopt more advanced platform capabilities. Companies across various industries, including prominent names such as Walmart , Atlassian , and Shopify, as well as growth-stage disruptors like DoorDash and Coinbase , utilize Amplitude to gain insights into their users' behavior and enhance their digital products.\nThe company has a diverse base of over 4,500 customers and a growing number of large enterprise customers. Its cohort of customers with $100,000 or more in ARR rose 15% year over year in Q3. Overall revenue grew 18% year over year in Q3 2025.\n\nWhile still posting a GAAP net loss, Amplitude is cash-flow positive and expects to achieve non-GAAP operating income for the full year 2025. It generated free cash flow of $3.4 million in Q3. If the company's AI platform continues to gain headway, this business could have a significant role to play in the evolving AI revolution. That's a value proposition that some long-term investors might want to capitalize on.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nMSFT\n\nTSM\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is a leader in e-commerce and fintech.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are making waves with their respective AI innovations.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the top chip manufacturer in the world.\n10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre ›\nInvesting for the long term requires a disciplined and resilient mindset to navigate the inherent volatility of the stock market. Managing the psychology behind your investment decisions is as crucial as selecting the right investments.\n\nThe market price of a stock is often driven by short-term emotions and news, while its true value is tied to the underlying company's long-term earning power and assets. A strong mindset allows you to view temporary price drops as potential buying opportunities for quality assets, not reasons to panic.\nLikewise, if you're focused on the long-term picture, you can select quality businesses with robust fundamentals that make sense as part of your portfolio without being swayed by short-term market volatility. If you have cash to invest in the stock market right now, here are four stocks to consider buying and holding for at least five years.\n1. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the clear e-commerce leader across over a dozen countries in Latin America, including major markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. It has a significant competitive advantage over global players like Amazon due to its established presence, brand recognition, and deep understanding of local market needs.\n\nThe company operates a vast tech ecosystem, including its e-commerce marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, which is powered by its integrated fintech arm Mercado Pago, its robust logistics business Mercado Envíos, and advertising services. It's worth noting that Mercado Pago has grown into a full digital financial services platform (e.g., payments, credit, savings, investments) that serves the region's large unbanked population and has created a sticky user base with high monetization potential.\nThe company is consistently profitable and boasts impressive growth metrics. In Q3 2025, it reported a 39% year-over-year revenue increase. Total net revenue reached $7.4 billion. Total payment volume reached $71 billion, up 41% year over year, and gross merchandise volume rose to $16.5 billion, a 28% year-over-year spike.\n\nRobust e-commerce performance in core markets like Brazil and Mexico bolstered MercadoLibre's quarterly performance. And, the number of successful items sold grew by 39% year over year to 635 million. If you want to invest in an e-commerce and fintech giant operating outside the U.S., MercadoLibre is a profitable and compelling leader to consider.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) managed to effectively monetize generative AI faster than most peers by integrating it across its entire tech stack. AI services accounted for roughly 15 percentage points of the total Azure revenue growth in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026. Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, which has created a high-margin recurring revenue stream.\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI capacity, and its capital expenditures have exceeded $30 billion per quarter to meet surging demand. Azure remains a primary catalyst for the business's long-term value and consistently delivers high growth even on a massive revenue base. For the full fiscal year 2025, Microsoft's annual revenue surpassed $281 billion, growing by 15% from the prior year. Azure revenue was more than $75 billion, a 34% increase year over year. Azure holds approximately 20% of the global cloud market.\nMicrosoft maintains one of the strongest balance sheets in the corporate world, which supports its consistent returns to investors. It's one of only two U.S. companies with a perfect AAA credit rating (that's higher than the U.S. government). The company generated over $100 billion in net income in fiscal 2025, so it continues to have massive flexibility for R&D and acquisitions.\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years and regularly repurchases billions in stock (it returned almost $11 billion to shareholders in the most recent quarter alone through dividends and share repurchases). Management and analysts have set ambitious targets for the next five years. CEO Satya Nadella aims to exceed $500 billion in annual revenue by 2030, nearly double its current scale.\n3. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is deeply integrating powerful AI models like Gemini across its massive ecosystem (e.g, Search, YouTube, Cloud). AI improves its search relevance, makes YouTube more engaging, and personalizes user experiences, which in turn can drive better engagement and more ad dollars. Instead of cannibalizing search, Alphabet's new tools like AI summaries are increasing ad impressions and conversions, and expanding its commercial pathways in search.\n\nAlphabet is also leveraging its custom TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) semiconductor chips to compete in cloud infrastructure. While historically the company had reserved most TPUs for in-house use and cloud services, it has recently begun selling some directly to third parties in specific bilateral deals. These include major AI clients like Anthropic as Alphabet creates a new high-margin revenue stream.\nAlphabet's TPUs are revolutionary, particularly because they are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) purpose-built for the core mathematical operations of deep learning applications. This specialized design provides significant advantages in performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness at scale compared to the more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Revenue from TPUs is a key driver of the overall Google Cloud segment's growth, which generated robust Q3 2025 revenue of $15.2 billion, a 34% year-over-year increase.\n\nAnalysts from firms like Morgan Stanley project that expanded external sales could add billions in new revenue to Alphabet's top line in the coming years (an estimated $13 billion for every 500,000 units sold by 2027). AI could also unlock opportunities in robotics (Waymo), healthcare, and enterprise solutions outside of Alphabet's traditional advertising and cloud businesses. Alphabet's strong balance sheet with substantial cash and low debt, and a generous history of providing enviable returns to shareholders, are icing on the cake for long-term investors in this storied business.\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) or TSMC is the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing and controls roughly 70% of the global foundry market. Unlike investing in a single chip designer, holding TSMC can allow investors to profit regardless of who wins the AI race. And the reality is that there will likely be many winners as the AI revolution heats up.\n\nThe demand for AI computing power is soaring, and only a few companies possess the capabilities to design the required chips. All major AI players -- including Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom -- rely on TSMC to build their most advanced chips. The company produces at least 90% of the world's most advanced chips, which has created a massive technological moat that competitors like Intel and Samsung are currently struggling to bridge.\nManagement expects AI-related revenue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. TSMC had a very strong Q3 2025 financially and beat expectations with both record profits and revenue. Substantial and growing demand for AI chips and high-performance computing (HPC) drove revenue up over 30% year over year. Net income surged 40% year over year, and TSMC's gross margin improved to 59.5%.\n\nTSMC is aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of Taiwan. The company has committed $165 billion to build six advanced fabs in Arizona, with the first already being in volume production. Additional major investments are underway in Japan and Germany, and management aims to have 30% of its most advanced capacity located outside Taiwan by 2028. Shares are up about 40% year to date, and it may be wise to scoop some up before the business soars higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?

It's best known for its expensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), but it's increasingly focused on vertically integrated products that draw high-paying clients into its ecosystem.\n\nThese companies are spending vast amounts of money on their AI development using Nvidia products, creating high barriers to entry for other vendors. That gives Nvidia an edge on top of the one it already has from having the most powerful program.\nHowever, there are other top companies, including Amazon and Alphabet , that are creating their own AI chips and finding the white space to drive AI.\nWhat seems likely is that Nvidia will keep launching new and improved technology and keep its lead, but as competition heats up, the landscape continues to change, and the company gets bigger, growth will decelerate. The price is already coming down to a more realistic valuation , and it could still beat the market next year, but it isn't likely to deliver the life-changing gains it has in the past.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Peter Thiel and Larry Page are preparing to flee California in case the state passes a billionaire wealth tax, report says\n\nJason Ma\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 12:38 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTech billionaires are making plans to bail on California ahead a possible ballot measure that would tax their assets to help pay for healthcare.\nSources told the New York Times that venture capitalist Peter Thiel has explored spending more time outside California and opening an office for his Los Angeles-based personal investment firm, Thiel Capital, in another state.\n\nMeanwhile, Google cofounder Larry Page has discussed leaving the state by year&#8217;s end, sources told the Times , while three limited liability companies associated with him have filed documents to incorporate in Florida.\nThe Thiel Foundation and Google parent Alphabet didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Thiel and Page did not respond to the Times .\nTech investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned on the risk of a wealth tax in California, saying it will eventually bankrupt the state.\n&#8220;The inevitable outcome will be an exodus of the state’s most talented entrepreneurs who can and will choose to build their companies in less regressive states,&#8221; he posted on X on Monday. &#8220;All that will be left behind is the middle class. The tax burden, then, will fall to the middle class because after the &#8216;richest&#8217; choose to leave, the middle class are both (a) the only ones left and (b) are the largest source of state income to extract taxes from.&#8221;\n\nOn Friday, he posted in a reply to Sen. Ted Cruz , who urged him to move to Texas, that it&#8217;s &#8220;under serious consideration.&#8221;\nBackers of the potential wealth tax must still gather enough signatures before it can qualify for the ballot in November 2026.\nThe proposal calls for California residents worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax equivalent to 5% of their assets. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Page is worth $270 billion and Thiel is worth $27.2 billion.\nThe healthcare union pushing the measure, the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, estimated the wealth tax could raise $100 billion in revenue and offset federal cuts.\nBut California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is also considered a top presidential hopeful, has come out against it.\n\nCompanies have already been leaving California for places with lower taxes and less red tape. Elon Musk moved Tesla and SpaceX to Texas.\nAnd while leading AI companies are based in California, new data centers and AI infrastructure are being built outside the state, where land, water and electricity are more available.\nNew Yorkers aired similar worries about an exodus after democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected the city&#8217;s mayor last month. But so far, that has yet to materialized as luxury home sales in Manhattan surged in November.\n\nStory Continues\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents part of Silicon Valley, said tax dollars helped build the AI industry and dismissed the idea that tech entrepreneurs wouldn&#8217;t start companies in the state due to a 1% tax, adding that innovators are drawn to the area&#8217;s talent.\n&#8220;We cannot have a nation with extreme concentration of wealth in a few places but where 70 percent of Americans believe the American dream is dead and healthcare, childcare, housing, education is unaffordable,&#8221; he said on X . &#8220;What will stifle American innovation, what will make us fall behind China, is if we see further political dysfunction and social unrest, if we fail to cultivate the talent in every American and in every city and town.&#8221;\nStill, he acknowledged lack of accountability and fraud concerns over state tax dollars, saying Sacramento needs anti-corruption measures.\nBlake Scholl, founder and CEO Boom Supersonic, pointed to the billions spent by California for a high-speed rail project that&#8217;s over-budget and behind schedule.\n&#8220;This is morally wrong and ends poorly for everyone,&#8221; he said about the wealth tax in response to Khanna on X.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is on pace to top the 2025 Magnificent Seven leaderboard, but investors who looked beyond U.S. tech found even richer returns across eight different global equity markets.\nShares of Google's parent company are up 66% year-to-date, the best performance among the seven mega-cap tech giants. That rally easily tops Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which is up 42%.\n\nYet the real surprise sits overseas.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nAcross emerging and developed markets alike, eight country exchange-traded funds tracking stocks from around the globe have outpaced Google's parent, offering a vivid reminder that the world's investment story this year is not solely written in Big Tech.\nAccording to data from CountryETFtracker, eight country-focused ETFs have delivered stronger year-to-date returns than Alphabet:\n8. iShares MSCI South Africa ETF (NYSE: EZA ), up 67.3%\n\n7. iShares MSCI Austria ETF (NYSE: EWO ), up 67.9%\n6.

Even lesser-known metals like platinum and palladium posted gains of 170% and 110%, respectively.\n\nFor stocks tied to these markets, it has been a windfall of gains.\nIn South Africa, miners dominated the tape. AngloGold Ashanti Plc (NYSE: AU ) and Gold Fields Limited Sponsored ADR (NYSE: GFI ), both top holdings in EZA, have each surged more than 220%.\nCurrency strength added fuel. The South African rand is up more than 11% against the dollar, on track for its best year since 2009.\nPeru followed a similar script. Six mining companies rank among the top 10 holdings in EPU. Each has posted triple-digit gains so far this year, lifting the entire market higher.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Peruvian sol gained over 10% against the dollar, on track for its best-performing year since Peru’s Central Bank issued the new currency in 1997.\nFor markets long viewed as cyclical or volatile, commodities turned into a powerful tailwind — and investors willing to look beyond the U.S. were rewarded.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 10:50 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nLLY\n\nABBV\n\nKey Points Amazon and Alphabet are key leaders in the AI race on top of their flagship businesses.\nWalmart benefits from consistent non-discretionary spending like groceries.\nEli Lilly and AbbVie are major pharmaceutical players that have impressive portfolios.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAttempting to time the market by identifying the exact bottom of a dip is very difficult, even for experienced investors. What appears to be a dip can turn into a prolonged decline or a falling knife, and you could just as easily miss out on the best market days to invest as you could the worst.\n\nInstead, by focusing your attention on making quality investments and additions to your portfolio in all market environments, you can withstand the highs and lows of market whims while enriching your portfolio over time.\nIf you have $50,000 to invest right now, you could choose to diversify that capital across a handful of different businesses. Here are five names that you might want to include on that list.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for its leading cloud infrastructure business and flagship e-commerce platform, but also boasts an ever-expanding presence across various sectors, including digital entertainment, groceries, advertising, and autonomous vehicles. Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) isn't just the most profitable segment for the company -- it's also the dominant player in the competitive cloud computing market and controls about 30% of this lucrative space.\n\nThe company remains the leading online retailer in the United States, with a market share of around 40%. Amazon is heavily investing in AI across its operations, from logistics optimization to developing custom AI chips like Trainium and Inferentia to offer clients a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs . These innovations are designed to improve efficiency and attract new customers to AWS.\nOpenAI has signed a landmark, multi-year deal to use AWS's infrastructure for running its AI workloads, including the training of future models. Until recently, Microsoft was OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider. The deal is a significant win for Amazon, as it reassures investors that AWS can compete effectively with other dominant players in providing AI infrastructure.\n\nThe deal involves a massive commitment of computing resources, and Amazon plans to build dedicated data center capacity for OpenAI. It's also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion or more in OpenAI. The investment would likely involve OpenAI using Amazon's custom-designed AI chips for some workloads to compete with Nvidia's dominant chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon remains extremely financially sound thanks to its strong balance sheet, consistent profitability, and expanding margins. Despite its status as a growth stock, the stock looks reasonably valued at approximately 27 times forward earnings.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has integrated AI seamlessly into its core products and created new tailwinds of growth for the business that long-term investors can capitalize on. The Gemini app alone has over 650 million monthly active users. There have been rumors that the company plans to monetize this user base through various forms of advertising, an area where Alphabet has long remained an indomitable leader.\n\nHowever, Google's Vice President of Global Ads, Daniel Taylor, and the official Google Ad Liaison account have publicly stated otherwise, so that remains unlikely, at least for now. The company is still actively monetizing AI in other areas, including AI Overviews in Google Search, and testing ads in AI Mode within Search. Meanwhile, the core Google Search business, along with YouTube, continues to drive profitable growth for the Alphabet ecosystem.\nGoogle Search & Other revenue reached $56.57 billion in Q3, a 15% year-over-year increase. YouTube advertising revenue surpassed the $10 billion mark for the first time in the third quarter (a 15% increase year over year). The Google Services segment, which includes Search and YouTube, also reported operating income of $33.53 billion (up about 9% from a year ago), despite absorbing a $3.5 billion European Commission fine during the quarter. And, consolidated revenue for Alphabet rose 16% to $102.35 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3 2025, and this segment's operating income increased by an eye-popping 85% in the same quarter. Alphabet's backlog of future cloud deals increased 79% in Q3. Alphabet also has potential future growth engines beyond its core businesses, including Waymo and advancements in quantum computing.\nDespite the stock's strong performance in 2025 (up over 60%), it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 30. Alphabet also retains approximately $98.5 billion in cash against $22 billion in long-term debt. This stock continues to look like a no-brainer buy.\n3. Walmart Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) is the world's largest retailer by sales. Its massive scale allows it to offer lower prices and negotiate better terms with suppliers, a significant advantage that helps it attract cost-conscious shoppers, including in inflationary periods.\nWalmart has effectively integrated its vast network of thousands of stores into its e-commerce operations and uses them as fulfillment hubs to offer fast delivery and easy in-store pickup options. This strategy has driven robust e-commerce growth (e-commerce sales were up 27% globally in Q3 FY26).\n\nThe company continues to expand into higher-margin areas like advertising and its membership program, which are contributing a meaningful share of operating income and bolstering overall profitability. Walmart also continues to invest in technology, automation, and AI-driven systems to improve its supply chain efficiency, inventory management, and customer experience, which could position it for long-term success against major retail competitors.\nIn Walmart's Q3, the company generated total revenue of $179.5 billion, up about 6% year over year. Its global advertising business clocked growth of 53%, bolstered by the integration of VIZIO and strong performance from Walmart Connect, while membership income increased 16.7% thanks to double-digit growth in Walmart+ and Sam's Club China memberships.\n\nHouseholds earning more than $100,000 accounted for 75% of Walmart's market share gains during the quarter. Approximately 35% of store-fulfilled orders in the U.S. were delivered in under three hours, with expedited delivery sales growing nearly 70%.\nWalmart is also a Dividend King, having raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years. This history of reliable payouts could appeal to income-focused, long-term investors and underscores its cash flow durability. Its current yield is in the ballpark of 0.8%, a bit below the average S&P 500 stock. While Walmart's trading higher than historical averages (about 38 times forward earnings), this stalwart consumer staples stock could be a smart addition to a long-term investor's portfolio.\n\n4. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) leads the market for GLP-1 medications and has officially surpassed its rival Novo Nordisk . The market for these drugs is projected to reach over $100 billion by 2030, so there's a considerable long-term growth opportunity for the company to continue to capitalize on.\nIts dual-acting drugs, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss), have shown superior efficacy compared to competitors in clinical trials, which has fueled a significant increase in Eli Lilly's market share.\n\nThe company has promising late-stage candidates, including the once-daily oral weight-loss pill orforglipron and the triple-agonist injectable retatrutide, which could further expand its market reach and offer more treatment options to patients. Eli Lilly has filed for FDA approval for orforglipron. It's a small molecule, easier to manufacture than peptides, and shows promise for diabetes as well as cardiovascular risk factors.\nRetatrutide replicates the effects of three different natural hormones: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon. By combining the effects of all three hormones, retatrutide is designed to be a highly effective treatment for conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could serve as a future pillar of Eli Lilly's portfolio.\n\nEli Lilly has consistently beaten analyst expectations, with its third-quarter 2025 revenue soaring 54% year over year to $17.6 billion. The company has invested billions in expanding its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and internationally to meet the explosive demand for its drugs.\nDespite the stock's high P/E ratio of around 34 on a forward basis, the company's strong growth prospects and dominant position in a revolutionary therapeutic area could warrant a long-term investment in this powerhouse healthcare stock. The company has also paid a dividend in some form since the 1800s, and regularly increases its payout. It's increased its dividend by a notable 15% for seven years in a row and counting.\n5. AbbVie AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) is benefiting from the burgeoning sales of its flagship immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which delivered combined revenues of about $7 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. These drugs are more than making up for the decline in sales of Humira, which was once the top-selling drug in the world, and have patent protection into the 2030s.\n\nThe drugmaker's overall net revenue for the three-month period totaled just shy of $16 billion, up 9% year over year. AbbVie has around 90 programs in its R&D pipeline across various therapeutic areas. Recent acquisitions have added promising new candidates to the mix.\nThese include candidates like Bretisilocin (from Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals) and ISB 2001 (from Ichnos Glenmark Innovation), and signal AbbVie's push into novel neuroscience and oncology, including psychedelic-inspired therapies and advnced antibody-based cancer drugs. Bretisilocin is a serotonin receptor agonist designed for major depressive disorder (MDD), while ISB 2001 is a T-cell engager for multiple myeloma.\nThe company has increased its dividend for 54 consecutive years (including its time as part of Abbott Laboratories ), which makes it another Dividend King on today's list. The current forward dividend yield is an attractive 3.05%.\n\nAbbVie stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 16. If you're looking for a quality healthcare stock to buy and hold for the long run, definitely don't overlook AbbVie the next time you go stock shopping.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026.

      "Content": "Google's Gemini Eating ChatGPT's Lunch: Market Share Gain From 5% To 18% Is 'Clearest Signal' That Alphabet Is Winning AI War\n\nRishabh Mishra\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nSMWB\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAlphabet Inc. 's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Gemini is executing a silent takeover of the generative AI market, surging to an 18.2% traffic share in just one year while industry pioneer ChatGPT suffers a massive double-digit decline in dominance.\nThe Great AI Migration New data from Similarweb reveals a dramatic reshaping of the AI landscape. Over the last 12 months, Google's Gemini has more than tripled its slice of generative AI web traffic, climbing from a modest 5.4% to 18.2%.\nThis surge comes directly at the expense of OpenAI 's ChatGPT, which has seen its stranglehold on the market loosen significantly.\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nOnce commanding an 87.2% share, ChatGPT has slid to 68.0%—a staggering 19-point drop. Market analysts are calling this a definitive “takeover arc,” suggesting that the initial hype wave is settling into a phase where Google's infrastructure is winning out.\n“That is not noise,” noted Solid Finance CEO Sam Badawi . “If you believe web behavior reflects user preference at scale, then this is the clearest signal that [Google] is not only in the game, it is winning share.”\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nCapturing The ‘Flow’ The driver behind this shift appears to be Google's mastery of “native distribution.” Unlike standalone competitors, Gemini is increasingly embedded where users already live: inside Chrome, Android, Workspace, and Search.\nAccording to strategist Shay Boloor , this integration is the key differentiator. As AI usage transitions from novelty to routine utility, products with native distribution naturally “capture the flow.”\nBy surfacing AI answers directly within existing workflows, Google is removing the friction of switching apps, effectively siphoning users who might otherwise navigate to ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Copilot, despite being baked into Windows and Edge, has barely moved the needle, stagnating from 1.5% to 1.2% share over the same period.\nThe contrast suggests that while distribution is powerful, product trust is paramount. While Copilot has flatlined, Gemini is successfully converting its vast reach into recurring user habits, proving that Google is earning user trust in a way its big-tech rival has yet to replicate.\n\nGOOG Outperforms In 2025 Shares of Alphabet’s Class C have risen by 65.59% year-to-date and 60.16% over the year, whereas the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced by 22.31% and 17.86%, respectively.\nIn the near term, GOOG has gained 80.97% over the last six months, but fell 1.44% over the last month. On Wednesday, the shares closed largely unchanged, 0.0032% lower at $315.67 apiece.\n\nIt maintains a stronger price trend over the short, medium, and long terms, with a poor value ranking.

      "Content": "Here Are My Top 3 Growth Stocks to Buy Now\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nLLY\n\nMELI\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is the e-commerce and fintech leader in Latin America.\nEli Lilly is already looking ahead to its next generation of successes both in and outside of the GLP-1 industry.\nAlphabet's AI infrastructure is driving gains for its own business and external customers.\n10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre ›\n\nGrowth stocks are a great option for long-term investors due to their potential for high capital appreciation. These companies typically operate in innovative and dynamic industries and reinvest their earnings back into the business to fuel further expansion. This can lead to significant stock price increases through the years that can enrich your portfolio through the beauty of compounding returns.\nIf you're looking for top growth stocks to buy right now, here are three no-brainer names to consider.\n1. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is quickly becoming the digital backbone of Latin America, as its integrated e-commerce , logistics, and fintech ecosystem continues to thrive. By handling 95% of its own deliveries through its Mercado Envíos network, MercadoLibre achieves faster and more reliable shipping than its competitors, which remains a critical advantage amid the region's often-challenging infrastructure.\n\nThe company's Mercado Pago division provides essential financial services in an underbanked region. Its total credit portfolio has reached $11 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2025, up 83% from a year ago, and a large portion of its payment volume is coming from outside the e-commerce platform.\nMercadoLibre has been cash-flow positive every year since 2007 and has demonstrated an ability to fund its own expansion without excessive reliance on external capital. Newer ventures like digital advertising are high-margin businesses that can leverage the company's vast user data to drive growth and improve overall profitability in the years ahead.\nIn Q3 2025, MercadoLibre's net revenue popped 39% year over year to $7.4 billion, the 27th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth greater than 30%. Brazil is immensely important to MercadoLibre as the company's single largest and most crucial market, which accounts for over half of its total revenues. Management has emphasized a focus on long-term value creation over short-term margin improvements, making significant investments in logistics and expanding free shipping in Brazil.\n\nThe lowered free shipping threshold in Brazil led to a surge in items sold in Q3 (up 42% year over year in Brazil) and the largest quarterly addition of unique buyers in the company's history. Unique buyers in Brazil were up 29% year over year in Q3. MercadoLibre delivered about $718 million in adjusted free cash flow in the first nine months of 2025 alone. If you want to invest in a top-notch e-commerce and fintech stock, MercadoLibre looks like a no-brainer buy.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) briefly reached a $1 trillion market cap earlier this year, becoming the first healthcare company to achieve that milestone thanks to the explosive growth and global adoption of its obesity and diabetes treatments. In Q3 2025, Lilly reported 54% year-over-year revenue growth to $17.6 billion. Combined sales of its GLP-1 products Mounjaro (diabetes) and Zepbound (obesity) totaled over $10 billion in a single quarter and now account for more than 50% of the company's total revenue.\n\nLilly has unseated its rival Novo Nordisk as the market leader in the GLP-1 space and now controls nearly 60% of total U.S. prescriptions for these medications. The company recently submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA for its once-daily GLP-1 pill, forglipron, for the treatment of obesity in adults, following positive results from its Phase 3 trial. In this trial, orforglipron significantly outperformed the placebo in maintaining weight loss over 52 weeks in patients previously on semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) or tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound).\nThis trial specifically tested weight maintenance after initial intensive treatment to demonstrate orforglipron's role in preventing weight regain. Patients switching from Wegovy regained approximately 2 pounds, and those switching from Zepbound regained approximately 11 pounds compared to the placebo. The pill was awarded a Commissioner's National Priority Voucher.\n\nWhile standard reviews typically take around 10 months, this voucher could result in an FDA decision as early as the first quarter of 2026. Lilly's CEO previously estimated a target approval date around March 2026. A separate application for orforglipron to treat Type 2 diabetes is expected to follow in the new year too. If approved, orforglipron will be the first small-molecule, once-daily oral GLP-1 receptor agonist available for weight management. Analysts expect it to generate up to $40 billion in annual revenue at its peak.\nAnother key GLP-1 drug candidate is Eli Lilly's retatrutide, a first-in-class triple hormone receptor agonist, which means it mimics the effects of three naturally occurring hunger-regulating hormones simultaneously. The drug is currently in Phase 3 trials and has shown unprecedented weight loss results (averaging 28.2%) in clinical data released in late 2025. Beyond weight loss, Lilly is seeing strong demand for Kisunla, its Alzheimer's treatment, which is expected to launch in multiple European markets in 2026. This appears to be a fantastic healthcare stock to buy and hold for the long term. It also happens to be a long-standing dividend payer, with a yield just under 1% partly due to the stock's generous run-up of 40% over the last year.\n\n3. Alphabet In Q3 2025, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) reported its first-ever $100 billion quarter. Its total revenue reached $102.3 billion (up 16% from a year ago), and diluted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 35.4% to $2.87. The company maintains one of the world's strongest balance sheets , with $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities as of the last count. Google Cloud revenue increased 34% year over year to $15.2 billion in Q3 2025. Operating margins for this segment also expanded significantly to 23.7%, up from 17.1% a year earlier.\n\nThe company has a massive $155 billion backlog of non-recognized sales contracts, which reflects the impressive future demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered infrastructure. Alphabet's primary AI model, Gemini, now has over 650 million monthly active users and is driving a 3x increase in search queries through AI Overviews. Moreover, Alphabet's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are seeing high demand from external companies, which could potentially create a multibillion-dollar revenue stream.\nDespite fears of AI disruption, Google Search revenue grew 14.5% year over year in Q3 to $56.6 billion as the company maintains its roughly 90% global share of the search engine market. Advertising revenue on YouTube grew 15% to $10.3 billion, bolstered by the monetization of Shorts, and paid subscriptions (YouTube Premium, Google One) crossed 300 million, underscoring the ability of this segment to provide a stable, high-margin recurring revenue stream.\n\nAlphabet has been one of the best-performing stocks in the Magnificent Seven for 2025, with shares rising roughly 60% year to date. Despite the rally, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) around 28, which is quite reasonable given its more than 30% earnings growth rate. Investors should also pay attention to Alphabet's Waymo. The autonomous driving subsidiary is emerging as a leader in the U.S. robotaxi market, with fully autonomous, publicly available services currently operating in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Austin, Texas.\nWaymo is rapidly expanding, processing over 450,000 paid rides per week, and is reportedly in talks to raise over $15 billion at a valuation approaching $100 billion. Alphabet remains a top tech stock that looks like a great buy now and for the long term if you're a growth-oriented investor seeking a profitable, powerhouse business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?

      "Content": "Is Nebius Stock Set to Double in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nebius recently signed a contract with a key hyperscaler.\nManagement dramatically expanded its projections for 2026.\nThe stock is very expensive.\n10 stocks we like better than Nebius Group ›\nNebius Group (NASDAQ: NBIS) stock has been on an absolute tear in 2025. The stock's price has more than tripled, up around 225%, while also being down 33% from all-time highs established in October. Given that volatility, investors are likely wondering where Nebius' stock will go heading into 2026.\nWhile it will be difficult to post 200%-plus annual gains, Nebius may be in line to double in value, especially with all the massive artificial intelligence (AI) spending planned for 2026.\nNebius believes that 2026 will be even better than 2025 Nebius was formerly a part of Yandex, essentially the Russian equivalent of Google. Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war and all the sanctions that fell on Russia, Yandex decided to split its company into Russian and non-Russian assets, and Nebius was spun out. Nebius, now headquartered in Amsterdam, is a technology company that has pivoted its operations and now provides AI infrastructure.\n\nNebius is another way to invest in the thriving artificial intelligence boom, as it offers full-stack capabilities with best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) at the data centers it owns or leases. Nebius' biggest clients include Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and it has signed large, multi-year contracts with both of them.\nThe demand for AI computing power in data centers isn't expected to slow down, and Nebius has modified its initial 2026 plans as a result. Previously, it expected to contract 1 gigawatt of computing power for 2026. Now, it's upped that guidance to more than 2.5 gigawatts. It's increasing its power needs because it has sold out all available computing capacity for the third quarter.\n\nIt's sold out of capacity, resulting in unbelievable revenue growth of 355% year over year to $146 million in Q3. However, that's a drop in the bucket compared to where Nebius will be next year.\nFor the full year, it's expecting $500 million to $550 million in revenue. Because it's growing so fast, that number is much smaller than the $900 million to $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) it expects to achieve. For most companies, ARR would be how much revenue they would generate each year if they ceased all growth opportunities. So, seeing this figure so much higher than actual revenue showcases Nebius' impressive growth. While 2025 has been good, 2026 will be even better.\n\nStory Continues\nNebius management believes the company can achieve a $7 billion to $9 billion ARR at the end of 2026. At a minimum, that's seven times Nebius' current ARR. Growth like that gets investors excited, and it could easily translate into a stock that can double, as long as you don't have to overpay for the stock now.\n\nNebius is unprofitable, and its stock is expensive Valuing Nebius stock isn't easy. Profits aren't even close to becoming a reality, so valuing the company based on forward earnings isn't possible. Although it brought in $146 million in revenue during Q3, its net income loss totaled $120 million. Nebius is funding its growth at the cost of profitability, which may turn some investors away. Nebius will likely continue to stay unprofitable as it expands its operations to account for the massive surge in computing demand.\n\nFrom a price-to-sales (PS) standpoint, Nebius stock is very expensive at nearly 60 times sales. That's expensive for a stock in general, let alone one that's as unprofitable as Nebius is. However, its growth is incredible, and if it grows at the pace investors expect, valuation may not be as big a concern.\nThe real factor in Nebius stock performance in 2026 will be the market's appetite for risk. The market is currently somewhat bearish on AI sentiment, even if the spending is happening. The market wants to see real returns from the AI hyperscalers, and it's not seeing that right now. Time will tell what will happen with Nebius stock, but I could easily see the stock doubling in price in 2026 if bullish sentiment returns, or getting cut in half if the market takes a bearish outlook.\n\nAs a result, I'd rather invest in a more surefire pick like Nvidia , which is providing GPUs for companies like Nebius at a high profitability level.\nShould you buy stock in Nebius Group right now? Before you buy stock in Nebius Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nebius Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Analysis-Waymo's San Francisco outage raises doubts over robotaxi readiness during crises\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPCG\n\nTSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A widespread power outage in San Francisco that led to Waymo robotaxis stalling and snarling traffic earlier this month has raised concerns about the readiness of autonomous vehicle operators to tackle major emergencies like earthquakes and floods.\nDriverless taxis from Alphabet unit ​Waymo, a ubiquitous feature on the city's streets, were stuck at intersections with their hazard lights turned on as traffic lights stopped working following a fire ‌at a PG&E substation that knocked out power to roughly one-third of the city on December 20, videos posted on social media showed. Waymo halted operations, resuming a day later.\n\nThe incident has renewed calls for ‌stricter regulation of the nascent but fast-growing industry as other companies including Tesla and Amazon's Zoox race to expand robotaxi services in several cities.\n\"If you get a response to a blackout wrong, regulators are derelict if they do not respond to that by requiring some sort of proof that the earthquake scenario will be handled properly,\" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Waymo said that while its robotaxis are designed to handle non-operational traffic signals as four-way stops, they occasionally request a ⁠confirmation check. Though the vehicles successfully traversed more than 7,000 ‌darkened signals on Saturday, \"the outage created a concentrated spike\" in confirmation requests that \"led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets,\" Waymo said.\n\nRobotaxi operators around the globe use remote access by humans - known in the industry as \"teleoperation\" - in varying degrees to monitor and control ‍vehicles. Waymo, for example, has a team of human \"fleet response\" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver, its bot, when it encounters a particular situation.\nBut such remote assistance has its limitations, and the Waymo outage highlights the need to regulate how robotaxi operators use the technology, said Missy Cummings, director of the George Mason University Autonomy and Robotics Center and former adviser to ​the U.S. road safety regulator.\n\"The whole point of having remote operations is for humans to be there when the system is not responsive in the way it should ‌be,\" she said. \"The federal government needs to regulate remote operations,\" Cummings said. \"They need to make sure that there's backup remote operations when there's some kind of catastrophic failure.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCalifornia's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulate and issue permits for the testing and commercial deployment of robotaxis, have said they are looking into the incident.\nThe DMV said it was talking to Waymo and other autonomous vehicle makers about actions related to emergency response. It also said it was formulating regulations to ensure remote drivers \"meet high standards for safety, accountability and responsiveness.\"\n\n'A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW'\nDeploying and commercializing fully autonomous vehicles have been harder than expected with high investments to ensure the technology is ⁠safe and public outcry after collisions forcing many to shut shop.\nFollowing a high-profile accident in 2023 ​when a robotaxi from General Motors' Cruise dragged a pedestrian, regulators revoked its permit, eventually leading the ​company to cease operations.\nBut robotaxis have returned to the spotlight with Tesla rolling out its service in Austin, Texas earlier this year and CEO Elon Musk promising rapid expansion. Waymo, which has grown slowly and steadily over the years since its launch as Google's self-driving project in ‍2009, has also accelerated expansion.\nWith a fleet of ⁠more than 2,500 vehicles, Waymo operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Metro Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe company said the confirmation processes its vehicles follow were established during early deployment and that it was now refining them to match its current scale. Waymo is implementing fleet-wide updates that provide vehicles with \"specific ⁠power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.\"\nBoth Cummings and Koopman said robotaxi operators should face additional permitting requirements once their fleets grow beyond a certain size to ensure that they have adequate ‌capabilities to deal with large-scale failures.\n\"If this had been an earthquake, it would have been a problem,\" Koopman said. \"This is just a shot across ‌the bow.\"\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Alistair Bell)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The AI trade is very well understood, at least through my client base with\n00:20 Ted\nthe you look at the infrastructure build really outpacing enterprise uh adoption. And that's the issue. Uh we're going to spend at a 40% clip here for the next couple years. Uh the Sox is up, the semiconductor index is up uh almost 48% year to date. And if you look at the IGV or the software index that's been the big laggard, only up 7.8%. So all I think of this is understood. As we uh as we look into 26, there's there's three issues that I'm uh looking at very, very closely and we can go in that if you'd like to.\n00:54 Speaker B\nYeah, I'd like to go into that. And maybe Ted, on that on that point you just brought up, I just want to drill into that. This this mismatch as you say between the the data center build out and the the real enterprise AI adoption. When would you expect Ted then to see that enterprise AI adoption story play out? Is is is that a 2026 story, Ted? Is it 2027? What do you think?\n01:21 Ted\nRight now, that's a it's hard to nail down, but I don't think it's 26. The enterprise, there's only roughly 30% of the Global 2000 that's ready to move to Gen AI. 70% is still going through data cloud migration and uh data cleansing to get into an LLM. So, we've got, you know, enterprise it always takes so much longer than the street is looking at. That mismatch probably goes into 27, 28 is my guess.\n01:54 Speaker B\nAnd and how what are the signs and signals Ted as investors I would be looking for to say, okay, now we're really saying seeing AI monetization, not just AI marketing. I mean, am I looking at software spend? Am I watching the cloud businesses? Like what should I be looking for, Ted?\n02:22 Ted\nI think I think it's it's well understood that the cloud Titans are going to see it in token growth as well as just their their overall cloud growth. Where I think it's really instrumental to see enterprise adoption is uh via your last few guests, is in the software area. Specifically on the agentic plays, whether it be, you know, a CRM, a ServiceNow, a hubspot, um, you know, and then the whole security sector is moving to AI. I think if you see robust, um, uh net new ARR, that's that's going to be a very good indication of enterprise uh adoption.\n03:22 Speaker B\nYou you another theme Ted, I want your take on which you wrote about was obviously, you know, the massive uh CAPEX by tech giants. But of course we've seen these concerns creeping up at least with some names Ted, financial stress, you know, debt loads, and I'm just curious how you're thinking through that dynamic.\n03:52 Ted\nWell, my clients do not want to play names that are negative free cash flow. Uh this is one of these cycles because of this mismatch in infrastructure, it's very capital intensive on this infrastructure build. So the only real names that really have the the the businesses behind it to really uh fund the capX is Microsoft and Google and that you know, Google's up 87% uh year to date. Um so with with that, um I I think uh there's a propensity to just watch and have some dry powder. Um I don't have a lot of interest in some of the negative free cash flow names at this point. And it's obvious I think as we go forward that you're getting indications that whether it be Anthropic or whether it be Open AI or SpaceX, that the debt market is tapped and the it's not big enough quite frankly to fund the infrastructure build. So all of these next generation companies are going to have to tap the equity market. And my worry there is very simple after doing this for a few decades is when you have four or five major tech companies that have to raise just a boatload of capital. Open AI has been rumored a hundred billion dollars. My worry is that we get some time in the in in 26 where all these guys come public at the same time and we drain quote unquote the equity liquidity lake, if you will. And my PMs are going to be forced to sell some of their winners to to fund some of these uh positions in these new companies.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer talked about.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares have gained 36% year-to-date and have lost 8.9% since October’s end. The firm made quite a splash on December 24th after chip designer Groq announced that it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with it. Under the agreement, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will buy Groq’s assets for a $20 billion price tag to make it its largest acquisition to date. Earlier in December, Bernstein reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares and a $275 share price target. Bernstein pointed out that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still waiting for US approvals to sell its H200 chips to China. Crucially, Bernstein also pointed out that the chip designer believes it enjoys a two-year advantage over Google’s TPU AI chips. These chips have been seen as an alternative to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s pricey AI GPUs. Cramer also believes that the firm’s latest Rubin AI GPUs will make their mark felt:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "3 Genius Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 11:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nKey Points Alphabet is getting closer to useful quantum technology.\nNvidia recently released a product that will enable hybrid quantum computing.\nIonQ's quantum computer is leading the pack for accuracy.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nQuantum computing isn't as popular a theme among investors now as it was just a couple of months ago, which means that this could be a good time to start considering some top-tier stocks in this segment. Stock prices in the industry are driven by hype at this stage, and when the hype cycle is low, it can offer opportunities to buy in.\n\nWith experts not expecting quantum computing systems to deliver broad real-world advantages over classical computers any earlier than 2030, we have a long way to go before we find out which companies will be the winners in this emerging industry. As a result, I think it's better for investors interested in getting exposure to the technology to spread their investments out across multiple companies -- some that have established businesses in other areas and are also involved in quantum computing, as well as some of the riskier quantum computing pure plays.\nI think a diversified trio of stocks like this one would be a great place for investors to start.\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has become one of the biggest companies in the world thanks to the dominance of Google Search. The profits from ad sales connected to that product have allowed Alphabet to fund other endeavors, such as its popular generative AI model and its dominant cloud computing business. Another area that it's diving into is quantum computing, and it seems to be having some success with that technology.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced that its Willow chip had run an algorithm that for the first time demonstrated a verifiable quantum computing advantage. This is a huge deal because it shows that viable quantum computing isn't as far away as some may think. While the forecast arrival of generally useful quantum computing is still no sooner than 2030, in some niche cases, it could prove viable sooner than that.\nAlphabet, of course, isn't an all-or-nothing investment in this new technology. The company is a massive and diversified business that uses excess cash flow from its core operations to fund new research. If it can develop effective quantum computing technologies in-house, those will boost its artificial intelligence efforts and increase its cloud computing client base.\nAlphabet's base businesses are set to thrive in 2026, and with plenty of cash to fund its quantum research, its stock is a top pick in the space.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't making a quantum processing unit to compete with all of the various companies involved in this realm. Instead, it's focusing on maximizing its traditional graphics processing units (GPUs). But it's not ignoring the quantum realm.\nNvidia understands that this new technology will likely be deployed in hybrid systems that use both traditional and quantum computers. This will require an interface between the two, and Nvidia released NVQLink to serve just that purpose.\n\nThis ensures that many cutting-edge quantum computing players will be using its hardware and software to interface with classical hardware, making it a perfect investment to bridge the gap between the old and the new technologies.\nWith demand for its AI accelerators not expected to slow down, Nvidia should be a great stock to own while we wait for quantum technology to arrive.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is one of the risky upstarts that's betting it all on bringing a practical version of this technology to market. There are several other small quantum computing pure plays, but in my opinion, IonQ is the best bet to provide a useful application.\nAll quantum computers are built around qubits (quantum bits), but there are numerous ways to create them. IonQ is taking a relatively unusual approach -- trapped ion qubits. That technology trades some speed for greater accuracy. Right now, IonQ holds the world record for the quantum computing system with the best two-qubit gate fidelity, which is a measure of how unlikely it is for the system to have a result with an error in it after a computation passes through two quantum operations.\n\nThe company has achieved 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, indicating about one error in every 10,000 operations. That's a huge lead over its rivals, which have yet to breach the 99.9% threshold (one error in every 1,000 operations).\nTime will tell if this head start will be enough for it to establish itself as the top quantum computing provider, but it's a good beginning. IonQ is the leading start-up quantum computing business, so it's my top pick for the high-risk side of this group of investments.\nIf IonQ's approach pans out, it could provide monster returns. If it doesn't, the stock will likely go to $0. However, even if that happens, your investments in Alphabet and Nvidia should be able to pick up the slack, which is why it's smart to balance out risky investments with more conservative ones.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,994 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,156,218 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 986 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

The fund reported holding 224,842 shares with a market value of approximately $9.46 million at quarter-end, representing approximately 2.84% of its total reportable U.S. equity assets.\n\nWhat Else to Know Top five holdings after the filing:\nNYSEMKT: SPY: $53.02 million (15.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IBIT: $25.17 million (7.6% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: GOOGL: $15.19 million (4.6% of AUM)\nNYSE: CRC: $11.29 million (3.4% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ITRN: $10.02 million (3.0% of AUM)\nAs of Friday, Fluor shares were priced at $40.69, down 20% over the past year and well underperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 15% in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$15.59 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$3.38 billion\nPrice (as of Friday)\n$40.69\nOne-Year Price Change\n(20%)\n\nCompany Snapshot Fluor Corporation provides engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services, project management, fabrication, modularization, and asset integrity solutions across energy, infrastructure, government, and technology markets.\nThe company operates a project-driven business model, generating revenue through large-scale contracts in energy transition, infrastructure, advanced technologies, life sciences, mining, and government services.\nIt serves oil, gas, petrochemical, infrastructure, mining, life sciences, advanced technology firms, and U.S. government agencies as primary customers.\n\nFluor Corporation is a global leader in engineering and construction services, with a diversified portfolio spanning energy, infrastructure, technology, and government projects. The company leverages its scale and technical expertise to deliver complex projects and solutions for both private and public sector clients. Its strategic focus on energy transition and mission-critical government services positions Fluor to capitalize on long-term industry trends and evolving client needs.\nFoolish Take Stepping into Fluor Corporation after a difficult stretch for the civil engineer firm suggests a willingness to look past headline noise and focus on normalized earnings power. Fluor’s third quarter was messy on the surface. Revenue fell 18% year over year and GAAP results were dragged down by legacy project charges and NuScale mark-to-market volatility. But dig deeper and the underlying picture looks steadier. Adjusted EBITDA climbed 29% year over year to $161 million, and management raised full-year adjusted EPS and EBITDA guidance. Just as important, 82% of the $28.2 billion backlog is reimbursable, limiting downside risk from cost overruns and execution surprises.\n\nCapital allocation is also doing some quiet heavy lifting. The company repurchased $70 million of stock in the quarter and is targeting up to $800 million more through early 2026, supported by $2.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Meanwhile, new awards totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter, with nearly all of it reimbursable work. For long-term investors, this looks less like a turnaround gamble and more like a patience play. The risk is real, but so is the margin of safety if execution holds.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary 13F assets under management: The total value of U.S. equity securities reported by an institutional investment manager in SEC Form 13F filings.\nAssets under management (AUM): The total market value of assets a fund or investment firm manages on behalf of clients.\nPosition: The amount of a particular security or investment held by an investor or fund.\nStake: The ownership interest or share an investor holds in a company or asset.\nTop five holdings: The five largest investments in a fund's portfolio, ranked by market value.\nFiling: An official document submitted to a regulatory agency, often disclosing financial or investment information.\nEngineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services: Comprehensive project services covering design, material sourcing, and building for large-scale infrastructure or industrial projects.\nProject-driven business model: A business approach where revenue is primarily generated from executing individual client projects rather than recurring sales.\nEnergy transition: The shift from traditional fossil fuels to renewable and low-carbon energy sources.\nModularization: The process of constructing sections of a project off-site for later assembly at the final location.\nAsset integrity solutions: Services ensuring that physical assets, such as infrastructure or equipment, remain safe, reliable, and efficient throughout their lifecycle.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Nvidia's Groq deal underscores how the AI chip giant uses its massive balance sheet to 'maintain dominance'\n\nLaura Bratton\nUpdated Fri, December 26, 2025 at 10:33 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nMU\n\nXAAI.PVT\n\nNvidia’s ( NVDA ) licensing deal with chip startup Groq ( GROQ.PVT ) shows how the tech giant is leveraging its massive cash pile to sustain its preeminence in the AI market.\nNvidia this week said it struck a non-exclusive deal with Groq to license its technology and hired the startup’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, its president, and other employees. CNBC reported the agreement to be worth $20 billion , marking Nvidia’s largest-ever deal. (The company declined a request for comment on the figure.)\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients Thursday that the Nvidia-Groq deal “appears strategic in nature for NVDA as they leverage their increasingly powerful balance sheet to maintain dominance in key areas.” Nvidia’s cash inflow climbed more than 30% from the previous year to $22 billion in its most recent quarter.\n\"This transaction is ... essentially an acquisition of Groq without being labeled one (to avoid the regulators' scrutiny),\" added Hedgeye Risk Management analysts in a note Friday.\n\nThe move is just the latest in a string of AI deals by Nvidia, the world’s first $5 trillion company . The chipmaker’s investments in AI firms span the entire market, ranging from large language model developers such as OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and xAI ( XAAI.PVT ) to “neoclouds” like Lambda ( LAMD.PVT ) and CoreWeave ( CRWV ), which specialize in AI services and compete with its Big Tech customers.\n\nNvidia has also invested in chipmakers Intel ( INTC ) and Enfabrica. The company made a failed attempt around 2020 to acquire British chip architecture designer Arm ( ARM ).\nNvidia’s wide-ranging investments — many of them in its own customers — have led to accusations that it’s involved in circular financing schemes reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. The company has vehemently denied those claims.\nGroq, meanwhile, was looking to become one of Nvidia’s rivals.\nFounded in 2016, Groq makes LPUs (language processing units) geared toward AI inferencing and marketed as alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units).\nTraining AI models involves teaching a model to learn patterns from large amounts of data, while \"inferencing\" refers to using that trained model to generate outputs. Both processes demand massive computing power from AI chips.\n\nWhile Nvidia easily dominates the chip market for AI training, some analysts argue that Nvidia could soon see greater competition in the inference space. That’s because custom chips like Google's ( GOOG ) TPUs (tensor processing units) — and arguably Groq’s chips called LPUs (language processing units) — may be better suited for certain tasks. LPUs, for instance, are faster and more energy efficient when used for certain models, utilizing a type of memory technology called SRAM within the chips. On the other hand, Nvidia GPUs rely on off-chip HBM made by companies like Micron ( MU ) and Samsung ( 005930.KS ).\n\nStory Continues\nRoss, the Groq CEO, said in a recent interview that the upstart aimed to provide chips for half the world’s AI inference computing needs — and cheaply.\n“What we want to do is we want to drive the cost of compute as close to zero as we can get it. Every year we want to make it cheaper,” he told Indian business outlet YourStory . Notably, Ross already helped create Nvidia’s greatest source of competition: The executive led the development of Google’s first-generation TPUs.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst CJ Muse said Nvidia’s \"acqui-hire\" of Groq talent and licensing of its intellectual property showed the chipmaker “is playing both offense and defense” in the AI space. Muse said the deal would allow Nvidia to take “even greater share of the inference market.”\nNvidia shares rose more than 1% Friday.\nOthers on Wall Street were more confused by Nvidia’s move and its potential $20 billion price tag. Hedgeye Risk Management analysts argued that Groq's chips are \"still unproven\" when it comes to large AI models, due to their low memory capacity.\n\"Groq's current technology is greatly limited to only a small subset of inference workloads,\" added DA Davidson analyst Alex Platt.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Eric here.\nPayPal is all in on stablecoins.\nThe $56 billion payment giant’s CEO, Alex Chriss, told Fortune this week that it is integrating blockchain solutions across its verticals.\nWhy? Because the 30-year-old venture must reinvent itself to stay relevant in an ever-changing world.\n\n“If you were to build the payments ecosystem from scratch today, it wouldn’t look like the way it does today,” said Chriss. “You would start to use some sort of blockchain, or some sort of thing that probably looks a lot like stablecoin.”\nPayPal is hardly alone. Wall Street players aplenty are on a campaign to integrate blockchain solutions into their offerings.\nTech titans like Stripe and Google are launching their own blockchains, banks such as Santander and Société Générale are reportedly exploring the creation of their own stablecoins, and crypto firms and institutional players are scooping up blockchain businesses in multi-million-dollar acquisitions.\nAs Mike Giampapa, general partner at Galaxy Ventures, told me, institutions “view these efforts as opportunities for growth and margin expansion, replacing legacy rails with modern blockchain infrastructure without requiring end users to materially change existing behaviour.”\n\nThese efforts are expected to continue next year, too.\nIf 2025 was the year when regulators and lawmakers cleared the path for traditional financial firms to adopt crypto rails, 2026 is set to be the year when they take advantage of that opportunity.\nAnd rest assured that DL News will be there to report on it.\nBrazilian $195,000 music project will let audiences ‘hear’ Bitcoin price changes Brazil’s culture ministry has given its blessing to an art project that aims to turn Bitcoin price volatility into impromptu musical masterpieces, Tim Alper reports.\nHow crypto airdrops will change in 2026 The days of experimenting with new protocols and receiving lumps of valuable tokens are fading away, Tim Craig writes.\nWhy South Korea and Japan are bidding to make 2026 the year of the stablecoin South Korea and Japan are playing catch-up in the stablecoins game in the face of a US-dominated global stablecoin market worth around $255 billion.\nPost of the Week You haven’t missed the State of Defi report, created in collaboration with DL News and our friends over at DefiLlama and DL Research, have you?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Tesla’s (TSLA) stock four years ago, it would be worth about $13,700 today, thanks to a 37% price gain since late December 2021.\nThat’s a solid profit, but it falls well short of the massive returns you’d have gotten with other high-profile stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) or Alphabet (GOOG). The next four years could be a lot more lucrative for Tesla investors — or a lot worse.\n\nWhat could a $10,000 Tesla investment today look like by 2030? Here’s what a couple of experts had to say.\nAlso see the Tesla investing mistake that could cost you thousands .\nThe Bull Case A $10,000 investment in Tesla today could be worth twice that much by 2030 if the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle (EV) maker reaches certain benchmarks, according to Chad Cummings, an attorney and certified public accountant (CPA) at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax.\n\nBut for that to happen, a lot of things would have to go the right way.\n“If Tesla scales its energy storage segment and increases paid software penetration above current rates, [its] position could exceed $20,000,” Cummings told GOBankingRates. “The S&P 500 at an 8% compound rate places the same $10,000 near $15,900, which is the realistic hurdle Tesla must beat. Even so, there are some major headwinds.”\nThose headwinds include “litigation and regulatory exposure” that could drive Tesla’s downside more than macro trends, according to Cummings.\n“A single autonomous-related fatality that triggers a regulatory halt can cut Tesla’s valuation by tens of billions within days,” he said. “The insurance and legal systems still have yet to fully price in autonomous driving and the results, which creates something of a hot potato.”\n\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nLooking Beyond the EV Market Another thing to keep an eye on is how Tesla’s non-EV businesses perform over the next few years — mainly its energy generation/storage and other services. These businesses are considered by many to be the stock’s main growth drivers.\n“A $10,000 investment in Tesla right now depends less on the EV side than people think,” said Edward Corona, founder of The Options Oracle AI Trade Manager . “I honestly don’t believe Tesla’s main focus is cars anymore — but they still need the car business to keep the money flowing while they build everything else. And Elon has about one trillion reasons now to make sure the long-term plan pays off.”\nThe “one trillion reasons” comment refers to Musk’s new compensation package , which could be worth about $1 trillion if certain milestones are met.\n\nStory Continues\nBy 2030, a $10,000 investment will “come down to whether Tesla can use the EV side to fund the bigger vision without letting margins fall apart,” Corona told GOBankingRates. “If they balance that right, the stock could look a lot different in a few years. If they don’t, investors will feel it. Tesla’s future isn’t about selling cars — it’s about whether the rest of the plan actually gets executed.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Things have only gone downhill for the stock as Wall Street began doubting the story.\nORCL stock has plummeted by over 40% from its peak after Q2 earnings. FY 2026 earnings disappointed investors. Analysts began piling concerns about how overextended data center spending was and whether it was even sustainable for Oracle to fund the growth. Investors baked in a valuation that would only make sense if Oracle managed to grow at a blistering pace for years with ever-growing margins.\nBut now that ORCL stock is down from its peak, should you buy the dip or jump ship? Let's first take a look at what's wrong here.\n\nWhy investors are dumping ORCL stock Investors' pet peeve with Oracle is that the funding is proving to be quite unreliable. News came out that Blue Owl Capital was withdrawing from its funding commitments, meaning that Oracle's $10 billion Michigan data center was in jeopardy. Oracle denied this and said that the news reports were \"incorrect\". Oracle's Partner, Related Digital, said that Blue Owl did not withdraw unequivocally and that the company still had others willing to fund the project.\n\nIn any case, this has thrown sand into the gears. Q2 FY 2026 didn't help, either.\nIt invited a fresh wave of criticism after Oracle reported $16.06 billion in revenue, up 14.22% year-over-year. This missed the estimates by $134.2 million. EPS did beat estimates by a wide margin, but this was due to a one-time boost from Oracle selling its Ampere stake.\nThe Wall Street Journal pointed to another \"squishy number\" that investors are paying more attention to as Oracle's story looks more brittle. Remaining performance obligations (RPOs) have surged to $523 billion. What are these RPOs? Sales that management believes are probable. Half a trillion dollars of \"probable\" sales looked more or less guaranteed a few months back. But with that Blue Owl debacle and the AI buildout catching more flak, Wall Street is less willing to price that in.\n\nStory Continues\nTime to go bottom fishing with ORCL stock? If those RPOs do convert to sales, the picture looks rosier than ever, but it's still worth keeping in mind how quickly things can go wrong. For example, Oracle has a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, set to begin in 2027.\nIf the AI train continues full steam ahead, maybe it's possible that OpenAI will be able to spend $300 billion on Oracle cloud compute resources over five years, as per the agreement. I don't believe that \"maybe\" will translate into reality, as OpenAI does not have $300 billion.\n\nPer Oracle, they expect to grow Cloud Infrastructure revenue \"...77% to $18 billion this fiscal year—and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.\" The majority of Oracle's promised revenue generation over the coming fiscal years is expected to be from OpenAI.\nFor this to happen, we need to assume that OpenAI has the money ready and that Oracle can finish its data centers in time. The first one is unthinkable, since OpenAI is falling behind other AI competitors and expects to be deep in the red until at least 2029. The latter argument is already crumbling, with Oracle delaying \"some\" data center projects for OpenAI to 2028.\nWhat you're actually betting on, and why I wouldn't take the bet Buying Oracle stock is now essentially a bet on OpenAI and its commitments. I do not believe that OpenAI will be able to buy $300 billion worth of compute over the agreement period. OpenAI won't be on the hook and can cancel or downsize the agreement, with Oracle's shareholders taking most of the blow.\n\nWeather, extreme demand, and finicky data center funding will inevitably push deadlines, too.\nIf you do want to bet on AI and data centers, you're better off buying Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , or Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) instead. They aren't as dependent on RPO figures from one startup.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

ADBE’s Firefly, Express and Creative Cloud applications currently integrate models from partners, including Google, OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, Luma, Runway, Topaz Labs and Eleven Labs.\n\nAdobe’s launch of Premiere Mobile in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 strengthened its footprint as a leading provider of next-generation AI video editing. The company announced a partnership with Google and YouTube, which is helping creators receive Adobe Premiere’s video editing tools in a new content creation space called Create for YouTube Shorts at the Premiere mobile app. Expansion of ad network partnerships with Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Snap and TikTok is a key catalyst for Adobe.\n\nThe company has recently entered into a strategic partnership with Runaway, where ADBE will utilize Runaway’s video technology, along with its own creative tools, to develop the next generation of video workflows. Adobe will be Runaway’s preferred API creativity partner, which will help ADBE’s customers get access to Runaway’s latest models. Its latest models, including Runaway’s new GEN-4.5, which are available only in Adobe Firefly, will be available to all ADBE’s clients.\n\nApart from an expanding partner base, Adobe’s strategy of infusing AI into its portfolio is driving growth, as reflected by the fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. Adobe exited the year with annual recurring revenues (ARR) of $25.2 billion, indicating 11.5% year-over-year growth, and management expects it to continue to rise to $25.6 at the end of fiscal 2026. The Semrush acquisition is expected to further boost Adobe’s ARR growth.\n\nAdobe Faces Tough Competition in the AI Domain ADBE’s AI business is minuscule compared with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in the AI Copilot business. Microsoft now has 900 million monthly active users of AI features across its products, with over 150 million monthly active users of first-party Copilots. More than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, with major customers deploying tens of thousands of seats.\n\nAlphabet’s focus on leveraging AI to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search and Google Cloud. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries. AI Mode is now available in more than 40 languages globally and has more than 75 million daily active users. GOOGL added 100 improvements to AI Mode in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nADBE’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Adobe shares have lost 21.6% in a year, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 22.9% and the Zacks Computer Software industry’s appreciation of 6.3%.\nAdobe Stock Lags Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nADBE stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of C.\n\nIn terms of trailing price/book, Adobe shares are trading at a higher multiple of 12.71 compared with the broader sector’s 10.76.\nADBE Stock is Overvalued\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $6.28 billion, indicating 9.89% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at $5.86 per share, which has inched up by 19 cents over the past 60 days, suggesting 15.4% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdobe Inc.

      "Content": "ADBE vs. GOOGL: Which AI-Driven Tech Stock Has an Edge Now?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:36 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADBE\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nAdobe ADBE and Alphabet GOOGL are infusing artificial intelligence (AI) into their core offerings. While Adobe’s ongoing AI push has been helping in advancing the company’s footprint among business, creative and marketing professionals, Alphabet has been infusing AI into its Search and Cloud platform.\n\nAccording to IDC, investments in AI solutions and services are projected to yield a global cumulative impact of $22.3 trillion by 2030. This represents roughly 3.7% of the global Gross Domestic Product and bodes well for both Alphabet and Adobe stocks.\n\nHowever, Adobe or Alphabet, which has an edge right now?\n\nThe Case for Adobe Stock ADBE is benefiting from strong demand for AI-powered Creative Cloud Pro and Acrobat, as well as AI-first products, Firefly and Acrobat AI Assistant. The company now targets annualized recurring revenue growth of 10.2% for fiscal 2026, driven by an innovative AI-powered portfolio, expanding adoption of enterprises and a large market opportunity.\n\nAdobe has been focusing on strengthening its footprint among marketing professionals through the Adobe Experience platform and apps that power customer engagement and loyalty. GenStudio is strengthening Adobe’s footprint among marketers. Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and agentic web solutions, including LLM Optimizer, Sites Optimizer and Brand Concierge, are delivering brand visibility and discovery. The Semrush acquisition will enhance Adobe’s expanding portfolio of AI-driven customer experience solutions, including AEM, Adobe Analytics and Adobe Brand Concierge.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, Adobe expects total revenues between $25.9 billion and $26.1 billion. Adobe expects Business Professionals and Consumers’ subscription revenue between $7.35 billion and $7.4 billion. Creative and Marketing Professionals subscription revenues are expected to be between $17.75 billion and $17.9 billion.\n\nHowever, Adobe’s AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet. OpenAI, Salesforce, Midjourney and Canva are other major competitors.\n\nThe Case for Alphabet Stock Alphabet’s initiatives to infuse AI in Search and Google Cloud are noteworthy. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. In November, Alphabet launched Gemini 3, its latest state-of-the-art reasoning model. It now powers Search, via AI Mode. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in nearly 120 countries and territories in English can use Gemini 3 Pro by selecting “Thinking with 3 Pro” from the model drop-down menu in AI Mode.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding AI infrastructure is helping it win enterprise clients. Google Cloud Platform’s prospects remain robust, driven by strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs (led by seventh-generation Ironwood) and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for the latest Gemini and other AI models, and other services, including cybersecurity and data analytics. Google Cloud is also benefiting from strong Gen AI adoption due to leading models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues from products developed on Google’s Gen AI models surged more than 200% year over year.\n\nAccelerating spending on AI infrastructure bodes well for GOOGL stock. For 2025, Alphabet now expects to spend capital expenditures between $91 billion and $93 billion, up from the previous estimate of $85 billion. The company expects capital expenditure to increase significantly in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL Earnings Estimate Revision Steady, ADBE’s Goes South The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $10.58 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating a 31.6% increase over 2024’s reported figure.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nThe consensus mark for Adobe’s fiscal 2026 earnings has declined by nine cents to $23.44 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 12% growth over fiscal 2025.\n\nAdobe Inc. Price and Consensus Adobe Inc. price-consensus-chart | Adobe Inc. Quote\n\nBoth GOOGL’s and ADBE’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Alphabet’s average surprise of 18.74% is better than Adobe’s surprise of 2.25%, reflecting the good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.\n\nStock Price Performance & Valuation: ADBE vs. GOOGL Adobe shares have underperformed the Alphabet stock in a year. The ADBE stock dropped 20.9% while GOOGL surged 63% over the time frame.\nADBE and GOOGL Share Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBoth Alphabet and Adobe are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D and C, respectively.\n\nIn terms of forward 12-month price/sales, Alphabet shares are trading at 9.79X, higher than Adobe’s 5.65X.\nGOOGL and ADBE Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. However, Adobe is suffering from the negative impact of stiff competition in the AI and Generative AI space, offering GOOGL an edge.\n\nCurrently, Adobe and Alphabet carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

      "Content": "2 Stocks I'd Happily Hold Through Any Stock Market Crash\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Artificial intelligence (AI) competition has brought out the best in Alphabet.\nThe company has a big structural cost advantage that should continue to widen.\nAmazon, meanwhile, does not get enough credit for its leadership in robotics or its own custom AI chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWith the market near all-time highs and murmurs of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble and even a potential market crash, there are some stocks I still wouldn't sell.\nWhile I'm not expecting a big market pullback, let's look at two stocks I'd continue to hold and likely be buying more of if a crash were to happen.\n1. Alphabet I think Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is going to be one of the biggest long-term winners in AI. The reason is that AI is pushing the company to innovate, making its products better.\nI'd argue that OpenAI is actually one of the best things to happen to the stock. Before OpenAI came along, Alphabet was largely viewed as a great company, but one that was bloated and stagnant. However, competition not only brought out the best in Alphabet, but it also highlighted some of the tech innovations it had been working on behind the scenes.\n\nThe biggest of these behind-the-scenes innovations was its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Alphabet had been using and advancing these custom chips for more than a decade, but it wasn't until recently that investors began to see their importance. These chips give Alphabet a huge structural cost advantage, both within its cloud computing unit and also with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference. Now, even other companies are set to begin deploying Alphabet's chips at scale to run some of their AI workloads within Google Cloud.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has incorporated its Gemini model throughout its portfolio of products, making them better, which is driving revenue growth. Meanwhile, by incorporating AI into Google Search, Maps, and Gmail, as well as becoming an AI assistant with Android and soon Apple devices, the company is meeting people where they are active every day. That's just a huge advantage that will grow with time.\n\nRight now, Alphabet is in the midst of riding a virtuous cycle, given its vertical integration edge. That's why it's a stock to hold through any market crash.\n2. Amazon Like Alphabet, I really like what Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been doing behind the scenes. The company does not get nearly the credit it deserves in robotics, because it is using them in its own fulfillment centers to drive efficiency rather than selling them to generate revenue. But make no mistake: Amazon is one of the world's foremost companies in robotics.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company has more than 1 million robots in its distribution centers, all of which are coordinated by its DeepFleet AI model. These robots keep becoming more advanced and able to handle more complex tasks. Meanwhile, Amazon is also using AI to help reduce delivery times through optimizing routes, locating hard-to-find drop-off locations for drivers, and determining which warehouses are best to store certain items. This has been leading to strong operating leverage, with the company seeing its segment-adjusted operating income soar 28% last quarter on an 11% increase in revenue.\n\nAnd while its custom AI chips are not as battle-tested as Alphabet's, Amazon is also making strong inroads in this area, which should help power its cloud computing results moving forward. It built out a world-class data center for Anthropic using Amazon's Trainium chips, which is still ramping up. Meanwhile, Amazon has been in talks with OpenAI about taking a stake in the company, which would also see the LLM company start to deploy some of its chips for its workloads. The two companies agreed earlier on a seven-year, $38 billion AWS (Amazon Web Services) computing deal, but that would be powered by Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\nGiven its robotics and e-commerce leadership, combined with its position in cloud computing, Amazon looks like a long-term winner, whether the market crashes next year or not.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Those shares are now worth almost $700M.\nAST SpaceMobile successfully deployed BlueBird 6 on Wednesday. It is the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit.\nPlanet Labs ( PL ) reported record revenue of $81.3M in fiscal Q3. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672M.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAlphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) dominates the search engine market with over 90% share and powers billions of daily queries through Google Search. Its Google Cloud division has gained market share from leaders Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nA lesser-known aspect is Alphabet also directly invests in public companies through its venture arms GV and CapitalG. This portfolio held 38 stocks at the end of the third quarter with assets under management of about $2.5 billion and spanning sectors like healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI), and technology.\nYet there is one sector where Alphabet has placed its biggest bets: space. According to McKinsey, the space sector is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, so it's not surprising Alphabet is attempting to cash in on the explosive growth expected. What's notable about Alphabet's space investments is that it has concentrated its focus on just two stocks, which comprise 45% of the portfolio's AUM at current valuations.\n\nAST SpaceMobile ( NASDAQ:ASTS ) and Planet Labs ( NYSE:PL ) stand out as the largest positions in the portfolio, so let's see whether they warrant an investment from you, too.\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) AST SpaceMobile builds a space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by standard smartphones. Alphabet participated in a $155 million strategic investment round in early 2024 alongside AT&T ( NYSE:T ) and Vodafone ( NASDAQ:VOD ), supporting the company's satellite constellation development.\n\nGoogle collaborates on product development, testing, and implementation for network connectivity on Android devices. In the first quarter of 2025, Alphabet added 8.9 million shares valued at approximately $203 million. Today, those shares are worth almost $700 million and represent the portfolio's largest holding, or 23.3% of the total.\nAST achieved a key milestone on Wednesday with the successful launch and orbital deployment of BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit. This validates its technology for direct-to-device connectivity.\n\nStory Continues\nThe satellite stock's shares have surged 270% year-to-date as it advances its launch schedule and partnerships with over 50 mobile network operators serving billions of subscribers. The stock has been volatile, but has gained significant ground as it attained new milestones.\nAST SpaceMobile's focus on eliminating connectivity gaps aligns with the growth in satellite broadband, but analysts still give it mixed reviews. Some rate it a Buy for its long-term potential, while others are concerned about execution risks, limited revenue, and ongoing losses. Weiss Ratings , for example, just reiterated its Sell rating on the stock while Barclays downgraded it in October from Overweight to Underweight.\n\nAST SpaceMobile is probably best suited for risk-tolerant investors who may see an opportunity in it capturing even a slice of the projected $100 billion satellite broadband market.\nPlanet Labs (PL) Planet Labs operates a fleet of over 200 satellites providing daily global imagery and geospatial data for sectors including agriculture, defense, finance, and climate monitoring. Alphabet holds a roughly 10% stake, with data integrations supporting Google Earth and AI models for environmental analytics.\n\nAlphabet's position in Planet Labs is currently valued at approximately $650 million after the stock jumped following its fiscal year 2026 Q3 earnings report, making it the portfolio's second-largest holding. The valuation is 56% above where it stood on the date of Alphabet's 13F-HR filing.\nPlanet Labs reported record quarterly revenue of $81.3 million, up 33% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672 million, driven by defense and intelligence contracts.\nThe space stock's shares have rocketed over 400% in 2025 following hefty earnings beats and analyst upgrades. Morgan Stanley hiked its price target from $4.50 to $20 per share, which suggests Planet Labs is fairly priced, but the consensus has a sub-$15 target, which is why the stock has a Hold rating overall.\n\nIn the expanding $1.8 trillion space economy by 2035, Planet Labs benefits from geospatial AI applications that should contribute to revenue growth outpacing the sector. Aggressive investors may view it as a thematic play, but most investors should probably wait for a more attractive entry point following its huge run-up.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\n\nNalak Das\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:38 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of the three above-mentioned stocks year to date.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon.com Inc. Global e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN’s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon’s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is “Growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\n\nExtensive AI Applications Amazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called “Project Rainier.” This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\n\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers’ queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\n\nStory continues\nAMZN’s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance Amazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft Corp. Microsoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT’s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company’s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT’s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength Microsoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN’s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT’s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\n\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc. The undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\n\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion.

This is the biggest transaction Nvidia has made so far to buy anything. The goal of the move is to make Nvidia more competitive in the quickly increasing market for AI hardware and data centers.The business will use Groq's specialized chip designs in future products and hire Jonathan Ross, the startup's CEO, and other top engineers. Ross was part of the team that started Google's own AI chip initiative.The deal is part of a larger wave of investments worth billions of dollars that are changing the AI infrastructure environment. Recently, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta, and Amazon have made big promises to increase their AI processing power and work with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and CoreWeave.Analysts argue that Nvidia's partnership with Groq will help it stay ahead of AMD, Intel, and bespoke chipmakers in the AI accelerator market by giving it access to more technologies.

      "Content": "AI Bubble Fears Scaring You Off? Buy This Magnificent 7 Stock for Stability.\n\nMohit Oberoi\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\n2025 is now drawing to a close, and while the broader markets are set to deliver double-digit returns for the third consecutive year, we saw a rotation of sorts. After leading the stock market rally from the front over the previous two years, the “Magnificent 7” stocks took a back seat. And if not for the 65% rise in Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), the group’s weighted average returns would have trailed that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX). While some Magnificent 7 names, particularly Nvidia (NVDA), delivered triple-digit returns in 2023 and 2024, this year none have found a way even into the top 25 gainers in the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX).\n\nBased on our perception of the technology, we may or may not term the 2025 price action as the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble bursting, but one thing was clear this year: investors are not buying into the ever-rising AI capex story and are increasingly getting worried about the toll they are taking on tech companies’ cash flows.\nMore News from Barchart As the FDA Approves a Wegovy Pill, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold Novo Nordisk Stock?\nThis Dividend Giant Yielding 4.5% Is Wall Street’s Top Telecom Pick for 2026\nHave a MERRY Christmas With These 9 Unusually Active Options\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nApple Might Have Underinvested in AI But things are not as straightforward, and just as markets are punishing companies for their overexuberance towards AI, underinvestment isn’t getting rewarded either, with Apple (AAPL) being a prime example.\nEver since the AI euphoria began in 2023, Apple has been trying to shed the perception that it is slacking on the technology even as other tech companies race ahead. This is not to say that the Tim Cook-led company is resting on its past laurels and has taken several measures to catch up. Among others, Apple has gradually added AI features to its iPhones as part of “Apple Intelligence” and plans to release the updated Siri next year.\n\nIt has increased its capex towards AI, and during the fiscal Q3 2025 earnings call in July, Cook said that Apple is “reallocating a fair number of people to focus on AI features within the company.” Without providing specifics, Cook discussed an “exciting road map ahead” for new AI products and did not rule out the possibility of a major acquisition to bolster its AI capabilities. I, however, have serious doubts about the company acquiring Perplexity, as was previously rumored, given their vastly different approaches to customer privacy.\n\nStory Continues\nPrivacy Has Been Apple’s USP Notably, one of the reasons Apple is running behind in AI is the company’s focus on privacy, which is atypical for AI that feeds on massive amounts of data. However, I believe it could be the company’s unique selling proposition (USP), as users concerned about AI companies snooping on their data would find solace in the Apple ecosystem, which prioritizes user privacy at its core.\n\nOverall, I would say that Apple took quite a balanced and measured approach towards AI, and while it did miss out on first-mover advantage, the Cupertino-based giant was never known for being one. Some of its most successful products, like the iPod, iPad, and iPhone, were launched when competitors were already offering competing products.\nApple’s Valuations Are Quite Rich Apple was never really a bet on AI, and the company’s efforts to capitalize on the technology, which is being touted as the next big thing since the internet, leave a lot to be desired. The company, however, took baby steps in a typical Apple way and is trying to improvise upon what others are doing—as the common adage about the company goes, “Apple doesn't need to be first. They just need to be the best.”\n\nThat said, Apple would be one name to double down on if you are worried about an AI bubble, as the stock never really benefited from the AI rally and is therefore at the least risk in a crash. Apple could be a bastion of safety and could see buying interest if the long-feared AI bubble bursts. Otherwise, I don’t see the stock outperforming the average Magnificent 7 peer by a significant margin in 2026. While strong expected sales of the iPhone 17 would keep sentiment buoyed, there is not much on the table at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of around 34x.\nAAPL Stock Forecast The consensus view is not overtly bullish for AAPL stock either, and it is rated as a “Moderate Buy” based on the consolidated ratings of 40 analysts tracked by Barchart . The stock’s mean target price of $290.85 is just about 7% higher than current price levels. Among its Magnificent 7 peers, only Tesla (TSLA) has a lower rating than Apple.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, GOOG.

After almost exactly nine years in my portfolio, my Alphabet Class A stock was up by 348%. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had gained 156% over the same period.\nBut I didn't rebalance this successful position. Now, those Alphabet shares have gained a total of 2,084% (or 2,096% if you include the minimal dividends the Google parent is paying nowadays). Every time I look at that chart, it reminds me of the classic Motley Fool Rule Breakers philosophy: Let winners keep winning.\nThis winner is winning again On that note, Alphabet is up to its old market-beating tricks again. The stock is up 66% over the last year, outperforming the other six members of the \" Magnificent Seven \" club. Many investors back away from showstopping gains like these, fearing that the greatest gains must be behind them.\n\nThe move since 2019 is just one piece of evidence that Alphabet has what it takes to continue growing, even from a $3.8 trillion market cap. It's a leading force in online search and advertising, artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, early quantum computing research, driverless taxi services...\nI could keep going, but you get the drift. Alphabet is winning in so many ways, it's kind of hard to keep track of all the trophies.\nThe best time to buy was yesterday In other words, it's not too late to buy Alphabet stock.\nImagine looking back at December 2025 from the end of 2030 or (even better!) 2040. You'll almost certainly be better off if you doubled down on Alphabet just below $330 per share than if you had sold it this winter. Yes, even if your stock position was up by thousands of percent already.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Stock Will Be the Biggest Quantum Computing Winner of 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nIONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nKey Points Upstarts like IonQ and Rigetti Computing have boom-or-bust potential in 2026.\nLegacy tech players like Alphabet have a greater chance of success.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nQuantum computing hype has gone through two separate boom-and-bust cycles in 2025. At the end of 2024, quantum computing investing was all the rage, thanks to a breakthrough announcement by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) that brought quantum computing into the mainstream. After these stocks rose rapidly in December 2024, they crashed immediately after entering 2025. Throughout the year, these stocks slowly gained momentum before crashing again around October.\n\nClearly, quantum computing stocks are quite volatile. Their performance is more closely tied to the market's appetite for risk rather than actual business performance, which can make finding the right time to purchase these stocks tricky. However, I think there's a better way to invest in quantum computing that may increase the chance of reaping profits during the next few years.\nFinding the ultimate quantum computing winner will be difficult There are two buckets of quantum computing stocks: Upstarts and legacy tech companies. Upstarts include companies like IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) , Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) , and D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) , which are completely devoted to producing viable quantum computing technology. They get their funding from various research contracts or by going to the public market to raise capital.\n\nThese stocks are incredibly risky, but would have a huge payoff if their technology pans out. The reality is that most of the publicly traded and private quantum computing start-ups will go bankrupt before viable quantum computing technology becomes available in roughly 2030.\nWhile some investors may have the risk tolerance for this type of investing, few do. As a result, I think most investors would be better off owning some legacy tech companies.\nCompanies in this cohort are pursuing quantum computing on the side as a complementary part of their business. This group includes companies like Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and IBM (NYSE: IBM) , among others. While these companies will benefit greatly from having in-house quantum computing available, it isn't critical to their success. As a result, these companies are far safer, as they have viable cash flows funding their quantum computing research. If they lost the race to develop useful quantum computing technology, their existing businesses would still be OK.\nI think most investors are better off picking a stock in this category, and I can think of few better than Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is one of the leaders in the quantum computing race Although you will hear announcements from the quantum computing start-ups quite often, you will only get updates from Alphabet on its quantum computing progress about once a year. This isn't because Alphabet is slow; it's because it doesn't need to broadcast all the breakthroughs it's making to sustain investor support.\n\nAlphabet's most recent announcement was significant, as it announced the first verifiable quantum computing advantage. Its Willow quantum computing chip ran an algorithm 13,000 times faster than the world's fastest supercomputer. While that's an incredible improvement, it's not so fast that the performance couldn't be independently verified. Furthermore, the algorithm it runs actually has real-world implications.\nThis algorithm can help scientists understand nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is the technology used in MRI scans. Alphabet may be closer to having a real-world effect than most realize, and its top-tier quantum computing technology is evidence of that.\nAlthough it's possible that some of the smaller quantum computing upstarts could get hot again in 2026, I'd prefer a more reliable bet like Alphabet. Alphabet has a lot going for it, with a leading generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, a strong base business (Google Search), and a thriving cloud computing wing. All this combines to make Alphabet a great investment in 2026, and if it can deliver more quantum computing breakthroughs, that will be a cherry on top.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "What Is the Smartest Quantum Computing Stock to Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nQBTS\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Pure-play developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are the hottest quantum computing stocks right now.\nBig tech giants are also exploring quantum computing in addition to their established generative artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nNvidia is quietly building a quantum AI ecosystem that stands to benefit, no matter which systems succeed in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOne of the hottest pockets of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm in 2025 was quantum computing. Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

(NASDAQ: BIDU ) is one of the best rising tech stocks to buy now .\nPhoto by Samuele Errico Piccarini on Unsplash\nA significant escalation in the global race toward autonomous mobility occurred on December 22, 2025, when Uber and Lyft announced partnerships with Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) to launch driverless taxi trials in the UK in 2026. This partnership will see Baidu’s Apollo Go RT6 robotaxis enter London’s ride-hailing networks in 2026. With these rapid developments, the stage will be set for the first head-to-head competition between U.S. and Chinese autonomous driving leaders in a major European capital. This update comes shortly after Alphabet’s Waymo began supervised testing in the city.\n\nThe UK’s appeal as a testing ground has grown recently, with the Automated Vehicles Act 2024 clarifying liability by shifting responsibility from passengers to authorized self-driving operators. The region now offers regulatory certainty largely absent across the European Union.\nMeanwhile, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)’s broader autonomous strategy has drawn investor attention, with Citi placing the stock on a 90-day positive catalyst watch on December 8, 2025. The investment bank cited improving disclosure around AI-driven revenues and Ernie model investments as potential value unlocks. Citi reiterated its “Buy” rating on the stock with an $181 price target, citing growing confidence in the company’s outlook after meeting with management.\nOn December 7, 2025, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was one of ARK’s biggest additions, with the investment firm acquiring 119,982 Baidu shares worth $14.24 million. This follows the firm’s cautious stance on Chinese stocks for most of 2025.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) provides internet search and online marketing solutions. It is known for the Baidu App, Baidu Search, Baidu Feed, Haokan, Quanmin, Baidu Post Bar, Baidu Knows, and many other products.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of BIDU as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 To Avoid\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:56 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nUNH\n\nAXP\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Lots of investors don’t recognize just how important the credit card company American Express is to Berkshire Hathaway.\nThere was a time when Alphabet would have never even been allowed to become part of Berkshire's portfolio.\nHealth insurer UnitedHealth Group’s challenges are much greater than the company-specific ones.\n10 stocks we like better than American Express ›\n\nWith Warren Buffett's 55-year tenure as Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and chief stock-picker set to come to a close at the end of this year, plenty of investors are understandably disappointed. After all, they'll no longer be able to copy the occasional pick from the Oracle of Omaha's market-beating portfolio. If you're looking for an idea you know for sure is a Buffett-approved pick, you'd better act soon before these stock-selection duties are passed on to his successor.\nStill, it's not like Buffett's been perfect. Even he acknowledges he makes the occasional investing misstep.\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at a couple of current Berkshire holdings that would likely work for your portfolio as well, and one name Warren Buffett recently bought that you might not want to ... at least not yet, and maybe never.\nA stock to buy: American Express Given how infrequently it's highlighted as a Buffett pick, many investors are surprised to learn that credit card powerhouse American Express (NYSE: AXP) is Berkshire Hathaway's second-biggest stock trade; the position is worth nearly $58 billion and accounts for more than 18% of the conglomerate's portfolio. Even more telling is that it's also one of Berkshire's longest-held undisturbed holdings. Whereas Buffett's been steadily paring back supersized stakes in Apple and Bank of America , Berkshire's 151.6 million shares in American Express are the same number of shares it has owned since first buying it back in 2006. This speaks volumes about long-term confidence in the company.\n\nThat being said, it's not difficult to understand why Buffett is such a big fan.\nWhile not as big as Visa or Mastercard, nor growing as quickly as either one right now, AmEx caters to more affluent consumers who aren't really rattled by economic headwinds. The company's third-quarter revenue growth accelerated to a year-over-year pace of nearly 11%, coming in at a little over $18.4 billion versus analysts' estimates of only $18.05 billion. Then, in early December, American Express reported a 9% year-over-year increase in consumer spending during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, with its wealthiest cardholders pumping up their spending even more, proving the card company's resilience.\n\nStory Continues\nDo you know that AXP shares are one of Wall Street's few stocks presently trading above their consensus target price, prompting some interested investors to balk. That's why it wouldn't be completely crazy to see if a better price becomes available in the near future.\nJust don't let discipline turn into stubbornness. This is one of those cases where a ticker's price leads its consensus target just as much as it's led by it.\nIn other words, don't sweat the ho-hum consensus too much. Instead, just focus on the consistent quality of American Express's business, as Buffett does. The premium you're paying for it eventually ends up paying for itself.\nA stock to buy: Alphabet Just a few years ago, the idea of Berkshire Hathaway taking on a position in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was unthinkable. Buffett's simply never been a big fan of technology stocks, saying he didn't understand them well enough to assess them.\nSomething's clearly changed in the meantime, though. While Berkshire's stake in Google's parent is a modest 17.8 million shares worth only $5.6 billion, the fact that Buffett's allowed any -sized piece of this tech outfit into the portfolio is actually a pretty big deal ... even if it was likely mostly encouraged by one of his stock-picking lieutenants.\n\nThe thing is, this pick actually makes good sense even if it's not quite the Oracle of Omaha's typical fare. Google's share of the global search engine market is holding firm at 90%, according to Statcounter, while its Android operating system is installed on more than 70% of the world's mobile devices. And, while Synergy Research Group reports that Google's piece of the worldwide cloud computing market is a fairly modest 13% versus Amazon 's 29% and Microsoft 's 20%, Google's share is growing faster than that of its two top rivals, with its revenue improving 33% year over year last quarter.\nIt's still not always an easy business to understand, particularly for anyone who isn't digitally native (or at least familiar with consumer-facing technologies due to regular usage of them). It's not difficult to understand, however, that Alphabet is investment-worthy not just because it offers a handful of marketable products, but because this company was built from the ground up to remain ready, willing, and able to adapt to an ever-changing technological landscape.\n\nA stock to avoid: UnitedHealth Group Finally, while the superficial logic of the pick makes enough sense, Berkshire's recent addition of health insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) to its stock portfolio may not be one you want to follow.\nThe chief motivation here is the discounted price on shares of a seemingly stable company. From April's share price peak near $605 to August's trough of less than $235 -- more than a 60% setback -- stemming from combination of unexpectedly high reimbursement costs, a DOJ investigation into its Medicare billing practices, and the surprising resignation of UnitedHealth's CEO Andrew Witty in May, it felt like all the bad news that could be baked in had been baked in. And, perhaps it was.\n\nThere's a bigger secular headwind blowing against the entire health insurance industry, however, that's not going to be overcome with new leadership or tighter control of the company's operation. That's a nationwide effort to keep consumers' healthcare costs contained. The White House recently inked deals with nine different pharmaceutical companies to lower Americans' drug prices, for instance, and unless something changes, the impending end to subsidies called for by the Affordable Care Act could ultimately undermine demand for UnitedHealth's ACA coverage plans. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice's scrutiny of UnitedHealth's Medicare billing is a microcosm of the frustration with the entire healthcare industry's ever-growing lack of regulatory accountability. All of it works against the company.\n\nSure, UnitedHealth may well (and likely will) push through whatever the future holds. As it stands right now, though, there's too much risk and too much uncertainty for too little upside to justify holding this name. More clarity is needed, and that's going to take more time than has been given.

      "Content": "Dan Ives Loves This Under-the-Radar AI Stock for 2026\n\nNauman Khan\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nWhen investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, individuals tend to focus on the large, mega-cap stocks that are all the rage, yet the next wave of AI may more comfortably benefit smaller infrastructure businesses. As capital shifts from model development to deployment, people are demanding more cloud capacity, superior compute power, and AI-ready data centers, making the demand hot.\n\nOne quietly notable name that has been catching Wall Street's eye is Nebius (NBIS). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives just listed NBIS as his top AI infrastructure pick for 2026, arguing the company’s positioning and tech make it a likely acquisition target for a hyperscaler such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), or Amazon (AMZN).\nMore News from Barchart Super Micro Computer Stock Tumbles, But Investors are Piling into Its Call Options - Time to Buy SMCI?\nA $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\nRKLB Stock Bullish Diagonal Trade Targets a Price of $85 by January 16th\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nFor investors looking beyond the obvious AI leaders, here’s a closer look at why NBIS is drawing bullish attention heading into 2026.\nAbout NBIS Stock Based in Amsterdam, Nebius provides full-stack cloud and GPU-accelerated AI infrastructure across Europe and North America. It builds sustainable data centers and rents AI‑optimized compute clusters with liquid cooling and high‑power GPUs to hyperscalers and enterprises. The company emerged from a restructuring of the former Yandex infrastructure business and now combines its core AI cloud service with subsidiaries in autonomous vehicles and education technology.\n\nValued at around $23 billion by market cap, NBIS stock has been stellar this year. After languishing post-restructuring, the shares rallied over the summer, in part when Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed a stake in the company, peaking above $140 by October. A surge in new contracts with tech giants, such as Microsoft and Meta (META), further fueled investor enthusiasm. Until now, Nebius has gained roughly 225% year-to-date (YTD), despite a pullback from the recent high.\nThat performance comes with clear trade-offs. Nebius now trades at valuation levels that leave little room for error. Its trailing price-to-sales multiple sits in the mid-50s, far above the sector median, which trades closer to 4x, and its own 5-year historical average, which sits at 24x.\nIn short, the market is pricing Nebius as a future cornerstone of AI infrastructure. That may prove correct, but it also means any slowdown in contract growth, pricing pressure, or capital-spending misstep could weigh heavily on the stock. At today’s levels, execution matters as much as vision.\n\nStory Continues\nImpact of Ives’ Acquisition Thesis Dan Ives’s endorsement, calling Nebius “ripe” for a 2026 acquisition by a hyperscaler, gave the stock a short-term boost. The day his comments were publicized, NBIS spiked about 14% following the news. Investors interpreted it as validation of Nebius’s strategic value. Ives specifically noted that among AI “neocloud” firms, Nebius is the most likely buyout candidate, which fueled positive sentiment.\n\nFor the company, this means fresh investor interest and higher trading volume, though it’s too early to say if any deal is imminent. In the near term, the news underscores Nebius’s industry stature; if true, a 2026 deal could be transformative. But even absent an actual acquisition, the hype helps spotlight Nebius’s core business and contracts, potentially improving access to capital.\nNebius Delivered Solid Revenue Yet Widened Losses Nebius delivered a strong quarter in Q3 2025, posting revenue of $146.1 million, up 355% year-over-year (YoY), as demand for AI infrastructure surged and large new contracts came online. This growth was largely driven by strong uptake across its core AI infrastructure business, which now accounts for the vast majority of results.\n\nProfitability, however, remains a work in progress. Nebius reported a GAAP net loss of $119.6 million, wider than a year earlier, reflecting aggressive expansion and rising depreciation tied to new data center capacity. But there was a bright spot below the surface. Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed sharply to $5.2 million, a significant improvement from nearly $46 million last year, as higher revenue began to offset operating expenses.\nOn the other side, spending ramped up sharply as the company accelerated its buildout. Operating cash burn rose to $80.6 million, while capital expenditures jumped to nearly $1.0 billion in the quarter, underscoring how capital-intensive AI infrastructure has become. Even so, Nebius ended the period with a formidable $4.8 billion cash balance, supported by recent equity and debt raises, giving it ample firepower to execute its growth plans.\n\nLooking ahead, management remains aggressive. Nebius is targeting an annualized revenue run rate of $750 million to $1 billion by the end of 2025 and plans to scale connected power capacity to 800 to 1,000 megawatts by 2026, with even more capacity already under contract.\nCEO Arkady Volozh has said the company has effectively sold out its existing capacity, with future capacity already pre-committed. While losses are expected to persist in the near term, the strategy is clear: scale first, optimize later.\nRecent Developments Since the quarter's close, Nebius has continued to make headlines. On Dec. 17, it launched Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 featuring Nvidia’s new Blackwell ultra-power GPUs. The company said it is now “ the first cloud in Europe to operate ” these cutting-edge Nvidia GB300 and HGX B300 systems in production, a technical milestone for customers.\n\nNebius also highlighted its $3 billion AI infrastructure agreement with Meta (announced in September) as a revenue backlog boost. These announcements were viewed positively as further proof of Nebius’s scale and partnerships.\nAnalyst's Perspective on NBIS Stock Wall Street remains broadly positive on NBIS stock, though analysts are clear about the risks. Goldman Sachs reiterated a “Buy” rating in November 2025 and raised its 12-month price target to $155, citing accelerating demand for AI infrastructure and improving visibility on large-scale contracts.\nSimilarly, D.A. Davidson also maintained a “Buy” with a $150 target, while CICC initiated coverage at $143, pointing to Nebius’ growing role in global AI compute buildouts.\n\nTaken together, on average, the rating given by analysts is “Moderate Buy,” and the broader consensus sits at about $150, which implies roughly 70% upside potential, which shows analysts' confidence in Nebius’ growth trajectory rather than near-term profitability.\nHowever, that optimism comes with caveats. Analysts consistently highlight Nebius’ rapid revenue growth and ability to secure large enterprise deals, but many also flag valuation as demanding. The investment case assumes smooth execution, disciplined capital spending, and sustained customer demand. Any stumble could weigh heavily on NBIS stock.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

With power now restored, we want to share an account of our operations during the outage and how we are evolving to better serve the city. The scale of the outage and the sheer number of disabled traffic lights were the primary contributors to city-wide gridlock. As signals went dark across major corridors, the resulting congestion required law enforcement to manually manage intersections. The situation was severe enough that the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management advised residents to stay home, underscoring the extraordinary nature of the weekend’s disruptions. Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology. While the Waymo Driver is designed to handle dark traffic signals as four-way stops, it may occasionally request a confirmation check to ensure it makes the safest choice. While we successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday, the outage created a concentrated spike in these requests. This created a backlog that, in some cases, led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets. We established these confirmation protocols out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment, and we are now refining them to match our current scale. While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the Driver with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.”\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump, giving Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:03 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 a.m. Pacific Time on Aug. 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia, AMD, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\n\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThe transition to Tan comes as Intel is in the middle of an announced $28 billion project to construct microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany . While the factories were originally slated to begin operations this year, that has been delayed to 2030 at the earliest as Intel seeks buyers for the chips those factories are to produce .\n\nStory Continues\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 minutes in the Oval Office Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms - Walden International and Walden Catalyst - did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies, including coming to Intel's formal groundbreaking ceremony in Licking County in 2022 .\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nIntel's venture capitalist CEO Born in Malaysia to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger , and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA 'lifeline' for Intel So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI\n\nOihyun Kim\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:53 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nBLK\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVIDIA has agreed to pay approximately $20 billion to acquire assets from artificial intelligence chip startup Groq, marking the company's largest transaction on record and continuing its strategy of absorbing potential competitors before they can challenge its market dominance.\nThe chipmaker's latest licensing deal mirrors a similar transaction just three months ago, reinforcing the narrative that decentralized AI infrastructure may offer the only alternative to Nvidia's growing dominance.\n\nThreefold Premium in Three Months with Trump Jr. Connection The deal closed just three months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation—a round that included BlackRock, Samsung, Cisco, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. serves as a partner. Nvidia is acquiring all of the company's assets substantially, except its cloud computing business, though Groq framed the transaction as a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"\n\nGroq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who helped create the search giant's Tensor Processing Unit, will join Nvidia along with president Sunny Madra and other senior executives. The startup will continue operating independently under CFO Simon Edwards as its new chief executive.\nA Repeating Playbook The Groq transaction follows a pattern Nvidia established just three months earlier. In September, the company paid over $900 million to hire Enfabrica's CEO and employees while licensing the startup's technology. Both deals use licensing structures rather than outright acquisitions, potentially avoiding the antitrust scrutiny that blocked Nvidia's $40 billion bid for Arm Holdings in 2022.\nThe Kobeissi Letter summarized Nvidia's approach bluntly: \"We will buy you before you can compete with us.\"\n\nTechnical Edge and Competitive Pressure Groq's Language Processing Unit uses on-chip SRAM rather than external DRAM, enabling what the company claims is up to 10x better energy efficiency. This architecture excels at real-time inference but limits model size—a tradeoff Nvidia can now explore within its broader ecosystem.\nThe timing is notable. Google recently unveiled its seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood, and released Gemini 3, trained entirely on TPUs, to top benchmark rankings. Nvidia responded on X: \"We're delighted by Google's success... NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model.\" When incumbents start issuing such reassurance statements, competitive pressure is clearly mounting.\n\nStory Continues\nImplications for Decentralized AI While the deal has no direct impact on cryptocurrency markets, it reinforces the narrative driving decentralized AI computing projects. Platforms like io.net position themselves as alternatives to centralized AI infrastructure.\n\"People can put their own supply onto a network, whether that's data centers or yourself with your laptop, contributing your available GPU power, and getting fairly compensated for it using tokenomics,\" Jack Collier, io.net's Chief Growth Officer, told BeInCrypto. The platform claims enterprise clients, including Leonardo.ai and UC Berkeley, have achieved significant cost savings.\n\nHowever, the gap between narrative and reality remains wide. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq's low-latency technology further extends its technical lead, making it harder for any alternative to offer competitive performance.\nThe transaction also raises questions about independent AI chip development. Cerebras Systems, another Nvidia competitor preparing an IPO, may eventually face similar pressure. Whether it can remain independent or succumb to Nvidia's financial gravity remains to be seen.\nRead original story Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI by Oihyun Kim at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In an interview with Benzinga, Freedom Capital Markets Chief Market Strategist Jay Woods shares his favorite Magnificent 7 stocks heading into 2026 and which of the seven he's avoiding.\n\nFavorite Magnificent 7 Stocks During an interview with Benzinga in September 2025, Woods said to stick with what was working when it came to big tech stocks and the Magnificent 7 stocks heading into the fourth quarter.\nOne of the big tech stocks that shone bright in the fourth quarter is a favorite for Woods heading into 2026.\n\"I love Alphabet over the long term. That's one you put away,\" Woods told Benzinga.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nWoods said Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) was previously caught up in antitrust litigation, which may have hurt the story.\n\"Look at what the stock has done.\"\nWoods said that while the stock has rallied in the fourth quarter, the company could still be undervalued, highlighting the potential for Waymo and the undervaluation of the company's YouTube asset.\n\"That growth continues at an alarming rate.\"\nAnother Magnificent 7 stock Woods highlighted for 2026 is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ).\n\n\"I think Tesla's a story to watch in 2026.\"\nWoods said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk survived Washington, D.C., and came out of a social media battle with President Donald Trump \"unscathed.\"\nThe market expert highlights Musk's new pay package and the history he has with beating metrics for compensation that many people view as significantly challenging.\n\"He had a pay package that he hit all metrics when it came to EV sales.\"\nWoods said Musk's new incentives include robotics, market capitalization and autonomous driving.\nTesla stock also looks strong heading into 2026 on technical levels, Woods told Benzinga, highlighting a breakout on the one-year chart.\n\"When you break out and now are going into a new year with momentum and you have a leader like Musk who's incentivized for the stock to do well, this is the fuel you want to see.\"\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nWoods said Tesla stock has technical setups, momentum and a leader focused on hitting incentives heading into the new year.\n\nStory Continues\nThe market expert highlights the $420 level for Tesla stock, a \"great number in Musk World,\" along with support at $460 as potential downside levels to watch. Woods sees Tesla stock potentially trading in the mid-$600s, which would provide around a 33% gain from current levels.\n\"I think a $666 target because we like fun numbers with Elon Musk is achievable given the trajectory that this stock is on both technically and the fundamental possibilities behind him focusing on his job.\"\n\nLeast Favorite Magnificent 7 Stocks While Woods has his eyes set on Alphabet and Tesla among the Magnificent 7 stocks for 2026, there are a few of the seven stocks he's avoiding.\n\"Meta is a stock that is now in a downtrend, a stock that has put so much money and emphasis into its spend and we're not seeing the benefits from it,\" Woods said.\n\nWoods said that while he loves what Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is doing with Instagram, the stock has broken down technically as it fails to get back above its 200-day moving average.\n\"They need to show results on this next quarterly report.\"\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate— Get Institutional Access Yourself\nThe market expert told Benzinga that Meta stock \"has more downside risk.\"\nWoods also sees some risk for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ) shares heading into 2026.\n\"Microsoft is another one. Topping formation developing there and it's got me a little concerned.\"\nThe market expert said that $475 is the level to watch and if Microsoft breaks below that level, there could be a \"significant leg lower.\"\n\nWoods also told Benzinga that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is a stock to watch for underperformance in 2026 among the Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\"Nvidia will have a good year. I just don't know if we're going to see that explosive growth to the upside from a stock performance point of view.\"\nIn his weekly newsletter , Woods recently predicted that semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia could stall in 2026 and take a step back. Woods told Benzinga that while it’s not a Magnificent Seven stock, he prefers Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU ) to Nvidia in 2026.\n\nNot making the cut for favorite or least favorite Magnificent 7 stocks by Woods were Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ).\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "This Dividend-Yielding Tech Stock Looks a ‘Compelling Buy’ for 2026 After 2 Years of Underperformance\n\nMohit Oberoi\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:30 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nWith year-to-date (YTD) gains of just about 15%, Microsoft (MSFT) is underperforming both the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX). The Satya Nadella-led company underperformed last year as well, and its gains of 12% in 2024 paled in comparison to its tech peers as well as the broader markets.\nIncidentally, the “Magnificent 7,” which led the market rally from the front in 2023 and 2024, did not have the best of years, and none of them made it to the list of top 20 gainers in the S&P 500 Index in 2025. The group’s collective price action has been below par, and only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are outperforming their average S&P 500 Index peer by a noticeable margin. Meanwhile, after the 2025 underperformance, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities—a known perma tech bull—sees MSFT stock rising to $625 next year and termed it a “compelling buy.” Notably, while tech stocks aren’t really known for their dividends and many don’t pay one in the first place, Microsoft’s dividend yield of 0.75% is the highest among Magnificent 7 stocks. It is on the verge of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nThis Dividend Stock Just Scored an FDA Win.

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWhy Did Microsoft Underperform in 2025? Microsoft’s 2025 underperformance has largely been due to concerns over its burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) capex. The company, which previously said that its capex growth would fall in the fiscal year 2026, now sees it going up instead. The Windows parent splurged almost $35 billion towards capex in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which ended in September, a record for the company.\n\nTo be sure, rising AI capex is not a Microsoft thing, and Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet have also bumped up spending amid the AI arms race. Barring Alphabet, which entered 2025 with tepid expectations and ended up impressing with its financial performance, the other three are underperforming this year. I find an Alphabet connection to Microsoft’s underperformance. While Gemini gaining ground at OpenAI’s cost helped propel GOOG stock higher, it put pressure on Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s biggest investor and a proxy play on the world’s most valuable unlisted startup.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft Stock's 2026 Forecast Despite the 2025 underperformance, the analyst community is not giving up on Microsoft, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 48 analysts polled by Barchart . MSFT stock trades even below the Street-low target price of $490, while the mean target price of $629.23 is almost 30% higher than current price levels.\n\nNotably, Ives’ target price of $625 is similar to the consensus price target and the same as Wolfe Research, which lowered MSFT’s target price by $50 earlier this month. Looking at the recent action, DA Davidson and Jefferies maintained their bullish bets on Microsoft this month while maintaining their respective target prices of $675 and $650.\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy for 2026? I remain constructive on MSFT stock heading into 2026. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30.6x, which I find balanced. The P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiples do look a bit ugly at 1.82x, but that’s got to do with AI capex hitting the company’s profits in the form of higher capex. “Big Short” Michael Burry’s controversial views on tech companies’ inflating the useful life of AI chips notwithstanding, companies like Microsoft are set to face higher depreciation expenses over the next couple of years.\n\nThere is a lot to like about Microsoft at these levels, though. The stock is a defensive play with a well-diversified business. The company’s Windows and Office business would continue to benefit from the uptick in PC sales, led by an aging base of installed devices and the advent of AI PCs. The ending of Windows 10 support would also help keep that segment buoyed, as more users would feel urged to upgrade to Windows 11.\nMoreover, AI is fueling demand for subscriptions, which would add to Microsoft’s topline. The cloud business is particularly growing at a brisk pace, and Microsoft is closing the gap with market leader Amazon. Specifically, during their recent earnings call, Microsoft said that its commercial cloud remaining performance obligations (RPO) soared 50% to $400 billion at the end of September, with a weighted average duration of just two years.\nOverall, while I haven’t been a permabull on MSFT, I have used the dips to add to my positions, something I repeated this time around as well. At these levels, I find MSFT stock a decent buy and see it delivering double-digit returns next year.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: MSFT, GOOG, NVDA, AMZN, META.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk weighed in on an AI debate, siding with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis after Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: META ) outgoing AI chief Yann LeCun dismissed the idea of \"general intelligence\" as an illusion.\n\nMusk Weighs In On AGI Debate Musk amplified Hassabis' rebuttal to LeCun in a post on X , writing simply, \"Demis is right,\" throwing his support behind the DeepMind chief in a widening public dispute over whether artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a meaningful concept.\nThe exchange underscores growing divisions among leading AI researchers over how intelligence should be defined — and whether human intelligence itself can be considered \"general.\"\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nHassabis Says Brains Are Fundamentally General Hassabis pushed back strongly against LeCun's statement that there is \"no such thing as general intelligence,\" arguing that LeCun is conflating general intelligence with the idea of universal intelligence.\nIn a detailed post, Hassabis said human brains are among the most complex systems known and are, by design, highly general learning machines.\n\nWhile acknowledging that no real-world system can escape some degree of specialization, he said the architecture of the human brain — much like modern AI foundation models — is capable of learning any computable task in theory, given sufficient time, memory and data.\nHe added that humanity's ability to invent chess, science and modern engineering, despite evolving for survival tasks like hunting and gathering, demonstrates the breadth of human intelligence rather than its limits.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nLeCun Calls Humans Extremely Specialized LeCun also responded to Hassabis' criticism, saying the disagreement is largely semantic.\n\nStory continues\nHe objected to equating \"general\" with \"human-level,\" arguing that humans are deeply specialized systems optimized for efficiency in narrow domains.\nWhile conceding that the human brain is theoretically Turing complete, LeCun said it is highly inefficient for most computational problems under real-world constraints.\nHe also argued that the brain can represent only a vanishingly small fraction of all possible functions, making true generality impossible in practice.\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

While Nvidia dominates the market for training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\nNvidia has agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology, Groq said. It said its founder Jonathan Ross, who helped Google start its AI chip program, as well as Groq ⁠President Sunny Madra and other members of its ‌engineering team, will join Nvidia.\nA person close to Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither ‍Nvidia nor Groq commented on the report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\n\nIn similar recent deals, Microsoft 's top AI executive came through a $650 million deal with a startup that ​was billed as a licensing fee, and Meta spent $15 billion to hire Scale AI's CEO without acquiring the entire firm. Amazon ‌hired away founders from Adept AI, and Nvidia did a similar deal this year. The deals have faced scrutiny by regulators, though none has yet been unwound.\n\"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive (even as Groq’s leadership and, we would presume, technical talent move over to Nvidia),\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday after Groq's announcement. And Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's \"relationship with the Trump administration appears among the strongest of ⁠the key US tech companies.\"\n\nGroq more than doubled its valuation to $6.9 billion from $2.8 ​billion in August last year, following a $750 million funding round in September.\nGroq is ​one of a number of upstarts that do not use external high-bandwidth memory chips, freeing them from the memory crunch affecting the global chip industry. The approach, which uses a form of on-chip memory called SRAM, helps ‍speed up interactions with chatbots and ⁠other AI models but also limits the size of the model that can be served.\n\nStory continues\nGroq's primary rival in the approach is Cerebras Systems, which Reuters this month reported plans to go public as soon as next year. Groq and Cerebras have ⁠signed large deals in the Middle East.\nNvidia's Huang spent much of his biggest keynote speech of 2025 arguing that Nvidia would be able to maintain its lead as ‌AI markets shift from training to inference.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese ‌in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Matthew Lewis and William Mallard)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Next year is seen as potentially heralding both a solid number of new offerings, and some big ones.\nNext year is expected to be a busy year for IPOs—and to include some potentially massive offerings. Tech firms expected to file next year include Elon Musk's SpaceX , OpenAI and Anthropic . Renaissance Capital in its 2026 outlook for IPOs estimated some 200 of them next year, raising as much as $60 billion.\n\n\"We expect to see the past year’s uptick in venture-backed issuance to continue, particularly as more AI-related companies mature and seek to tap into growing demand from public investors,\" Renaissance wrote. \"Themes like fintech, healthtech, digital assets, and defense should carry into the coming year.\"\nSan Francisco-based Motive, whose Series F convertible preferred stock owners include Alphabet's ( GOOGL ) Google Ventures, said revenue for the nine months through Sept. 30 rose 22% year-over-year to $327 million.

The outage on Dec. 20, which cut electricity to nearly one-third of the city, was caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas and Electric Company substation and led to widespread traffic congestion as signals went dark across large parts of the city.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AMD.\nIs GOOG fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nWaymo said it will roll out fleetwide updates designed to help vehicles better navigate large-scale outages, alongside expanded engagement with first responders and updates to its emergency response protocols. While the driver system already treats dark traffic lights as four-way stops, it can request confirmation checks to ensure it is making the safest decision. During the outage, Waymo said a concentrated spike in these requests created backlogs and response delays, even though its vehicles handled more than 7,000 dark traffic signals.\nThe company said these confirmation protocols were put in place early in its deployment out of caution and were effective during smaller outages. By giving the system specific power-outage context, Waymo said the new updates could allow its vehicles to operate more decisively in similar situations going forward, a step that could be viewed by investors as part of Alphabet's effort to improve reliability as autonomous operations expand in dense urban environments.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Indeed, it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which a formal partnership between AAPL and GOOG would boost AAPL stock much at all. As a result, I would not recommend that investors buy the company’s shares based on Ives’ prediction.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\n$800 for Tesla Stock Could Be Reality in 2026. Here’s Why.\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nAbout AAPL Stock Primarily due to the iPhone’s popularity and its high gross margins, Apple is one of the most profitable companies in the world. In the 12 months that ended in September, it generated income of $112 billion. Consequently, its market capitalization, which stands at about $4.04 trillion, is huge.\nOn the other hand, AAPL stock has lagged many of its Big Tech peers in recent years. In the last 12 months, the shares are up only about 7%, while they have gained 42% in the last two years. Conversely, GOOG, for example, has jumped about 60% in the last year and roughly 121% in the last two years.\nOne issue weighing on AAPL stock is the company’s inability so far to generate a great deal of revenue from the AI revolution.\nAAPL’s top line increased 8% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $102.5 billion, and it has a trailing price-earnings ratio of 36.3 times.\nWhy a Potential Partnership With GOOG Probably Won’t Move the Needle Much for AAPL Stock Ives indicated that AAPL’s market capitalization would be lifted by almost 25% by charging subscription fees for its AI offering. But Microsoft’s (MSFT) experience with its AI assistant, CoPilot, for which it charges some users subscription fees, strongly indicates that Ives’ vision is unrealistic. Specifically, in a post updated last month, Business of Apps reported that “Microsoft Copilot had 33 million active users across Windows, app and website.” Moreover, the website believes that MSFT’s entire AI business generated “about $400 million direct revenue in 2024.”\n\nStory Continues\nEvery CoPilot user does not pay subscription fees. But even if we assume that Apple was able to quickly obtain as many users as CoPilot has and they all paid a $10 per month fee, the resulting revenue would not move the needle for AAPL stock. Under the latter scenario, AAPL would generate slightly under $4 billion of annual revenue from the offering, versus its total revenue for its last fiscal year of $416.16 billion.\n\nAdditionally, as I pointed out in my previous column, “under (Apple CEO Tim) Cook, the results of substantially all the firm’s efforts at innovation, from its efforts to develop a car to Apple TV to AI, have been rather underwhelming.” The latter historical fact also makes me very doubtful about Apple’s ability to turn its AI offering into a huge needle mover of AAPL stock.\nAdditionally, I noted that \"Apple bulls, since at least August 2024, have predicted that the advent of AI would spark “a major upgrade cycle for the iPhone,” but this scenario has not yet materialized. Finally, analysts on average predict that the firm’s revenue will increase by 8.7% during its current fiscal year that ends in September, indicating that most do not expect such a cycle to materialize in 2026.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The business claimed the adjustments are designed to make its cars work better amid big problems, such blackouts that impair traffic lights and municipal infrastructure.The outage made the roads more dangerous, which tested how well self-driving cars can deal with abrupt system failures. Waymo stated in response that company is also changing its emergency response procedures to make sure that people work together better and make better decisions should similar things happen in the future.Waymo didn't say exactly when the upgrades would happen, but the firm did say that they will happen on all of its cars. The event shows how hard it is for self driving cars to get from controlled testing to driving in real cities.Waymo is still a long-term investment on self-driving cars for Alphabet. Investors will be keeping a careful eye on how the business improves the technology and deals with problems in the real world as robotaxi services grow.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump’s $100,000 H-1B Visa Application Fee Upheld by Judge\n\nMadlin Mekelburg\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:18 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTCS.BO\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge said the Trump administration can move ahead with a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, providing a setback for US technology companies that rely on hiring skilled foreign workers.\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell said in a ruling Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s effort to radically increase the cost of the popular visa is lawful. The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Will I get punished on taxes?\n\nSomewhere in Beijing, Chinese researchers are working on the same thing. They have a trillion yuan in backing and no shareholders asking about quarterly earnings.\nAnd somewhere, probably on your couch, you’re checking your index funds and wondering why this article is trying to scare you.\nHere’s why: The first nation to achieve quantum supremacy doesn’t just win a science prize. It wins the ability to break every encryption system protecting every bank, every military secret and every private message you’ve ever sent.\nThe experts have a name for that day. They call it Q-Day , which sounds like something from a movie you’d watch on an airplane, except this one is real and nobody knows exactly when it will arrive.\nThe tech nerds are high-fiving in Silicon Valley. The generals are briefing Congress. And most investors haven’t noticed.\n\nYou’re about to.\nAs Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parent Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, recently d, quantum today is where AI was five years ago: poised to make a small number of people obscenely wealthy.\nWhat qubits do that regular computers can’t Classical computers operate on binary bits. Ones and zeros. Yes or no. Like a very fast, very stupid employee who can only answer true-or-false questions.\nQuantum computers use qubits, which exploit something called “superposition” to exist in multiple states simultaneously. Problems that would take classical supercomputers longer than the age of the universe to solve suddenly become Tuesday afternoon’s work.\n\nThis includes drug discovery, materials science, logistics optimization and breaking every password ever created. That last application has attracted the keen interest of the Pentagon . When the U.S. Department of Defense compares quantum supremacy to aircraft carriers and sees it as a decisive factor in warfare, even the most committed pacifist should consider repositioning his portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nA trillion yuan buys a lot of physicists John Martinis, the winner of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics, recently that China is “nanoseconds” behind in the quantum race.\nLet me translate from physicist to English: We’re in a dead heat with a country that has declared its intention to become the global leader in quantum-information science, already dominates quantum communications, and just unveiled a one-trillion-yuan fund to boost “hard technologies.”\n\nThat’s $140 billion. It’s not a research grant, but a declaration of intent.\nThe first nation to develop a quantum computer capable of breaking classical cryptography will possess capabilities that make current cybersecurity look like a screen door on a submarine. Every encrypted communication, every financial transaction, every military secret becomes readable.\nThe U.S. government has noticed. DARPA’s just advanced 11 companies to Stage B evaluation, the broadest and most technologically diverse cohort they’ve ever assessed. The Pentagon has elevated quantum to the center of its future weapons strategy. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission is Congress to adopt a “Quantum First” national goal by 2030.\nWhen Congress agrees on anything, take note.\n\nWhy quantum is now an investment, not a theory Here’s the investment case in plain English: The science works. The question now is manufacturing.\nQuantum computing requires its own industrial revolution. It needs wafer-scale cryogenic integration, high-yield fabrication and architectures designed not for academic elegance but for factory floors.\nThis is good news for investors. Physics breakthroughs are unpredictable. Engineering problems can be solved with sufficient money and motivation. The U.S. has both.\n\nGoogle’s Willow chip matters not because of what it computes, but because of how it’s made — using industrial-grade fabrication that looks more like semiconductor manufacturing than a bespoke physics experiment. This is the template. This is how scientific curiosity becomes a transformational industry.\nMeanwhile, AI is accelerating quantum development while quantum accelerates AI. In February, released a model that sped up catalyst discovery for clean energy by 20,000x versus traditional methods. IONQ claims its quantum computers solve certain problems using less than 1% of the power consumption of classical supercomputers.\nThese are not incremental improvements. These are the numbers that launch industries.\nAn ETF and stocks to consider The honest investment columnist admits he doesn’t know which horse will win. He merely observes there’s a race, points out the horses that haven’t collapsed, and suggests betting on the field might be wiser than picking the champion.\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF QTUM provides broad exposure and trades at roughly 23 times cash flow. Not cheap, but not insane for a sector where winners might return 50 times. It’s up almost 40% so far this year, which either means you missed the easy money or the market has correctly identified something important.\n\nQuantinuum, majority-owned by Honeywell International HON, shows genuine technical promise. The company’s trapped-ion approach achieves a roughly 2:1 physical-to-logical qubit ratio. Most architectures need hundreds of physical qubits to create one error-corrected logical qubit. Quantinuum does it with two. This efficiency improvement turns “theoretically possible” into “commercially viable.”\nHoneywell shares are down this year, partly because it’s splitting into aerospace and automation divisions — and the market hates complexity. But Honeywell’s quantum exposure through Quantinuum may be undervalued precisely because nobody thinks of Honeywell as a quantum play. They think of thermostats.\nIonQ advanced to Stage B of DARPA’s initiative — meaning serious people with security clearances believe the company’s technology merits serious evaluation. Its trapped-ion architecture operates at room temperature, a meaningful advantage when competitors require cooling systems that make Antarctica look balmy. The stock is up this year but suffered a brutal correction from its October highs.\n\nHitachi JP:6501 is the quiet horse. While Americans argued about whether quantum was real, the Japanese were building it. Hitachi’s quantum initiatives span silicon-based hardware, optimization systems and quantum-safe encryption. The Tokyo-traded shares are up about 27% this year. That’s what happens when you do useful work while everyone else issues press releases.\nEverything that could go wrong (A partial list) Quantum stocks have been volatile enough to concern shareholders’ cardiologists. IonQ shares, for example, nearly tripled from January through mid-October — then lost a third of its value in two months. These are not investments for people who check portfolios daily.\nThe technology still faces challenges. Error correction at scale remains unsolved. Most quantum computers require temperatures colder than in outer space. The talent pool is approximately the size of a faculty meeting at MIT’s physics department.\n\nAnd the eventual winners here might not be publicly traded yet. Betting on quantum in 2025 resembles betting on automobiles in 1905. Henry Ford had yet to introduce the Model T. Most promising companies from that era no longer exist.\nBut someone was going to build cars. Someone is going to build quantum computers.\nMore: These Big Tech stocks are the smart way to invest in the quantum-computing boom\nWhat a prudent investor does now Quantum computing is transitioning from a science experiment to a strategic asset. The physics works. The engineering is progressing. Government and private money are flowing in quantities that would make a Gilded Age robber baron blush.\nThe prudent investor allocates a small portion of his portfolio to quantum exposure, accepts that volatility is the price of admission, and recognizes that long-term trajectory matters more than monthly price swings.\n\nThe imprudent investor ignores quantum entirely, on the theory that things he doesn’t understand can’t possibly matter. History has not been kind to that theory.\nHe has no position in any of the companies or investments mentioned in this article.\n\nMore from Charlie Garcia:\nChina is quietly destroying the dollar — and that’ll cost you.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI revenues surged 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. XPU adoption accelerated in the reported quarter as enterprises continue to use these to train their large language models and monetize their platforms through inference APIs and applications. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are major users of these XPUs.\n\nAVGO’s expanding clientele, which now includes Anthropic, is driving growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received a $10 billion order to sell Alphabet’s latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received an additional order worth $11 billion from the same customer. The company’s current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as AVGO’s latest 102-terabit per second Tomahawk 6 switch continues to gain traction. AVGO now expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 AI revenues to double year over year to $8.2 billion.\n\nAVGO’s networking portfolio is gaining from strong demand for Tomahawk 6 products, as well as the Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router. Broadcom also has a rich partner base that includes the likes of OpenAI, Walmart, NVIDIA, Canonical, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, among others. AVGO expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 Semiconductor revenues of $12.3 billion, suggesting 50% year-over-year growth. Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to grow 2% year over year to $6.8 billion.\n\nAVGO Faces Tough Competition in the Semiconductor Market Broadcom is a major player in the semiconductor market, but is facing stiff competition from NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for Gen AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues from Data Center (accounted for 89.8% of NVDA revenues) jumped 66% year over year and 25% sequentially to $51.22 billion.\n\nMarvell Technology is benefiting from the strong demand environment across the data center end market. MRVL’s data center end-market revenues jumped 39% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, propelled by strong growth across AI-driven demand for custom XPU silicon and electro-optics interconnect products. Marvell Technology’s AI-driven custom silicon business has secured more than 20 multi-generational XPU and XPU-attach socket wins. MRVL’s design pipeline has expanded to more than 50 opportunities worth $75 billion, underscoring hyperscalers’ growing reliance on Marvell’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nStory Continues\nAVGO’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Broadcom shares have appreciated 45.7% in a year, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nAVGO Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe AVGO stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/earnings of 33.89X compared with the broader sector’s 27.78X.

In the trailing nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Google Cloud revenues jumped 31.2% over the same year-ago time frame to $41.04 billion. The top line benefited from growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core products, AI Infrastructure and generative AI (Gen AI) Solutions. Cloud backlog jumped 46% sequentially to $155 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2025. The AI and security push is expected to boost Google Cloud’s prospects in the near term.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding AI infrastructure is helping Alphabet win enterprise clients. GCP’s prospects remain robust, driven by strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs (led by seventh-generation Ironwood) and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for the latest Gemini and other AI models, and other services, including cybersecurity and data analytics. Google Cloud is also benefiting from strong Gen AI adoption due to leading models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues from products developed on Google’s Gen AI models surged more than 200% year over year.\n\nSecurity push is expected to drive Google Cloud’s top-line growth further. The addition of Wiz (acquisition pending, expected to complete in 2026) to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT in the cloud computing space. The latest collaboration between Google Cloud and Palo Alto Networks combines Google Cloud’s AI and infrastructure capabilities with Prisma AIRS, the latter’s comprehensive AI security platform. Accelerating investments bodes well for GOOGL’s prospects. Alphabet expects capital expenditure between $91 billion and $93 billion for 2025, which is anticipated to increase further in 2026.\n\nGOOGL Faces Tough Competition in Cloud Domain Per Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 29% in the third quarter of 2025, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 20% and Google Cloud at 13%.\n\nAmazon is spending heavily on fortifying its Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure that supports AI workloads and expanded data center capacity. Amazon committed $125 billion in capital expenditure for 2025, with the vast majority directed toward AWS infrastructure.

We look forward to welcoming Sheldon and the Intersect team.”\nAlphabet states that this acquisition aligns with its strategy to collaborate with utilities and developers to ensure adequate energy supply for future data centre infrastructure growth without transferring costs to electricity grid customers.\n\nThe company is also pursuing a range of initiatives aimed at increasing energy capacity responsibly and speeding up the commercialisation of advanced energy technologies such as advanced geothermal systems, long-duration storage, and gas projects with carbon capture capabilities.\nAdditionally, Alphabet is employing artificial intelligence tools to assist with faster integration of new power plants into the grid and promote efficiency programmes within data centre communities.\n\nStory Continues\nIntersect founder and CEO Sheldon Kimber said: “Intersect has always been focused on bringing innovation to the industry and we look forward to accelerating at scale as part of Google.\n“Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI. We share Google’s conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.”\n\nThe deal remains subject to standard closing conditions and is expected to be finalised in the first half of 2026.\n\"Alphabet to acquire Intersect for $4.75bn in AI push\" was originally created and published by Verdict , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?",

The brand has received investment from global companies including Google and LVMH-affiliated investment firms and has been recognised internationally for its originality and competitiveness in design.\n\nIICOMBINED clarified that GENTLE MONSTER has no business or manufacturing relationship with any other eyewear company and emphasised that such claims are false and misleading. An internal investigation into design similarities revealed a high level of resemblance in at least 30 eyewear produ cts.\nIn response, IICOMBINED filed a design invalidation trial with the Korean Intellectual Property Trial and Appeal Board in March this year, and a decision is currently pending.\nTo protect brand integrity and prevent consumer confusion, IICOMBINED is pursuing both civil and criminal legal action. A criminal complaint was filed against Company B with investigative authorities in December last year. In March and June this year, provisional seizure applications were submitted to preserve damages. In October 2025, IICOMBINED further filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction and damages under the Unfair Competition Prevention Act.\n\nOver the years, the brand has grown into a global presence through the dedication and creativity of many contributors, as well as the continued trust and support of its customers. The company maintains a firm stance against any actions that imitate its brand identity or creative output, undermine brand value, or cause confusion among consumers.\nView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/gentle-monster-takes-legal-action-against-blatant-product-and-branding-imitation-302649231.html\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains\n\nDavid Beren\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:45 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThere is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The Shiller CAPE ratio sits above 35, a level seen only twice before: the Great Depression and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022. The Mag 7 tech stocks now represent 30% of total S&P 500 market value.\nAfter the 2000 peak at similar CAPE levels, the S&P 500 fell 49% over 2.5 years and took 7 years to recover.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMost importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged.\nThis indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn't flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market's overall value. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is.\n\nAI Mania Drives Stocks to Historic, Record Highs The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about.\n\nFor companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA's data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft's AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue.\n\nStory continues\nThis technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7's technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages.\n\nThe optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won't have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations.\nThis pattern of pricing in future success isn't new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it's how you're reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality.\n\nA Rare Signal Not Seen in Two Decades: What the Indicator Means The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\n\nThe last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover.\nThe CAPE ratio's predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment.\n\nWhat makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn't just existing in a silo. Instead, it's appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched.\nHistory's Verdict: A Reversal is Coming - How Smart Investors Respond History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we're going through now with AI.\n\nFor investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn't recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested.\nBuilding a cash reserve now so investors can \"buy the dip,\" as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven't experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size.\n\nThe key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn't the actual decline itself, it's the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it's going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade's best returns.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\n\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\n\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE\nBefore heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms -- Walden International and Walden Catalyst -- did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO\nBorn in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\n\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\n\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\n\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\n\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL\nSo far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\n\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Billionaires Buy 2 Trillion-Dollar AI Stocks Hand Over Fist Ahead of 2026\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points A few hedge fund managers with impressive track records bought shares of Alphabet and Meta Platforms in the third quarter.\nMeta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve engagement and ad conversion rates across its social media properties.\nAlphabet is monetizing artificial intelligence across its digital advertising and cloud computing businesses.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have advanced 13% year to date, bringing its market value to $1.6 trillion. Meanwhile, shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) have advanced 64%, bringing the company's market value to $3.7 trillion. Three top hedge fund managers bought both stocks in the third quarter.\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management added 793,500 shares of Meta Platforms and 2.2 million shares of Alphabet. Both stocks rank among his top 10 holdings.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors added 1.4 million shares of Meta Platforms and 2 million shares of Alphabet. Both stocks rank among his top 10 holdings.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management added 355,000 shares of Meta Platforms and 7.2 million shares of Alphabet. Both stocks rank among his top three holdings.\n\nImportantly, all three hedge fund managers handily outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the past three years, which makes them good sources of inspiration. But the trades mentioned took place in the third quarter, which ended several months ago. Here's a more current look at Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n1. Meta Platforms Meta has a strong presence in two industries: digital advertising and smart glasses. It owns three of the four most popular social media networks , which lets it collect user data and target media content. That advantage has made Meta the second-largest ad tech company in the world. But the company has also taken an early lead in the nascent smart glasses market.\n\nJPMorgan Chase analyst Dough Anmuth recently wrote, \"Meta is in rarified air across the combination of scale, growth, and profitability, as the company's massive reach and engagement continue to drive network effects, and its targeting abilities provide significant value to advertisers.\"\nMeta is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) -- from custom semiconductors to proprietary large language models -- to strengthen that network effect by boosting engagement and ad conversion rates across its social media properties. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts, \"Our AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant content,\" leading to more time spent on Instagram, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms is also developing a superintelligence system to integrate with its augmented reality smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says glasses will be our \"primary computing devices\" in the future. If he is correct, Meta -- which accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025 -- could become a consumer electronics giant in the 2030s.\n\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look quite reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842 per share. That implies 27% upside from its current share price of $661.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet is the largest ad tech company in the world because of its ability to engage consumers with Google Search and YouTube. The company is leaning on AI to better monetize those web properties. AI Overviews and AI Mode have increased query volume on Google Search, and generative AI tools are helping YouTube influencers create, edit, and optimize content.\n\nAlphabet has also developed an application called Gemini, a generative AI assistant built on a family of large language models of the same name. Gemini now has over 650 million monthly active users, and it ranks as the second most popular AI assistant behind ChatGPT. Alphabet does not sell ad inventory on the platform yet, but the company can certainly pull that lever in the future.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's Google Cloud is the third largest public cloud by infrastructure and platform services spending, and it gained 2 percentage points of market share in the last two years due. Consultancy Gartner recently ranked Google as the most capable cloud platform for AI application development, and Forrester Research ranked it as a leader in LLMs.\nThat praise suggests further market share gains are likely. Indeed, total cloud sales increased 34% in the third quarter, the second consecutive acceleration, driven by strong demand for Google's custom AI chips (called TPUs) and generative AI models. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate Google Cloud revenue growth will accelerate to 44% in 2026.\n\nWall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 15% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look tolerable. Among 75 analysts, Alphabet has a median target price of $330 per share. That implies 6% upside from its current share price of $310. Investors can buy a small position today if they feel so inclined, but I think Meta is the more attractive of the two stocks.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "Is It Too Late to Buy Alphabet Stock in 2026? The Answer May Surprise You.\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Alphabet stock is the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in 2025.\nThe company is gaining market share in artificial intelligence (AI) and has many other drivers of growth.\nMargin expansion and share buybacks will help earnings per share keep compounding.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nA surprise candidate has come from behind and turned into the top-performing \" Magnificent Seven\" stock of 2025. The company's name is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Owner of Google and various other technology platforms, Alphabet's stock was a laggard versus the likes of Microsoft earlier this year, but has come roaring back to produce a total return of 57% so far in 2025.\nThe stock once again has one of the largest market caps in the world, and now trades at a much higher price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). Does that mean it is too late to buy Alphabet stock for your portfolio? The answer may surprise you.\nSteady market share gains in AI usage First, we need to take a look at Alphabet's position within the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Current earnings for the business may be derived from Google Search, but future revenue will come from its Gemini AI model being deployed across its namesake app, Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud (among other Alphabet products).\nGemini began its growth much more slowly than the disruptive chatbots ChatGPT and Claude, both heavily funded AI start-ups. However, 2025 has been the year of market share gains for Gemini, which came from close to no usage to a 13% share of the AI market. It is still well behind ChatGPT, but growing quickly, and with a huge distribution advantage with the billions of users of Google products, it can be easily marketed.\n\nAlphabet also has a cost advantage due to using its own data center infrastructure and computer chips to run Gemini, making it more profitable than both OpenAI (owner of ChatGPT) and Anthropic (owner of Claude), which are burning a boatload of cash right now.\nEven though Alphabet is spending close to $25 billion a quarter on capital expenditures, it is still generating positive free cash flow and self-funding its AI expansion. No direct competitor can say the same.\nLong-term earnings power growth AI should be a steady growth driver for Alphabet, especially if Gemini can keep gaining market share.\nThat is not the entire Alphabet business. Well, a lot of the business is now utilizing Gemini's AI capabilities, but it is far from the only moneymaking product under its umbrella. For example, there is YouTube, with over $10 billion in quarterly advertising revenue. Or there's Google Cloud, which is growing 34% year over year at over $15 billion in quarterly revenue. Not to forget Google Search, the main profit driver (still) for Alphabet, with $50 billion in quarterly sales.\n\nStory Continues\nThe list could go on. We even have self-driving division Waymo that is scaling up rapidly in cities around the country.\nAlphabet's revenue is growing by 15% year over year right now, even at such an immense scale. With so many growth engines over the next five years, this megacap company should be able to keep compounding its revenue higher for a long while.\nIs Alphabet stock still a buy? Alphabet's earnings power certainly did not grow as fast as its stock price in 2025. The stock now has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 30 compared to close to 15 earlier this year. That puts high expectations on the business going forward.\nEven with this high P/E ratio, I still think Alphabet will do well for investors who buy today and hold for many years. As mentioned, sales are growing quickly, but earnings per share (EPS) are growing even faster with margin expansion and steady share repurchases. A fast-growing EPS will bring down Alphabet's P/E ratio quickly and deliver strong stock returns over the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $502,783 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,126,057 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 975 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

While the vehicles “successfully” handled 7,000 traffic signals that were knocked out by San Francisco’s power failure on Dec. 20, the outage “created a concentrated spike in these requests,” the company said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

When city officials urged motorists to stay off the streets, Waymo said it suspended service.\nThe power failures, touched off by a fire at a PG&E Corp. substation, rolled through San Francisco during the weekend, at one point affecting about 130,000 customers. Social media videos showed multiple Waymo vehicles stopped in the middle of streets with their hazard lights flashing, creating massive backups.\n\nThe company said it was taking steps to integrate more information in its software about the “context” of regional power outages, letting the vehicles “navigate these intersections more decisively.” Waymo also is working with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie on emergency response protocols and updating its first responder training.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nJohn Ballard, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 3:44 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Alphabet's Google continues to gain share in the cloud computing market.\nMicrosoft has over 900 million people using AI features in its products.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nInvestors looking for solid stocks to buy for the next five years shouldn't overthink it. Sticking with established tech giants is one of the best ways to ride the current trends in technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) .\nThese are some of the most profitable companies in the world, and they have the resources to invest in cutting-edge technologies, delivering returns for their investors. Here are two that would make solid buy-and-hold investments for the next five years.\n1. Alphabet (Google) Over the last five years, shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have more than tripled in value, and tailwinds are moving in its favor to drive more market-beating returns through the end of the decade. Google's recent financial results demonstrate that it is a significant force in AI.\n\nGoogle's services revenue, including Search, reached $87 billion in the third quarter, a 14% year-over-year increase. Search processes billions of daily queries. Google is seeing higher user engagement, driven by new AI features, including Overviews and AI Mode. AI Mode alone has reached 75 million daily active users, doubling the number of searches since the second quarter. The growth in Google's Search business demonstrates how it ultimately benefits from a massive data advantage, enabling it to train its Gemini AI model and deliver better services to users.\nGemini also powers enterprise tools across Google Cloud, which continues to gain share in the $390 billion cloud computing market, according to Synergy Research. Businesses are increasingly relying on cloud services for storage and software development, positioning Google for significant growth. The cloud segment posted a healthy 34% year-over-year revenue increase last quarter. The growth in the cloud is a prime example of Alphabet's competitive position in the AI market.\n\nDespite the stock's surge this year, it still trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 27 based on 2026 earnings estimates. This is attractive considering analysts expect earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 15% in the next several years. Assuming the stock maintains its current forward P/E in 2030, the share price could reach $600 based on these earnings growth estimates.\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a ubiquitous brand in computing, and that works to its advantage in the age of AI. Millions of people use Office and other Windows-based software products, providing a large installed base of users to monetize its AI investments. The stock has more than doubled since 2020, and the growing demand it is seeing in AI services could be enough to double the stock again.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's cloud infrastructure not only powers its enterprise cloud services but also its consumer-facing services. It has over 900 million monthly active users using AI features across its products. Microsoft 365, which includes Office, has over 400 million paid subscribers. New AI features drive healthy demand for these software products, with Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue up 26% year over year in the last quarter.\n\nAcross the business, Microsoft enjoys strong momentum. Its recent quarterly revenue of $77.7 billion increased by 18% year over year. The company's remaining performance obligations (representing long-term commitments from enterprises) reached $392 billion in the recent quarter. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of 51%.\nMicrosoft is playing a crucial role in one of the most significant transformations of the economy since the advent of the internet. The stock is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 30. This is reasonable for a leading cloud services provider experiencing robust revenue growth. Analysts currently project 13% annualized earnings growth over the next several years. This should fuel solid returns for Microsoft investors through at least 2030.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

(GOOG) closed the most recent trading day at $315.68, moving +1.4% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.46%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.57%.\nShares of the company witnessed a loss of 2.24% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 4.54%, and the S&P 500's gain of 4.22%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.59, indicating a 20.47% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $94.6 billion, up 15.91% from the year-ago period.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $10.58 per share and a revenue of $340.26 billion, signifying shifts of +31.59% and +15.3%, respectively, from the last year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.05% upward. At present, Alphabet Inc. boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Alphabet Inc. has a Forward P/E ratio of 29.42 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 20.08.\n\nWe can also see that GOOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.79. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Internet - Services industry stood at 1.79 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

On that day, Alphabet is projected to report earnings of $2.59 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 20.47%.

      "Content": "Apple spent 2025 setting itself up for the future — and its biggest moves weren't about AI\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nSSNLF\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Apple ( AAPL ). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Which Tech Titan Will Win the Quantum Race (and Net You 100% Returns)?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:43 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points You can pick small quantum computing stocks if you want high-risk, high-reward plays.\nBut tech giants are safer plays, and Nvidia's AI chips are pivotal for the quantum build-out.\nNvidia's NVentures is buying stakes in various quantum companies as part of its strategy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nBig tech's scramble to win the artificial intelligence (AI) race has taken some of the focus off quantum computing stocks and a potential upcoming boom. Last year, the Boston Consulting Group projected that quantum computing can create up to $850 billion of economic value by 2040. Tech giants have invested heavily in the space, with Google's Willow Chip being able to reduce errors exponentially.\nIt's unknown when quantum computing will have mainstream applications, but if this technology is perfected, it will be able to perform complex calculations and solve major problems that current computing can't. Quantum computing could result in major drug discoveries, encrypted codes getting solved, and business optimizations.\nQuantum computing means new chips and data centers. AI chips and data centers that handle AI workloads are not suitable for a quantum computing boom. That means many of the AI winners could also turn into quantum computing winners.\nSo, investing in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might be the best way to ride the quantum boom. Even with its current successes, Nvidia can still double from current levels if it gets quantum computing right. Let's see why.\nNvidia is already working on quantum Nvidia won't get caught behind other chipmakers in the upcoming quantum race. The company has established a reputation as the best AI chipmaker , and it's already set on becoming a leader in the quantum industry.\nNvidia recently announced NVQLink, which bridges the gap from AI chips to quantum computers. The company has already partnered with 17 quantum builders and nine scientific labs for this project. It's developing the software and digital infrastructure that will be necessary for a quantum boom.\n\nWhile Nvidia isn't developing a quantum chip right now, that may change as quantum computing gets closer to mainstream use. AI chips are already necessary for quantum infrastructure, but quantum chips are more advanced and are also needed. Quantum data centers will need both types of chips. Nvidia is already the clear winner on the AI side, and it has more money than its competitors to invest into research and development for quantum chips.\nNvidia is also investing in quantum computing companies Nvidia isn't just advancing its own quantum computing technology, but it is also buying stakes in quantum computing companies through NVentures. The company's venture capital arm invested in three quantum computing companies in the first half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nEven if Nvidia doesn't capitalize on quantum computing as much as expected, its investments can still pay off. Nvidia can also provide those companies with some of the resources they need to achieve higher returns.\nQuantum computing stocks like IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum show how much quantum computing investments can soar in a short time. All three of these growth stocks have rallied by more than 1,000% over the past three years. Those types of gains make it more plausible for Nvidia to double in value as quantum computing becomes a mainstream resource.\n\nNvidia wins regardless of which quantum computing companies win Nvidia isn't trying to create an innovative business that revolves around quantum computing. It's just selling picks and shovels in the middle of a gold rush. Nvidia produces the digital infrastructure and chips for companies that want to build out business models involving quantum computing.\n\nIf Nvidia wants to make quantum chips and additional tools for the industry, it can tap into a strong balance sheet and growing revenue. Nvidia generated $57 billion of revenue in its fiscal 2026's third quarter, up by 62% year over year. Net income came in at $31.8 billion, which represents a 59% increase. Nvidia makes more profits per quarter than the market caps of pure-play quantum computing stocks like IonQ.\nNvidia also closed out the quarter with $116.5 billion in total current assets. The AI chipmaker already has a lead in quantum since it has the best AI chips. However, it has plenty of capital ready to go if it wants to make a bigger push into quantum computing.\nSmaller quantum computing stocks may outperform Nvidia, but the latter already has a proven business model that brings in cold, hard cash.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $502,783 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,126,057 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 975 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Will Google Pass Nvidia in 2026 as the World’s Biggest Company?\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Google (GOOG) now leads AI software after overtaking Microsoft. Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Alphabet Agrees to Buy Intersect Power in $4.75 Billion Clean Energy Deal\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 9:07 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAlphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) has agreed to acquire clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash plus existing debt, a deal that could expand Google's access to electricity as it scales data centers tied to artificial intelligence. The acquisition, announced Monday, follows Google's minority investment in Intersect last year and comes as US power grids face rising strain from renewed demand growth. Alphabet said the transaction is intended to give Google greater flexibility to develop new power generation alongside expanding data center capacity, which has increasingly become a limiting factor for AI deployment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe deal arrives as the AI buildout drives consolidation across data centers and energy infrastructure. Google, along with Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft Corp. ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), has been managing the tension between rising electricity needs and long-term climate goals, after the company disclosed in 2024 that its carbon emissions increased 48% over the past five years due largely to data center operations. Intersect, backed by private equity firm TPG Inc., has focused on solar and battery storage projects designed to power large-scale data centers, particularly in Texas, a region its CEO Sheldon Kimber has described as attractive due to abundant wind and solar resources. The company has about 7.5 gigawatts of solar and storage in operation and another eight gigawatts in development, with much of that capacity tied to data-center-heavy markets.\n\nAs part of the transaction, Alphabet will acquire Intersect's power development platform, team, and in-development assets already contracted by Google, while Intersect will retain its brand and continue under Kimber's leadership. Grid assets contracted to other customers in Texas and California will remain outside the purchase, with TPG Rise Climate retaining a stake in those projects. Industry analysts have suggested the structure could reduce regulatory risk for Google, as owning power generation assets may provide more flexibility in how and where new data centers are built, rather than relying solely on third-party power arrangements as AI infrastructure continues to scale.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Palo Alto Networks Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold Following Its Major Multibillion-Dollar Google Deal?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:18 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: PANW\n\nGOOG\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) landed a multibillion-dollar deal last week that could reshape its competitive moat in the AI security market. The cybersecurity giant announced an expansion of its Google Cloud partnership that goes far beyond a typical vendor agreement. Palo Alto has committed to migrating key internal workloads to Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google infrastructure while embedding its Prisma AIRS security platform directly into Google's AI development tools and cloud services.\n\nThe deal addresses a critical market requirement revealed in Palo Alto's recent State of Cloud Report: enterprises are racing to deploy AI applications while nearly every organization experienced at least one attack on its AI infrastructure over the past year. This timing positions Palo Alto to capture an outsized share of the AI security spending wave as companies scramble to protect increasingly valuable and vulnerable AI workloads.\nMore News from Barchart Will Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO? And You Should Sell TSLA Here?\n‘Top Pick’ Amazon Had a Dismal Year: What’s AMZN Stock’s Forecast for 2026?\nThe Case for Nvidia Stock Hitting $275 in 2026\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThe partnership delivers immediate commercial traction by building on an already successful relationship that generated over $2 billion in Google Cloud Marketplace sales and established more than 75 joint integrations.\nNow Palo Alto gains native integration with Google's Vertex AI platform and Gemini language models, allowing it to embed security controls directly into where AI applications are being built rather than bolting on protection after deployment.\nThe multibillion-dollar commitment signals strategic conviction from both companies rather than a pilot program. This suggests the potential for material revenue contribution as enterprises standardize on combined Google-Palo Alto architectures for AI security.\nLet’s see whether PANW stock is a good buy given its widening AI moat.\nThe Bull Case for Investing in Palo Alto Networks Stock Palo Alto Networks ended fiscal Q1 with remaining performance obligations (RPO) of $15.5 billion, an increase of 24% year-over-year (YoY). Its next-generation security annual recurring revenue rose 29% to $5.85 billion.\nThe company's platformization strategy continues to gain traction as customers consolidate fragmented security architectures. Management highlighted a $100 million deal with a major telecom provider that included an $85 million XSIAM commitment. It was the largest security operations platform deal in the company's history. Another notable win was a $33 million SASE contract with a federal cabinet agency, in which PANW secured 60,000 seats by displacing an entrenched incumbent.\n\nStory Continues\nIn fiscal Q1, Palo Alto Networks reported revenue of $2.47 billion, an increase of 16% YoY. Its product sales grew by 23% as software form factors now account for 44% of trailing 12-month product sales.\nThe shift toward software firewalls has accelerated due to the proliferation of cloud workloads and the demand for protected multi-cloud environments. Palo Alto holds roughly 50% market share in third-party cloud firewalls with no significant competition outside individual cloud service providers.\n\nOperating margins expanded 140 basis points to 30.2%, marking the second consecutive quarter above 30% and demonstrating improving operational leverage. Management expects to maintain at least 37% adjusted free cash flow margins in fiscal 2026, even after integrating pending acquisitions, with a path to 40% plus margins by fiscal 2028.\nThe company announced a $3.35 billion acquisition of Chronosphere, an observability platform that management believes addresses a gap in the AI infrastructure stack. Chronosphere has reached over $160 million in annual recurring revenue with triple-digit growth by solving observability challenges at a fraction of typical vendor costs. The platform already serves two of the top five frontier AI model providers, which indicates technical credibility at extreme scale.\n\nManagement raised its fiscal 2030 ARR target for next-generation security from $15 billion to $20 billion. The increase reflects confidence in core business momentum across SASE, which surpassed $1.3 billion in ARR and grew 34%, and XSIAM, which now serves approximately 470 customers with an average ARR exceeding $1 million per customer.\nPalo Alto Networks introduced several new products, including AgentiX, which brings autonomous AI agents to security operations, and expanded its quantum-safe security offerings through a partnership with IBM (IBM).\nManagement expects quantum computing to drive a multi-year enterprise infrastructure upgrade cycle as organizations prepare for post-quantum cryptography requirements by 2029.\nIs PANW Stock Undervalued? PANW stock has returned over 540% to shareholders over the past decade. According to consensus estimates, the cybersecurity giant is forecast to increase revenue from $9.22 billion in fiscal 2025 (ended in July) to $16.98 billion in fiscal 2030. In this period, free cash flow is forecast to grow from $3.7 billion to $8.45 billion.\n\nCurrently, PANW trades at a forward FCF multiple of 31x, which is above its 10-year average of 23.5x. If the tech stock is priced at 25x forward FCF, it could gain 62% within the next three years.\nOut of the 49 analysts covering PANW stock, 34 recommend “Strong Buy,” three recommend “Moderate Buy,” 11 recommend “Hold,” and one recommends “Strong Sell.” The average PANW stock price target is $225.38, above the current price of $188.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It has over $100 billion in assets, and the fund has made solid moves despite market uncertainties. Following the steps of billionaires can help you build a portfolio that stands the test of time. However, due diligence is very important.\n\nBridgewater Associates has made several transactions in the third quarter, and it is reflected in the 13F reports. However, the billionaire has played safe with his investments. His top holdings include two tech titans and two ETFs. Here’s why I’d recommend them too.\nQuick Read Bridgewater increased its iShares Core S&P 500 ETF position by 4.83% in Q3. The fund now represents 10.62% of the portfolio.\nAlphabet reported revenue of $102.3B (up 16% year over year) and cloud revenue of $15.2B (up 34%).\nMicrosoft’s cloud segment grew 28% to $30.9B in revenue. Azure demand has outpaced supply.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF Bridgewater Associates has the highest allocation in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF ( NYSEARCA:IVV ), comprising 10.62% of the portfolio. The hedge fund increased its position by 4.83% in the third quarter. Bridgewater owns more than 1 million shares of the ETF and started investing in IVV in 2010. IVV has $733 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe ETF provides exposure to large-cap companies in the U.S. and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index. IVV invests in the 500 top U.S. companies based on their market capitalization. This means its top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon.\nThe fund has a yield of 1.04% and pays quarterly dividends. Its highest allocation lies in the technology sector at 34.36%, followed by financials (13.38%) and consumer discretionary (10.56%). IVV has a low expense ratio of 0.03% and has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 94.83% and a 5-year return of 114.12%.\nIVV has gained 17.09% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $687.83. The fund has the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming years. With more than two decades of history, the fund has established itself as a strong player offering broad U.S. equity exposure.\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust Bridgewater has the second-highest position in State Street’s S&P 500 ETF ( NYSE: SPY ), which makes up 6.69% of the total portfolio. The fund also tracks the performance of the S&P 500 and is the first exchange-traded fund listed in the United States.\n\nStory Continues\nSPY is a low-risk investment that ensures steady capital appreciation. It has gained 17.41% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $684.83. The fund holds 503 stocks and has an expense ratio of 0.09%. It has a yield of 1.04% and has the highest allocation in the information technology sector (34.08%), followed by financials (13.55%) and consumer discretionary (10.62%).\n\nSimilar to IVV, its top 10 holdings include industry stalwarts such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Despite making several buy and sell transactions, Dalio prefers to stick to some ETFs, and SPY is one of them. It can help build a strong foundation for your portfolio. The fund has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 20.43% and a 5-year return of 15.12%.\nWith SPY, you get to own the biggest companies across industries. IVV and SPY are virtually identical in many ways. Both track the S&P 500 index and have generated similar returns over time.\nAlphabet Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) forms 2.53% of Bridgewater’s portfolio and holds more than 3 million shares. While the hedge fund has trimmed its position over time, it still remains one of the top holdings. Looking at Dalio’s holdings, it shows that he’s bullish on the tech sector.\nAlphabet has gained 61.89% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $308.61. It has a comprehensive AI ecosystem that ensures steady revenue growth. While the company is known for the dominating Google search engine, it has a massive empire that continues to grow. Its search engine continues to lead the industry, while YouTube has become the largest streaming platform today.\n\nIts numbers are impressive. It reported a revenue of $102.3 billion, up 16% year over year, while the net income jumped 33%. Its cloud revenue soared 34% to $15.2 billion, and Google Services revenue jumped 14% to $87.1 billion. Its cloud division has gained a multi-year deal worth $10 billion with Palo Alto Networks, aimed at expanding the AI-driven security infrastructure.\nThere’s plenty of growth still to come. Wall Street remains bullish on the stock as its core business continues to thrive. A Wedbush analyst has an Outperform rating for the stock with a price target of $350.\nMicrosoft Corporation Tech dinosaur Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) forms 2.23% of Dalio’s portfolio. While he has trimmed his stake in the company during the third quarter, Microsoft continues to remain one of the top five holdings. The tech giant has seen a steady climb and continued optimism by Wall Street experts. AI will accelerate Microsoft’s growth, and the demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure has outpaced supply.\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about Microsoft’s AI rollout across its entire product stack and the expansion of CoPilot in Windows. In the recently announced results, the company beat earnings and revenue expectations. It reported a revenue of $77.67 billion, up 18% year over year, and an EPS of $4.13. Its cloud segment recorded a growth of 28% with a revenue of $30.9 billion, being one of the biggest growth drivers for the business.\nMSFT stock has gained 15.80% year to date and is exchanging hands for $484.72. It has a dividend yield of 0.75% and has raised dividends every year since 2010. Despite the low yield, it is an excellent dividend stock to own. The company has increased its dividend by 250% in the past decade. However, the stock price has gone up; hence, the yield has dropped.\n\nDespite trimming his stake, Dalio believes in the future of Microsoft and has held the stock since 2005.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "3 Self-Driving Tech Stocks to Ride into 2026 as AV Race Heats Up\n\nMaharathi Basu\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:41 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BIDU\n\nUBER\n\nGOOG\n\nThe push to create autonomous vehicles (AVs) is reaching a pivotal stage, with multiple companies investing billions of dollars in self-driving innovations and vying for dominance. Whether through partnerships or in-house development, the race to deploy robotaxis at scale is set to reshape transportation.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, AV-focused companies are likely to offer compelling opportunities. The likes of Baidu BIDU, Alphabet GOOGL and Uber Technologies UBER stand out as attractive names to watch.\nFactors Favoring the Emergence of AV Autonomous or self-driving cars offer a wide range of advantages that position them to reshape the future of transportation fundamentally. One of the most significant benefits is improved road safety. Human error accounts for the majority of traffic accidents, and self-driving systems —powered by sensors, cameras and artificial intelligence — can reduce collisions by reacting faster, maintaining constant attention and following traffic rules consistently.\n\nAutonomous vehicles also promise greater efficiency and convenience. They can optimize routes, reduce traffic congestion through coordinated movement, and enable smoother traffic flow. For passengers, self-driving cars free up travel time, allowing people to work, relax, or engage in other activities instead of focusing on driving.\nAnother major advantage is increased mobility and accessibility. Autonomous cars can provide reliable transportation for individuals who are unable to drive, such as the elderly, people with disabilities, or those without access to traditional vehicles. This could significantly enhance independence and quality of life for many users. From an economic and environmental perspective, autonomous vehicles can lower transportation costs by reducing fuel consumption, minimizing accidents, and enabling shared mobility services.\n\nDriverless supply can reduce long-term trip costs, improve reliability during peak demand and offer a repeatable model for integrating more AV partners in new cities. Together, these benefits make autonomous vehicles a transformative force, with the potential to create safer roads, more efficient cities, and a more inclusive and sustainable transportation system.\nAV tech is maturing fast, and the companies leading the charge in software, chips and robotics are worth watching. Whether you’re excited about the rise of cleaner, greener cars—or the possibility of never having to drive one again—this space is full of innovation. The heating up of the global AV race is an indication of turning robotaxis from a futuristic concept into a global transportation reality.\n\nStory Continues\nWith technology improving rapidly, autonomous driving has emerged as a major trend. Better sensors, smarter software, and advances in artificial intelligence are making AVs safer and more reliable. According to Statista, the global AV market could rise from about $106 billion in 2021 to more than $2.3 trillion by 2030.\n\nGiven this rosy background, we highlight three stocks with a focus on shaping the future of autonomous mobility from the Zacks Computer and Technology sector that investors should monitor.\nAll three stocks have outperformed the sector over the past year.\n1-Year Price Comparison Image Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOur Choices Baidu is a key player in the robotaxi space, though its progress is concentrated in China. The country is establishing itself as a global powerhouse in autonomous driving. Its companies have tested self-driving cars in all kinds of conditions—from the busy streets of Beijing to quieter suburban roads.\n\nBaidu’s Apollo Go service already offers fully driverless robotaxi operations in cities like Beijing, Wuhan and Shenzhen, and is spreading internationally in markets like Dubai and Switzerland. With operations in more than 20 cities and fully driverless coverage across key mainland regions, Baidu is building a scale and density that only a few competitors can match. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Baidu’s 2026 earnings per share suggests a year-over-year improvement of 16.8%. BIDU stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nAlphabet ’s Waymo is another major player and a force to reckon with in the evolving and lucrative space. Alphabet, through its Waymo arm, already has commercial operations in several cities across the United States.\nWaymo has been operating truly driverless vehicles for years and recently crossed 450,000 weekly paid rides, almost double the 250,000 it reported in April. It continues to widen its lead with new expansions, including freeway operations in three cities and autonomous service in markets like Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando. Its entire fleet runs without safety drivers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alphabet’s 2026 earnings per share suggests a year-over-year improvement of 4.1%. GOOGL stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nUber has adopted an asset-light approach through strategic partnerships to gain a stronghold in the robotaxi market. Multiple agreements in this area underscore Uber’s commitment to integrating cutting-edge AV technologies into its platform. With this partnership-driven approach, Uber has avoided the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently.\nUber’s dominant market share in the ride-hailing industry also gives it a unique advantage. With its vast network of drivers and customers, Uber can quickly scale autonomous services once the technology matures. Its app is designed to integrate AVs from multiple partners, giving users a variety of options.\nUber’s AV ambitions are gaining real-world traction through scalable, cross-market deployments. While macro risks and regulatory scrutiny remain, Uber’s ability to scale both core businesses (mobility and delivery) and emerging automation initiatives positions it well for long-term growth. Uber is focused on unlocking growth in suburban and low-density markets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Uber’s 2026 earnings per share has been revised 2.6% upward over the past 60 days.

      "Content": "An X-Ray View of the Magnificent Seven\n\nJohn Dorfman\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:38 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBy John Dorfman December 22, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate)\nFor the past three years, a huge share of the stock market's action has been in the Magnificent Seven , a small group of super-successful, super-popular stocks.\nThere are signs of fatigue in this leadership group. But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

The recent guidance reaffirmation around at least 8% adjusted EPS growth through 2035 and dividend increases through 2028 supports that thesis. The biggest near-term catalyst remains execution on AI-linked power deals, while elevated interest rates and financing costs still look like the most immediate risk, and the latest news does not materially change that.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement is NextEra’s plan to build 15 GW of new power generation for data center hubs by 2035. This directly connects to its long-term AI power agreements with Google and Meta, reinforcing the growth side of the story that underpins management’s 8% EPS target. How efficiently NextEra funds and delivers this build-out, given its capital intensity and rate sensitivity, will likely influence whether those catalysts outweigh today’s financing and regulatory risks.\nYet even with these ambitious AI projects, investors should be aware that higher-for-longer interest costs and weaker free cash flow coverage of the dividend could...\nRead the full narrative on NextEra Energy (it's free!)\nNextEra Energy's narrative projects $35.9 billion revenue and $9.4 billion earnings by 2028.\n\nUncover how NextEra Energy's forecasts yield a $91.14 fair value , a 14% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Some of the most optimistic analysts were already penciling in about US$40.1 billion of revenue and US$10.7 billion of earnings by 2028, so if you buy into that view you are effectively betting that catalysts like AI data center demand and nuclear restarts will outweigh concerns such as Florida climate exposure and regulatory shifts, while recognizing that this new AI-focused news could either reinforce or challenge those earlier assumptions.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 11 other fair value estimates on NextEra Energy - why the stock might be worth as much as 29% more than the current price!\nBuild Your Own NextEra Energy Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "Google started the year behind in the AI race. It ended 2025 on top.\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:03 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nCRM\n\nGoogle ( GOOG , GOOGL ) entered 2025 in a difficult position. While its stock price rose 36% in 2024, the company was still largely perceived by Wall Street as playing second (or third) fiddle to OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) in the AI race.\nFast-forward to today, and Google is stealing the show, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a \"code red\" emergency as the company works to match Google's latest Gemini 3 AI models. It's an interesting twist, given that Google declared its own code red after ChatGPT hit the market in 2022.\n\nGoogle is also catching up to OpenAI in the key monthly active user (MAU) metric.\nThen there are Google chip wins. In October, Claude developer Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) announced it was expanding its plan to use Google's AI chips, including using up to 1 million processors , to power its AI software.\nGoogle is also in talks to provide its chips to Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta ( META ) to run its AI products, according to The Information .\nIt all added up to a strong 2025 for the search giant, setting it up for continued success in the year ahead.\n\"Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in CY26,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a Dec. 11 investor note.\n\"Google is in the strongest position when it comes to a fully integrated AI stack,\" he wrote. \"Gemini is a leading model, its user base is expanding faster than OpenAI's, Search is integrating AI effectively with ads reportedly on the way, and [Google Cloud Platform] continues to hold its ground in the infrastructure buildout cycle.\"\n\nGoogle's AI wins pile up Google counts its AI revenue as part of its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) business. According to the company, that has given GCP a significant boost. In Q3, Google said its GCP revenue grew 34% year over year to $15.1 billion . It rose 32% in the prior quarter.\nThe number of new customers to the GCP jumped 34%.\n\n\"Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.\nAccording to Pichai, Google signed more deals worth more than $1 billion in its third quarter than it did in the previous two years combined. More than 70% of the company's existing cloud customers are using its AI services, he added.\nThe company has also more deeply intertwined its AI capabilities with Google Search, launching its ChatGPT-like AI Mode for all US users in May at the Google I/O conference and dropping ads into AI Overviews in search.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle has also managed to win over social media users with its Nano Banana AI image app, which went viral in August. Then came the biggest bomb: Gemini 3.\nAnnounced in November , Gemini 3 immediately won praise from users, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who said he was ditching ChatGPT after using the app for Gemini 3.\n\nGemini 3 sent shockwaves through the AI industry, unseating GPT-5.1 as the leading AI model across several categories.\nGoogle's user base is also growing. According to TD Cowen's John Blackledge, a survey of roughly 2,500 US consumers found that Gemini's MAU penetration ramped faster than ChatGPT's from July to October.\nGemini MAU penetration was 24% in July and climbed to 26% in October. Google's AI Mode also improved from 18% to 19%. ChatGPT, however, saw its MAU penetration decline from 36% to 35% in the same time period.\n\nMarket intelligence firm Sensor Tower says that both apps continue to see significant growth, with global MAU up 180% and 125% for ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively. But like TD Cowen, Sensor Tower found that ChatGPT's MAU grew roughly 15% between August and December. Gemini was up 30%, thanks in part to its Nano Banana image editing app.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that Gemini is also available on all newer Android devices, making it far easier to access than ChatGPT, which requires users to navigate to a website or download the ChatGPT app.\nGoogle's other beats AI wasn't the only bright spot for Google in 2025. While the company lost its second antitrust case in April, with a judge finding it holds an illegal monopoly through its online advertising business, its legal issues weren't all bad.\nIn September, a judge declined to force Google to give up its Chrome browser after he found the company holds an illegal monopoly over the search market.\nThe judge also allowed Google to continue to make payments to \"distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or GenAI products.\"\nThat means the company can continue to pay Apple upwards of $20 billion a year to make Google Search the default search option on its iPhone and other devices.\n\nOutside of its legal dramas, Google has also made major strides with self-driving car company Waymo. The firm expanded its availability to other cities — including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando — and began offering freeway driving around San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\nGoogle also showed off its prototype smart glasses and a new Samsung VR headset, both of which use software based on a version of Android called Android XR, which was developed by Google and Samsung.\nLook for that and more in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Existing investor CapitalG, ​Alphabet's VC arm, also participated in the ​round.\nArmis, founded in 2015, unveiled a three-year plan last month to reach $1 billion in annual recurring revenue after crossing ‍the $300 million milestone ⁠in August.\nServiceNow closed its $2.85 billion acquisition of Moveworks this month. It spent $506 million on Logik.ai, while financial details for Veza buyout were ⁠undisclosed.\nIts deal with Armis is expected to close in the second half of ‌2026.\n(Reporting by Kritika Lamba and Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing ‌by Sriraj Kalluvila and Shilpi Majumdar)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia vs Alphabet: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Nvidia and Alphabet are set to be the top-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in 2025.\nNvidia is expected to continue seeing strong growth in 2026 as AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up.\nThe network effect of Apple's vertical AI model should really start to shine through next year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe two top-performing \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks in 2025 were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . As of this writing, Nvidia's stock is up around 30%, while Alphabet has turned in a 60% gain.\nLet's see which stock is poised to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Nvidia Where artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending heads, Nvidia's stock is likely to follow. The company is the dominant player in the space with its graphics processing units (GPUs), and while competition has increased, no one is close to unseating the king. It still has a wide moat with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code has been written, while its recent acquisition of SchedMD will only help widen its software moat.\nMeanwhile, its NVLink interconnect system helps prevent vendor mixing and matching because it's a proprietary system that lets its GPUs quickly pass along data and pool memory, allowing an AI cluster to act as a single powerful unit.\nMeanwhile, the setup for the company looks attractive heading into 2026. All the major cloud computing companies have discussed ramping up data center capex spending next year, which bodes well for it. At the same time, the U.S. just gave it the green light to start selling its H200 chip to commercial Chinese customers, reopening a big market for it. In addition, large customer OpenAI is close to closing $100 billion in new funding, which should help it with its aggressive AI data center buildout.\n\nOn top of that, Nvidia's stock is attractively valued, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 23 times 2026 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.7 times. Positive PEGs below 1 are generally viewed as undervalued.\nThe case for Alphabet Alphabet's biggest advantage is that it is the one major hyperscaler (owner of large data centers) that isn't largely reliant on Nvidia. The company developed its own custom AI chips over a decade ago, and today most of its internal workloads are run on its tensor processing units (TPUs). That has given the company both a cost advantage with its cloud computing business, as well as with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Cloud has been a huge growth driver for Alphabet, and that should only continue in 2026 as the unit has been capacity-constrained. Alphabet has been spending aggressively, which should result in Google Cloud's growth accelerating. Alphabet also made an under-the-radar move the past couple of years with its chips that could lead to big growth.\n\nTPUs were originally designed for Google Cloud's TensorFlow framework, but Alphabet shifted its chips to be more framework agnostic, including supporting the popular PyTorch framework. This move allows it to rent out its TPUs to other companies. Anthropic is one of the first companies to jump on this opportunity, agreeing to deploy $21 billion in TPUs. Morgan Stanley has estimated that for every 500,000 TPUs deployed, Alphabet will generate around $13 billion in annual revenue. It's currently projecting the company will rent out 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has trained its top-tier Gemini model on its TPUs, while it also runs inference with them. This gives it a significant cost advantage over competitors like OpenAI, allowing it to continue investing more money in its model and further improve it.\n\nIt also has the advantage of being able to integrate Gemini throughout its products, making them better. It essentially has what can be referred to as a \"surface advantage,\" bringing AI to the places where people already are, rather than relying on stand-alone apps and third-party integrations. These advantages should just continue to grow and drive revenue in 2026 and beyond.\nThe verdict I think Nvidia and Alphabet should both have strong years in 2026. Both stocks are attractively valued with forward P/Es of 23 times and 27 times, respectively, and both should produce strong revenue growth.\nHowever, of the two, I think Alphabet's stock will once again outperform in 2026. It has a more durable business (it's less cyclical and doesn't rely on heavy customer capex spending), and I think the network effects of its model will really start to shine through next year, powering the stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Wall Street generally remains positive in the last two truncated trading weeks of any year with muted volumes. This year, market participants&rsquo; confidence has received a boost from renewed momentum in the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. All three major stock indexes ended in positive territory.\n\nHow Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) advanced 0.5% or 227.79 points to close at 48,362.68 Notably, 20 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 10 finished in negative territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 23,428.83, rising 0.5% or 121.21 points on the strong performance of AI bigwigs.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained 0.6% points to finish at 6,878.49. Six out of 11 broad-sectors of the broad-market index ended in positive territory while four ended in negative territory and one remained unchanged. The technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) rose 2.2%. On the other hand, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) fell 1.3%.\n\nThe fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 5.6% to 14.08, marking its lowest closing since Dec. 13, 2024. A total of 14.57 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 16.9 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.15-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.\n\nAI Trade Continues to Thrive The AI saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nGoldman Sachs and Bank of America projected that AI infrastructure capex spending will cross $1 trillion in 2028. JP Moran and Citigroup forecast this figure to total $5 trillion cumulative in 2030. Research firm McKinsey & Co. estimated that global AI-powered data center infrastructure capex will reach around $7 trillion by 2030.\n\nFour of the &ldquo;magnificent 7&rdquo; stocks have decided to invest a massive $380 billion in 2025 as capital expenditure for AI-infrastructure development. This marks a significant 54% year-over-year increase in capital spending on the AI ecosystem. Moreover, these companies have also said that AI capex is likely to increase handsomely in 2026.\n\nLatest Developments on AI Space The Trump administration has decided to allow the generative AI chipset behemoth NVIDIA Corp. NVDA to sell its high-end H200 AI chips to some &ldquo;approved customers&rdquo; in China. Reuters reported that NVIDIA is considering shipment of H200 chips to China from mid-February 2026. The H200 chip is two generations behind NVDA&rsquo;s current Blackwell Ultra processors.\n\nReuters reported that the initial shipment will consist of around 40,000 to 80,000 H200 chips. Several investment banks have estimated that the resumption of sales in China could bring back around $10 to $20 billion in revenues per calendar year for the company.\n\nAlphabet Inc. GOOGL has decided to acquire data center and energy infrastructure company, Intersect, for a consideration of $4.75 billion in cash. In addition, Alphabet will assume the debts of Intersect. Alphabet expects the deal to bring more data center and generation capacity online faster.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said, &ldquo;Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive U.S. innovation and leadership.&rdquo;\n\nThe stock prices of NVIDIA and Alphabet rose 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively.

United States Steel became the first $1 billion enterprise on the planet in 1901, and 117 years later, in 2018, iPhone maker Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone.\nEight other U.S. companies have since joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club, including Nvidia , Alphabet , Amazon , and Tesla . It looked as though Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was set to join them back in September as its market capitalization peaked at $940 billion, but following a 41% decline in its stock price since then, the company is now valued at just $550 billion.\nRecent stock price performance aside, artificial intelligence (AI) developers are lining up to rent access to Oracle's data center infrastructure, which is fueling a surge in the company's revenues. Could it be only a matter of time before this tech titan charts a path back toward $1 trillion?\nA leader in AI infrastructure Most AI development happens inside large, centralized data centers fitted with tens of thousands of advanced parallel processors -- many of them graphics processing units ( GPUs ) supplied by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It can cost billions of dollars to build a single data center, and since most businesses don't have that kind of money to dedicate to such endeavors, they rent computing capacity from specialized operators like Oracle instead.\n\nOracle's data center infrastructure is among the best in the industry. It uses proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology that moves data between chips and devices more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, even minor increases in processing speed can result in major cost savings over time.\nOracle's data centers also offer significant scale, enabling developers to tap into clusters of over 131,000 GPUs, which is enough to handle even the most advanced AI workloads.\nMoreover, it's bringing capacity online at a rapid pace. As of the conclusion of its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended Nov. 30), Oracle had 147 data center regions up and running with 64 more in the pipeline. OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech juggernauts using Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue is soaring Oracle generated $16.1 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2026 second quarter, which was a modest 14% increase from the prior-year period. But revenue from its cloud infrastructure segment, specifically, soared by 66% to a record $4.1 billion.\nThe cloud infrastructure unit could be growing its sales even faster, but Oracle simply can't build data centers fast enough to meet demand. That's why the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) rocketed by a whopping 438% year over year to $523 billion during the quarter. RPO is like an order backlog, because it reflects the value of signed contracts with customers for services that haven't been delivered yet.\n\nAround $300 billion of Oracle's RPO is reportedly from one customer, OpenAI, which creates concentration risk. OpenAI is still a fairly young company, and it doesn't have anywhere close to $300 billion in cash on hand. Unless it becomes a raging financial success, this enormous commitment might never convert into revenue for Oracle.\nSkepticism about this deal is part of the reason Oracle stock has plummeted in the past few months. The company has around $108 billion in debt, and it's taking on even more to fund the construction of more data centers. The possibility that one of its top customers might never have the money to rent all of the capacity it has requested is spooking investors.\nWill Oracle join the $1 trillion club? Oracle generated earnings of $5.32 per share over the last four quarters on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, which gives its stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.1. That is a premium to the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so even though Oracle stock has tumbled, it still isn't cheap.\nFrom its market cap of about $550 billion today, Oracle's stock would have to soar by 82% for the company to join the $1 trillion club. If we assume Oracle's P/E ratio remains exactly where it is right now, the company would have to nearly double its earnings per share to justify that type of share price gain. If its P/E ratio declines further, it will have an even steeper mountain to climb.\n\nOracle's AI business is growing at a lightning-fast pace right now, so there's a good chance the company will join the $1 trillion club at some point, but it probably won't be the next member inducted. Several other U.S. companies are much closer to the mark: Walmart has a market cap of $911 billion, and JPMorgan Chase is also in range at $872 billion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?

      "Content": "My Top 3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in December\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Alphabet's Google Quantum AI is addressing nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing.\nAmazon's Ocelet chip holds the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of quantum error correction.\nMicrosoft's topoconductors could represent a giant leap forward in building large-scale quantum computers.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\n\"Plastics.\"\nThat's the one-word advice that Mr. McGuire (played by Walter Brooke) gave to Dustin Hoffman's character, Benjamin Braddock, in the classic 1967 movie The Graduate . If the movie were remade today, though, McGuire might have to use two words in his investing recommendation to young Braddock – quantum computing .\nQuantum computing is poised to profoundly reshape the technological landscape over the next few years. Importantly, it presents tremendous opportunities for investors today. I think that some opportunities stand out above others, though. Here are my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is best known as the parent company of Google. And Google, of course, is best known for its ubiquitous search engine. However, Google is also working to advance quantum computing.\nGoogle Quantum AI officially began operating in 2012. Its mission, then and now, is to 'build quantum computing for otherwise unsolvable problems.\"\n\nTo achieve this lofty goal, Google Quantum AI covers nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing . Its staff work on both hardware (including quantum processors and cooling systems called cryostats) and software (including operating systems and user applications).\nThus far, Google Quantum AI has completed two of the six milestones on its roadmap to build a practical, large-scale quantum computer. In 2019, Google Quantum AI announced that its technology achieved quantum supremacy (a term used to describe where a quantum computer solves a problem that would take classical supercomputers a significantly long time to handle). In 2023, its team unveiled the first logical qubit prototype that demonstrated quantum error correction.\n2. Amazon You may have also heard about my second quantum computing stock. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reigns as the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce and cloud services. The company is also an important player in quantum computing.\nIn one sense, Amazon is a \"picks-and-shovels\" play in quantum computing. Amazon Braket is a quantum cloud computing service that's available on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It supports researchers in developing quantum computing algorithms, testing quantum hardware, and creating quantum software.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Amazon isn't just operating on the sidelines in the quantum computing arena. The company is also busy developing its own quantum technology. In February 2025, Amazon announced a new quantum computing chip called Ocelet.\nOcelet could be a key breakthrough in the goal to build large-scale quantum computers. The chip can reduce the costs of quantum error correction by up to 90% versus current approaches. It uses \"cat-qubits\" (named after physicist Erwin Schrödinger's famous quantum thought experiment, which featured a cat) that can suppress some types of quantum computing errors.\n\n3. Microsoft My third pick is also a household name. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a technology giant with products including the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office 365 productivity software, and Xbox gaming systems. Like Alphabet and Amazon, Microsoft is also investing heavily in quantum computing.\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform offers a \"Quantum Ready\" program. This program helps leaders develop strategies to mitigate the potential negative impact of quantum computing on their organizations while leveraging the opportunities that quantum computing presents.\n\nArguably, the most crucial quantum computing initiative for Microsoft is its topological core architecture. This architecture utilizes topological superconductors, also known as topoconductors, which are a special type of matter that falls neither into the solid, liquid, nor gas states.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced the first quantum computing chip that uses topoconductors – Majorana 1. Microsoft believes the technology used in Majorana 1 presents a key step toward fitting 1 million or more qubits on a single chip.\nCommon denominators You may have noticed several commonalities among my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December. They're all so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. They all operate widely used cloud platforms. All three companies are leaders in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlso, none of them are pure-play quantum computing companies. I think that's critical. No one knows for sure which quantum technologies will emerge as the biggest winners. Investing in a single pure-play quantum computing stock could be a highly risky proposition.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have ample financial flexibility to acquire smaller rivals that show exceptional promise. If you want to profit from quantum computing but not take on a significant amount of risk, these megacap stocks are the way to go, in my opinion.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor , and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\nSee the 10 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 22, 2025\nKeith Speights has positions in Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.

      "Content": "BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\n\nAmin Ayan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIBIT\n\nBLK\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nBlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025, ranking the product alongside Treasury bills and US mega-cap technology stocks.\nKey Takeaways:\nBlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech.\nIBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\nThe fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025.\nThe performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand.\n\nNate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.\nThe latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival.\nBlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This Nuclear Stock Could Turn $1,000 Into $100,000\n\nSteven Porrello, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:25 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OKLO\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Oklo is a pre-revenue nuclear start-up that needs a NRC license to turn its idea into profits.\nThe company's microreactors could be a billion dollar idea if data center demand stays hot.\nTo grow one-hundred-fold, Oklo would have to become a trillion dollar company, which would likely only happen over a long period.\n10 stocks we like better than Oklo ›\n\nEarly investors in Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) who held on to their shares through the flat and rocky months of 2024 have seen a triple-digit gain since last year.\nIndeed, after losing more than 50% on its first day of trading (May 10, 2024), Oklo stock has rebounded more than tenfold, beating heavyweight AI favorites, like Nvidia , Palantir , Alphabet , and Microsoft , plus the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the same period.\nPut differently: If you had invested $10,000 in Oklo near the end of its May 10 debut, you would have about $100,000 right now. At one point in October, that same holdings would have been worth well over $200,000.\nWith a 280% gain on the year, Oklo may seem like old news. And yet if you believe in the future of artificial intelligence (AI), this stock's incredible run may only be the beginning.\nCan Oklo turn $1,000 into $100,000? Oklo isn't your average nuclear company.\nThe Sam Altman-backed start-up is designing a microreactor (\"Aurora powerhouse\") that can supply on-site power to remote areas.\nUnlike traditional nuclear power plants, which are expensive and can take a decade to finish building, Oklo's Auroras are factory-built and can be deployed faster than large reactors. That makes them ideal for data center operators, who often build in rural areas where grid power would be severely strained by their electricity needs.\n\nBut here's something to consider: If Oklo turns $1,000 into $100,000, it would join the trillion-dollar club. That's a pretty tall order for any start-up, let alone one that will operate in the utilities sector.\nWhile a one-hundred-fold gain isn't impossible, it would likely take years, if not decades, to happen. Meanwhile, the utilities sector is expected to grow only about 5% annually. Even if Oklo can turn on its first plants, it would need to scale beyond that utility sector growth.\nAt this point, I'd size an Oklo position small; if its reactors work, it could matter over the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oklo right now? Before you buy stock in Oklo, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oklo wasn’t one of them.

Large companies , such as Nvidia and Alphabet, are enjoying strong gains, while companies like Palantir Technologies and CoreWeave are attracting investor attention and gaining at even faster rates.\nIt remains to be seen whether this trend will continue in 2026, but it appears likely. If you have $1,000 available to invest and are looking for a top AI stock to buy right now, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is a no-brainer.\nThe foundation of all AI What sets Taiwan Semi apart from almost any other AI stock is that it manufactures the chips designed by other companies. It's the manufacturer for the brand names, the foundation of their development. It's not the only game in town, but it developed the industry, and it's the biggest: It's been responsible for around 85% of semiconductor start-up product prototypes, and it has a 34% market share in the foundry business, which enables the fabrication of semiconductors.\n\nIt has contracts with nearly all the chip designers that are changing the world through AI. These are names like Nvidia, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices . These companies are continually developing more powerful chips, and their trusted partner, Taiwan Semiconductor, is experiencing strong growth as a result.\nAs hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft pour billions of dollars into data centers and AI development, they require more chips. Regardless of which chipmaker they're working with, they're likely to count on TSMC as a partner at some point.\nThe company has expanded its operations and now has a U.S. presence in Arizona. The very first chip that came off the line was an Nvidia Blackwell chip in October, marking a significant win for both companies. It's already investing $165 billion in Arizona alone, and it's looking to expand into new U.S. facilities over the next few years, setting itself up for many years of growth. This is an important development, not only because it expands the company's capabilities, but it also allows it to get around the tariffs that have been so challenging for many companies doing business in the U.S. recently.\n\nStory Continues\nMore than AI Aside from its client diversification, which is an excellent feature, it's also diversified by industry. It's benefiting from the tailwinds of AI growth, but it has been around a lot longer than the recent AI craze. It manufactures chips for various types of technology, including smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and AI. It works with 500 companies, and its semiconductors power 12,000 different products.\n\nHowever, AI is definitely giving the company a big boost. High-performance computing, which includes AI products, accounted for 57% of total revenue in the third quarter. Total revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% since going public in 1994. That is an outstanding performance, and it has accelerated recently; revenue was up 40.8% year over year in the third quarter. However, its highest-growing industries are Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphones.\nA stock price that's ready to jump A great stock is one that you can buy any time; the earlier the better. Taiwan Semiconductor has tremendous growth drivers and opportunities, making it a no-brainer choice for long-term growth.\nHowever, December appears to be an auspicious time to buy shares, as the stock has remained relatively stable over the past few months and is up 46% year to date. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings in January, and the stock is likely to jump on positive results, giving you the chance to buy in before the next rise.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Alphabet\n\nRobert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Alphabet were criticized for their AI results to date, but they are turning that around.\nApple delivered record revenue in its 2025 fiscal year and brought on new AI leadership.\nAlphabet's application of AI is driving growth across its businesses, such as increased usage of its search engine.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nTech titans Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) were rivals during the rise of the smartphone era. However, the arrival of a new technological marvel, artificial intelligence (AI) , has led to the pair teaming up.\nNews reports indicate Apple is going to license Alphabet's Gemini AI model to power its Siri voice assistant at a cost of $1 billion annually. This would be a win for Alphabet, whose stock has been a boon for shareholders as the share price soared nearly 60% in 2025 through Dec. 18. In that time, Apple stock was up about 9%.\nThat said, Apple shares hit an all-time high of $288.62 on Dec. 3, despite previous media perceptions that it's an AI laggard. So, which of these tech goliaths will prove the superior investment amid the age of AI? Let's dig into both companies to find out.\nApple's steady AI push Apple proved the AI revolution is a marathon, not a sprint, when it wrapped up its 2025 fiscal year, ended Sept. 27, with record revenue, despite a choppy push into artificial intelligence. The company reported sales of $416.2 billion, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nThis result was helped by record revenue of $102.5 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, which contributed to strong 13% year-over-year growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.85. The performance shows Apple didn't need a splashy AI solution to sell products.\n\nHowever, the company realizes its artificial intelligence offerings must continue to improve. It brought in new AI leadership in December, replacing its head of AI strategy with Amar Subramanya. Subramanya comes to Apple with years of experience helping Microsoft and Alphabet build their artificial intelligence capabilities. About this switch, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said, \"We believe that this was a major reset ... to get Apple on the right track when it comes to AI.\"\nEven so, the company is already viewed as a rival in the AI space. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, called Apple a major competitor. He sees hardware that supports AI, rather than software, as the battleground for artificial intelligence leadership.\nIn this regard, Apple is making strides. In October, it released the M5 chip, which was designed to deliver the kind of powerful computing performance needed to support AI on its devices.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet's intensified AI focus Like Apple, fellow tech titan Alphabet was seen as struggling to succeed in artificial intelligence after early stumbles in the space. The Google parent made changes to its organization last year to improve its AI approach.\nThis effort culminated in the November launch of the company's Gemini 3, its most advanced AI yet. The new artificial intelligence model can pick up subtle clues, allowing it to better understand the intent behind a user's Google search.\n\nWhile Gemini 3's impact won't be known until Q4 results are announced in 2026, the company is already benefiting from its AI efforts to date. According to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, \"AI is driving an expansionary moment for Search,\" explaining that the AI embedded in Google \"is already driving incremental total query growth for Search.\"\nConsequently, Google search revenue hit $56.6 billion in Q3, an increase from $49.4 billion in 2024. This helped Alphabet grow Q3 sales by 16% year over year to $102.3 billion.\nThat's just the start. AI acts as the brains behind many Alphabet products, including its self-driving car business, Waymo. Here, \"Waymo clearly is scaling up, particularly in 2026,\" Pichai said. Its service is expanding to London next year, adding to its Tokyo operations, which were Waymo's first steps internationally.\n\nPicking between Apple and Alphabet stocks Apple and Alphabet still have many years of growth to look forward to in the hot field of artificial intelligence. The AI industry is projected to achieve a phenomenal 25-fold expansion within a decade, growing from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033.\nGiven their proven revenue growth in the face of AI competition, such as ChatGPT, investing in both companies is ideal. But if you had to choose one, Alphabet has an edge over Apple when it comes to share price valuation.\nHere's a look at each stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which reflects what investors are paying for every dollar of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\nAlphabet's earnings multiple has been lower than Apple's throughout 2025 and continues to be so despite a rise in its P/E ratio over recent weeks. This makes it a better value over the iPhone maker.\nWith its new Gemini 3 AI model now live, Alphabet could see further strong sales growth in 2026 as it continues to expand its already promising AI capabilities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

I think it might be.\nThe leader in artificial intelligence ( AI ) computer chips is unlikely to give up all its gains from the last few years, but it is facing increasing competition, a high starting valuation, and the potential of near-term overspending to build out AI infrastructure. That makes the stock risky for 2026.\nThat doesn't mean you should dump your entire position. However, if you are thinking of buying AI stocks in 2026, there are two companies I believe will finish the year with larger market caps than Nvidia: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Here's why both are better buys than Nvidia today.\nAlphabet's AI comeback Alphabet is the conglomerate that owns Google, YouTube, Android, Waymo, and other technology properties. It is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, with billions of users across multiple product lines.\nThe stock was deemed a potential AI loser after ChatGPT came out and rapidly began taking market share of search and AI queries, with Alphabet falling flat-footed after the launch. Now, with the launch of updated Gemini AI models for text, images, and video creation (among other things), Alphabet is steadily gaining market share back from OpenAI and ChatGPT.\n\nIts stock has begun to perform because of it. Alphabet stock is up 60% year to date (YTD), which is more than double the returns of Nvidia. It is growing revenue at 15% year over year in constant currency, and with expanding profit margins. The durability of Google Search and YouTube, fast growth at Google Cloud, and long-term plays with Gemini and Waymo's self-driving cars should help Alphabet keep compounding its earnings power for years to come.\nAmazon's dual engines Alphabet's growth path in 2026 is clear. Amazon's will be determined by management's ability to wrangle costs that spiraled out of control during the pandemic years, which is a headwind still impacting the business.\nAmazon's cloud computing division -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- grew revenue 20% year over year last quarter, with a fat 36% operating margin over the last 12 months. Cloud computing is benefiting from the AI infrastructure expansion, with Amazon specifically helped by the likes of its partner Anthropic, a start-up growing incredibly quickly that Amazon is also an investor in. OpenAI is in talks with Amazon about a $10 billion investment that would likely flow back through to AWS cloud computing spending.\n\nStory Continues\nYou have a 36% operating margin at AWS. In retail, Amazon is still growing strongly, with double-digit growth in the last few years in North America and internationally. Advertising, third-party seller services, and subscription revenue now generate $279 billion in trailing revenue, or 40% of Amazon's total revenue. These segments have high profit margins and have been growing faster than the overall Amazon retail business.\n\nAnd yet Amazon's retail operations in North America only have a 6.6% operating margin. This could be looked at as a failure or a future path to profit expansion. Amazon has been trimming its ranks through layoffs, which should help margins expand throughout 2026 and beyond. If retail can keep up this operating leverage, along with the fast growth at AWS, then Amazon's profitability will explode in 2026.\nThe math: Why Amazon and Alphabet will be worth more than Nvidia Today, Alphabet generates $128 billion in operating income, Nvidia $110 billion, and Amazon $80 billion. Nvidia's revenue is currently growing much faster than both of these businesses, but that could come to a grinding halt if the AI infrastructure buildout slows down in 2026.\nNvidia's revenue growth doesn't have to go negative in order for earnings to fall, as it is currently implementing huge price increases for its products that are generating incredibly high profit margins. Plus, its stock trades at a more expensive earnings ratio than both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nIf Nvidia's revenue growth slows down in 2026 while Alphabet and Amazon keep chugging along, then Nvidia's earnings will likely fall along with its high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That could lead both stocks to finish 2026 with market caps larger than Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Analyst upgrades viral crypto stock's price target after billion-dollar deals\n\nPooja Rajkumari\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:18 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: HUT\n\nBTC-USD\n\nGOOG\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nBitcoin mining companies are increasingly realising the benefits of pivoting to AI.\nRecently, analyst Mark Palmer from Benchmark raised the price target for Bitcoin-miner-turned-AI company Hut 8.\nThe change in price target was due to the company’s latest push into AI data center development, which represents a step-change in the quality and durability of its cash flows.\n\nRelated: Despite bitcoin price dip, mining difficulty hits an all-time high\nAI deal drives target increase According to Palmer, Hut 8’s recent agreement with Anthropic and Fluidstack stands apart from comparable AI co-location deals announced by other digital infrastructure providers. Palmer cited the structure of the transaction, the quality of the counterparties, and the embedded downside protection as key differentiators.\n\nHut 8 announced on Dec. 17 that it would partner with Anthropic and Fluidstack to accelerate the deployment of hyperscale AI infrastructure in the United States.\nThe agreement includes a financial backstop from Google, which guarantees lease payment obligations for the base term.\nUnder the agreement, Hut 8 will develop and deliver at least 245 megawatts and up to 2,295 megawatts of AI data center capacity for Anthropic, supported by high-performance compute clusters operated by Fluidstack.\nAlongside the partnership announcement, Hut 8 disclosed a 15-year, triple-net lease with Fluidstack for the initial River Bend capacity.\nThe lease carries a base value of roughly $7 billion, includes a 3% annual rent escalator, and offers three five-year renewal options that could lift the total contract value to approximately $17.7 billion.\n\nHut 8 stock jumped nearly 4% in regular trading on Dec. 16, closing at $36.85. After the announcement, it climbed more than 21% in premarket trading the following morning to $44.60.\nAt press time, Hut 8 was up 17.78%, trading at $51.96. Year-to-date data reveal the stock has climbed about 138% as of Dec. 23.\nMore News: US introduces new bill to fix tax loopholes in crypto\nAndrew Tate says he can sell house for crypto\nMajor S&P 500 company pledges $1,000 per child\nLong-term lease de-risks cash flows Benchmark highlighted the triple-net structure with Fluidstack as a key positive.\nA triple-net lease, often written as an NNN lease, is a commercial real estate agreement where the tenant, not the landlord, pays nearly all property-related expenses in addition to base rent. The expenses include property taxes, insurance, operational costs, and maintenance.\nIn the Hut 8's case, Fluidstack is responsible for carrying the burden of paying the property expenses.\n\nStory Continues\nPalmer also pointed to a payment backstop provided by Google, which he said materially reduces counterparty risk and improves the predictability of the contracted cash flows.\nHut 8 has retained full economic ownership of the asset while avoiding equity issuance or warrants.\nBenchmark estimates the initial River Bend tranche alone is worth about $7.6 billion, reflecting both contracted revenues and the scarcity of AI-ready power backed by an investment-grade counterparty.\n\nPalmer changed the price target for Hut 8 to $85 from $78. The firm reiterated a “buy” rating in a note published on Dec. 22.\nRelated: How the halving will, or won't, impact publicly-traded bitcoin miners\nBitcoin exposure remains through ABTC Despite the growing AI footprint, Hut 8 maintains significant exposure to Bitcoin through its majority ownership of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.'s American Bitcoin Corp. (NASDAQ: ABTC). Hut 8 owns roughly 80% of ABTC , effectively positioning it as a core subsidiary within a shared Bitcoin-focused ecosystem.\n\nABTC relies on Hut 8’s data centers, energy infrastructure, and operational expertise to mine Bitcoin, allowing it to scale production and accumulate BTC without building standalone facilities. Strategically, this structure enables Hut 8 to pair long-duration, contracted AI revenues with leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s upside.\nRelated: Bitcoin miners adapt to volatile markets with flexible cost strategies\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Trading News & Analysis section.

OpenAI was clearly in the lead with their chat GPT and latest GPT models, but that all seemed to change this year with the release of Gemini 3 just recently. Uh now companies are saying that they're more interested in Gemini 3. Uh we're also seeing some growth numbers out of Gemini 3 that are really starting to give a little bit of push back against Chat GPT as the leader in that space.\n00:41 Dan\nIn fact, uh Deep Water Asset Management managing partner Jean Munster wrote that Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in calendar year 26. And, you know, this is all coming uh as Google continues to push forward with its AI models. And, you know, it's important to note that while Google is ahead now, it doesn't mean that it's going to be ahead forever. Uh OpenAI launched their own red alert, something that Google had to do when OpenAI initially launched Chat GPT back in 2022. And so they've managed to catch up and then some at this point, and we'll just have to see what that means then for OpenAI.\n01:13 Speaker A\nWhat Dan would you say is Google's secret weapon or weapons with OpenAI? You know, would it be Dan, you know, would you focus on distribution there with with search and Chrome and Android?\n01:31 Dan\nYeah, I mean there's a number of things, right? Uh at first uh glance, there's Android, as you said, you can use Gemini on an Android phone right away. You don't need to download uh an app, you don't need to go to a website. That's kind of a a friction point for people versus Chat PT, which requires you to download an app uh or go to the web unless you're using something uh like Apple Intelligence, which has Chat GPT built in, but it's not necessarily something you can use regularly on the fly.\n02:04 Dan\nUh they also have the ability to make money, right? They're bringing in cash flow positive because they have their advertising business. They have their Google cloud platform business. They uh have YouTube and so they have all of these different points where they can pull revenue from and then put that money to work, whereas OpenAI has more than a trillion dollars of uh commitments for spending over the next few years, but they're not cash flow positive at this point. Sure, they have revenue, but it's not overcoming the amount that they have to spend.\n02:40 Dan\nUh and so you could see that that kind of back and forth between, you know, okay, uh OpenAI obviously an innovative company, Google a long-standing uh tech juggernat, invented the technology behind uh these transformer models, uh and now standing on top. Um, you know, it it's beyond their AI as well. They also uh won kind of uh a ruling in their one of their anti-trust cases where they uh weren't forced to give up Chrome and they could still enter into uh deals where they allow companies like Apple uh to distribute Google's uh search on their devices. And so, you know, they were winning on legal fronts, uh you know, to a degree, Waymo is also a big win as well. They're now doing freeway driving and things of that nature, expanding to more cities.\n03:40 Dan\nuh and then again, just on AI, they continue to seem to dominate uh at this point. But as I said, that doesn't mean it's going to be that way in 2026. OpenAI is going to be working on better models and Anthropic is also working on better models. So it's going to be this continuous back and forth, but for now, it appears that Google's in the lead.\n04:06 Speaker A\nDan, thank you.

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Deliver Market-Beating Gains Through 2030\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet has created a huge flywheel advantage that should just grow over time.\nIts edge comes from having its own world class custom AI chips and models under the same roof.\nThis advantage should only increase over time, helping the stock produce market-beating returns for years to come.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nOne of the best-positioned artificial intelligence (AI) stocks for several years is undoubtedly Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . The stock has had a strong year, but its momentum could just be beginning.\nLet's look at why the stock could deliver market-beating returns through 2030.\nAlphabet's flywheel advantage Heading into this year, Alphabet was pegged by the investment community as a probable AI loser. For the first time in a long time, its core Google search business was facing a big potential competitive threat with AI. Investors believed that chatbots, like those from OpenAI and Anthropic, could displace search, while AI-powered search from the likes of Perplexity added further competition.\n\nHowever, Alphabet was able to flip the script in 2025. It was able to raise the level of its Gemini large language model (LLM) to become one of the best AI models available. Meanwhile, it also integrated Gemini throughout its products, including Google search. It started with AI-powered features like AI Overviews and new multimodal ways to search, such as Circle to Search and Lens, that went beyond typing in search keywords. Then it introduced an entire AI Mode built right into Google search where users could easily toggle between traditional search and AI chatbot answers.\nThis ultimately creates a more frictionless experience that doesn't ask people to change what they are accustomed to doing. That's a powerful advantage that is only amplified by the distribution edge that Alphabet holds. Google search is already the default search engine on almost every device on the planet, outside of China, where it does not operate. The company owns both the world's most popular smartphone operating system and web browser, each of which has a more than 70% market share. Meanwhile, it has a search revenue-sharing deal with Apple to be the default search engine on its devices, covering much of the rest of the population that doesn't use Chrome or Android.\nInstead of seeing its search revenue shrink from increased competition, it has instead started to accelerate. As the company taps into its vast ad network and begins to find ways to monetize AI even more, this growth should only continue to accelerate.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Alphabet's biggest weapon is its custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). The company developed these custom chips more than a decade ago, and they help run most of Alphabet's internal workloads. As an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), they are preprogrammed to specifically handle tasks optimized for Google's TensorFlow framework and more recently, other frameworks, such as JAX and PyTorch. (That last part is actually important, as it opens the door for it to sell TPUs directly to companies like Anthropic, which uses PyTorch.) Notably, though, it's more than just the hardware, as Alphabet has also designed and integrated its software (like its XLA compilers) around these chips.\n\nAs such, they can outperform general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) at these specific tasks, while also being more energy efficient. This gives Alphabet a huge structural cost advantage against competitors that rely almost solely on Nvidia 's expensive GPUs. Not only are its chips cheaper, but they are also more cost effective to use, which will only become more important as more people use AI and total inference costs rise.\nHaving both less expensive training and inference costs creates a virtuous cycle for Alphabet. It's getting more bang for its buck with its spending on training, which makes its models better, which gets more people to adopt Gemini, which lets it funnel more money to make its AI models better, and so on. Meanwhile, it also gives its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, a big edge, as it can also offer customers more cost-effective options than training and running inference on Nvidia-based servers. This should allow it to capture higher gross margins and have a higher return on investment (ROI) on its capital expenditures (capex) spending than competitors.\n\nWhy the stock will outperform Alphabet is just starting to see the rewards of the flywheel effect it has created, and the benefits should just widen over time. Amazon and Microsoft have developed their own custom chips, but they are not yet at the level of TPUs, and it will take many years to catch up to have the same level of software-to-hardware integration. Meanwhile, OpenAI's custom chip efforts are still in the development stage, and it doesn't have the same level of distribution or ad network as Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet is the only company with both world class AI chips and models, which sets it up to be one of the biggest AI winners and for its stock to have market-beating returns in the years ahead.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

Thanks for having me, Josh.\n00:22 Eric\nUh there's a lot of great momentum.\n00:27 Eric\nI think um the questions are simply one, valuation, right? And we and we know that.\n00:36 Eric\nUm concentration, right? We know that the top 10 stocks in the S&P now account for 40% of the value of the S&P.

And then of course with AI, look, AI is real. This is a game changer. It's going to change the world.\n01:20 Eric\nBut a lot of this is definitely focused on Open AI.

It's going to get tougher. Maybe it's the mag 3 or four.\n02:04 Eric\nUh it's a great question. I mean, look, we're not stock pickers at the Wealth Alliance, we're more asset allocators.\n02:10 Eric\nI think if you own the Mag 7, I think you're going to be okay. Let's not forget, the Mag 7 the last decade has grown its earnings 20-fold.\n02:19 Eric\nThat is a 35% compounded versus about 8% for the S&P.\n02:25 Eric\nI think it's okay to have Mag 7 exposure and you should. My concern is when I see a lot of new clients are coming into the firm, they're just loaded up in tech.\n02:34 Eric\nAnd they're not diversified. And I'm I just hit my 40th anniversary doing this. and I remember 1999 and 2000, seeing the same thing. People just loaded up in the same stocks. That was just gets me all nervous. Stay diversified.

Securing access to energy that powers data centers has become a critical part of training AI models.\n\nAlphabet previously held a minority stake in Intersect Power after Google and TPG Rise Climate led an $800 million strategic funding round in the company last December. That partnership set a target of $20 billion in total investment by 2030.\nThe acquisition includes Intersect’s future development projects but excludes its existing operation, which will be bought out by other investors and managed as a separate company.\nIntersect’s new data parks, which are essentially locations next to wind, solar, and battery power, are expected to be operational late next year and fully completed by 2027, Google said when it announced its minority investment.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year.\nGoogle will be the primary user. However, Intersect’s campuses are designed as industrial parks that can host other companies’ AI chips alongside Google’s.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company plans to employ neutral particle beams and magnets in its fusion reactors instead of standard lasers.\nWidely regarded as the Holy Grail of low-carbon electricity, nuclear fusion works by &lsquo;smashing&rsquo; together hydrogen atoms to create helium and release energy through the famous E=MC2 mass-energy equivalence. Fusion is the process by which stars, including our own sun, generate vast amounts of energy in their cores.\n\nNuclear fusion is able to generate four times as much energy as nuclear fission from the same mass of fuel. Fusion reactors are highly regarded not only because of their massive power output but also because they produce much less radioactive waste and cannot melt down, unlike fission reactors, where uncontrolled chain reactions can be catastrophic.\nNuclear fission is a process where a nucleus (usually of a heavy atom like uranium) splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy and additional neutrons. These released neutrons can then induce further fission events, leading to a chain reaction.\nAfter a long period of stagnation, nuclear fusion is hot again thanks to the ongoing global nuclear renaissance amid surging energy demand. Back in August, Sam Altman-backed Helion Energy began construction of its first commercial nuclear fusion plant in Chelan County, Washington. Helion&rsquo;s project has already undergone rigorous environmental assessments as part of the Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) process by the State of Washington.\n\nTwo years ago, Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Helion Energy to buy electricity from the nuclear fusion startup beginning in 2028. Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) was appointed as the marketer for the zero-carbon electricity Helion plans to generate at its Orion plant.\n\nStory Continues\nHelion has scored some important fusion milestones, with its Trenta prototype the first private reactor to achieve nuclear fusion on a commercial scale. Trenta--Helion&rsquo;s sixth fusion prototype--has been able to achieve a critical fuel temperature of 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, widely considered a benchmark for commercial fusion viability.\n\nTesting of the prototype began in 2019 and concluded in January 2023, during which the facility completed nearly 10,000 high-power pulses and operated under vacuum for 16 months. Trenta uses a pulsed magneto-inertial fusion (MIF) approach to generate fusion energy. It accelerates two Field Reversed Configurations (FRCs) of plasma to collide, compressing them to fusion temperatures and directly recapturing the released energy as electricity, bypassing the traditional steam turbine cycle.\nChina Enters Fusion Race\nThat said, China has entered the fusion race with a bang. Whereas the U.S. was among the world&rsquo;s first countries to bet big on this futuristic gambit, China&rsquo;s foray came much later. China has been making rapid progress over the past decade, and now owns more fusion patents than any country according to industry data published by Nikkei. Further, China is building projects at record speed.\n\nChina's private fusion energy company, Energy Singularity , has achieved several significant breakthroughs in developing high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tokamak devices aimed at accelerating the commercialization of fusion energy. In June 2024, the company's HH70 device successfully achieved its \"first plasma,\" making it the first and only operational full high-temperature superconducting tokamak built by a commercial company globally. The HH70 device was designed and constructed in under two years, a world record for the fastest development and construction of a superconducting tokamak.\nIn early 2025, Energy Singularity's large-bore D-shaped HTS magnet, named \"Jingtian\" generated a world-record magnetic field of 21.7 tesla in a test. This surpassed the previous record held by a U.S. company/MIT collaboration and is a critical step for developing smaller, more cost-effective fusion reactors.The company is now developing its next-generation device, the HH170, which is planned for completion by 2027 and aims to achieve a tenfold energy gain (Q>10), a crucial milestone for commercial viability.\n\nInterestingly, just like it did with AI models, China is pulling off impressive fusion milestones with much less. To wit, Energy Singularity has so far received just $112 million in private investment, significantly less than U.S. fusion startups. For some context, Charles Seife, director of the Arthur L. Carter Institute of Journalism at New York University, estimates that France-based International Thermonuclear Experimental Reacto r (ITER) project costs have surpassed &euro;20 billion ($21.8 billion), more than four times the original budget of &euro;5 billion (then $5.5 billion) and nearly a decade late from its 2016 delivery date.\nThat said, Energy Singularity is not the only fusion startup that&rsquo;s pursuing small reactor designs. Deven, Massachusetts-based Commonwealth Fusion Systems is collaborating with MIT to build its small fusion reactor.\n\nThe company has achieved major breakthroughs in fusion energy by developing world-record High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnets, enabling smaller, more powerful tokamaks like their SPARC device, which aims to be the first to produce net energy. They've secured massive funding (around $3 billion), validated their magnet technology with the U.S. DOE, and demonstrated key magnet performance milestones. CFS is now building its SPARC reactor to prove net-energy fusion, paving the way for its first commercial power plant, ARC.\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nAdani Explores Nuclear Power Foray With 16 GW Small Reactor Project\nPutin Lashes Out as EU Agrees to Loan $105 Billion to Ukraine\nIraqi Crude Can&rsquo;t Replace Venezuelan Oil in the U.S. Market\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

Alphabet's (GOOGL) self-driving unit, Waymo, saw several vehicles stall during San Francisco's power outage, causing traffic disruptions but luckily no injuries. Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed the incident on X, posting video footage and stating that \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"\n\nLooking back, Tesla stock has tended to outperform in December , historically, finishing the month higher in seven of the past 10 years. Additional record highs may be in the cards, as today's peak comes amid low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for TSLA in the past.\nAccording to data from Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been two instances in the past five years when Tesla stock traded within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer’s Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th percentile, or lower, of its annual range -- as is the case with the security’s current SVI of 46%, which sits low in the 6th percentile of its annual range.\nIn both prior cases, Tesla stock was higher a month later after both of these signals, averaging a large 17% return. From its current perch, a move of similar magnitude would put the equity at $577.78.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Shares of content discovery platform Taboola (NASDAQ:TBLA) jumped 2.8% in the afternoon session after analyst firm Rosenblatt initiated coverage on the stock with a 'Buy' rating and a $6 price target.\nThe price target suggested a potential upside of nearly 50% from its previous closing price. According to the research firm, Taboola's shares had been \"mis-characterized as a secular loser from Google AI-search,\" which resulted in the stock's relatively flat performance over the previous year. This new bullish coverage indicated that investor concerns about competition from AI-driven search innovations may have been overstated, providing a more optimistic outlook for the company's future.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $4.17, up 3% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Taboola? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Taboola’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 3.3% on the news that a technical sell signal indicated the potential for further declines.\n\nThe downward move appeared to be driven by technical factors. A sell signal was reportedly issued from a recent peak, and the stock had fallen more than 3% since that point, suggesting further declines were possible. This technical pressure was compounded by negative insider sentiment. Over the previous year, key executives had sold a significant amount of shares on the open market, totaling $44.1 million against $16.1 million in shares bought or received.\nTaboola is up 11.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.17 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $4.18 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Taboola’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $347.08.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened.

Shares of solar panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) jumped 6% in the afternoon session after Alphabet announced it would acquire Intersect Power, a major customer that purchases First Solar's solar panels.\nAlphabet entered into an agreement to purchase the data center and energy infrastructure company for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of debt. Intersect Power was a major buyer of First Solar's thin-film solar panels, with significant multi-gigawatt orders placed in previous years. The deal likely boosted investor confidence as it secured a key customer relationship.\n\nThis news also followed other positive developments, including the recent inauguration of a $1.1 billion manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which was expected to significantly boost the company's solar panel production capacity.\nIs now the time to buy First Solar?

      "Content": "Alphabet Buying Clean Energy Developer to Support Data Centers\n\nContributed Content\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 11:36 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAlphabet, the parent of technology giant Google, has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Intersect, which provides data center and energy infrastructure solutions, for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of debt. Google already owns a minority stake in Intersect from a previously announced funding round. The acquisition announced December 22 will enable more data center and generation capacity to come online, faster, while accelerating energy development and innovation, Alphabet said in a news release. Included in the transaction are Intersect’s team and multiple gigawatts of energy and data center projects in development, or under construction, from its successful existing partnership with Google. Intersect will also explore a range of emerging technologies to increase and diversify energy supply, while supporting Google’s U.S. data center investments to meet its Cloud customers’ and users’ demand. Intersect’s operations will remain separate from Alphabet and Google under the Intersect brand and will be led by Sheldon Kimber. It will partner closely with Google’s technical infrastructure team, continuing work on in-development, and new, joint projects; this includes the companies’ first announced co-located data center and power site, under construction in Haskell County, Texas. Intersect’s existing operating assets in Texas, and its operating and in-development assets in California, will not be part of the acquisition. Those assets continue to operate as an independent company, supported by existing investors TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, and Greenbelt Capital Partners. Intersect expects a seamless transition and service continuity for customers of those assets. “Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership. We look forward to welcoming Sheldon and the Intersect team,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. “Intersect has always been focused on bringing innovation to the industry and we look forward to accelerating at scale as part of Google,” said Sheldon Kimber, founder and CEO, Intersect. “Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI. We share Google’s conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.”\n\nAdvancing U.S. Energy Innovation and Capacity The acquisition will augment Alphabet and Google’s ongoing commitment to partnering with utilities and energy developers across the sector to unlock abundant, reliable, affordable energy supply that enables the buildout of data center infrastructure without passing on costs to grid customers. Alphabet is committed to creating new pathways and partnerships to responsibly increase energy supply, while advancing the rapid commercialization of advanced energy technologies—including advanced geothermal, long duration energy storage, and natural gas with carbon capture and storage. Additionally, Alphabet is deploying artificial intelligence to accelerate the grid connection of new power plants and helping scale energy efficiency and affordability programs in data center communities. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions and anticipated to close in the first half of 2026. —This content was contributed by Alphabet .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

By 2026, the company expects to add 2,000 more.\n\nWaymo began operating fully autonomous vehicles in Miami on Nov. 18 and said it will start operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando “over the coming weeks, ahead of opening our doors to riders next year.”\nIt is also “returning” to Las Vegas and regularly testing in Detroit during winter weather , and spreading its fleet of more than 200 vehicles to new locations seemingly every month.\nBut the Alphabet-backed company is also facing issues such as a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probe into the autonomous vehicles for “traffic safety violations relating to stopping when encountering a school bus, particularly when the bus is boarding or offboarding students.”\nBut recently, some of Waymo's biggest issues have arisen in the company's home city of San Francisco.\nSan Francisco power outage temporarily stops Waymo autonomous vehicles Waymo currently operates a fleet of approximately 2,000 vehicles on U.S. roads.\nApproximately 800 of those autonomous vehicles are operating in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to data the company shared with the San Francisco Examiner in August , making the City by the Bay the company's unofficial center of operations.\n\nRelated: Waymo customer swears off autonomous driving after close call\nHowever, the company recently experienced a significant issue in its hometown.\nIn a viral video from No Safe Words on X ( formerly Twitter ), it looked like an endless line of Waymos had taken over one city street on Nov. 22. The company says the vehicles were all headed to a “mass hailing event” in the video, causing the bottleneck that was filmed.\nThis weekend, the company experienced an even more disruptive event after its San Francisco fleet was unable to navigate the terrain during a massive blackout in the city, which has a population of more than 800,000.\nWaymo was forced to suspend service in San Francisco, as apparently its vehicles did not know the \"four-way-stop\" rule that applies to intersections with inoperable traffic lights.\n\nStory Continues\nThe vehicles were filmed stuck at numerous intersections , unsure how to navigate the situation , causing even more turmoil on the roads as drivers slowly inch past electricity-less city blocks.\nA fire caused the outage, which affected 130,000 citizens in the city.\n“The sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion,” Waymo said in a statement as it temporarily shut down operations in the city.\n\nWaymo restores San Francisco service, but can it restore customer faith in the company? While Waymo suspended the service on Saturday, Dec. 20, by 7 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Waymo said it was resuming service in the region.\nAs for the passengers caught in the vehicles during the disruption, Waymo says \"the majority of active trips were completed before vehicles returned to depots or pulled over,\" so at least \"the majority\" of passengers weren't left stranded.\n\nRelated: Waymo pulls ahead of Tesla Robotaxi, Amazon Zoox with latest move\nWaymo says its vehicles represent a 91% reduction in serious injury or worse crashes, a 79% decrease in airbag deployment crashes, and an 80% decrease in injury-causing crashes.\nWaymo is also safer for non-drivers, with 92% fewer pedestrian crashes resulting in injuries, 78% fewer cyclist crashes resulting in injuries, and 89% fewer motorcycle crashes resulting in injuries.\nBut good luck to Waymo convincing San Franciscans, and other Californians, about those numbers after the recent high-profile incidents in the city.\nNearly 80% of California voters support requiring a human safety operator in self-driving trucks and delivery vehicles, and just 33% of voters express a favorable general impression of autonomous vehicles.\n\n“We are increasingly bringing AI from the digital world to the physical world, and it’s critically important that we do that in a very careful and considerate way,” Rowan Stone, CEO of AI data training company Sapien, told TheStreet.\nSapien currently works with Waymo rival Zoox.\n“What we can do better as an entire industry is resist the urge to move quickly and break things, especially when you’re dealing with a hunk of metal that could potentially kill people,” he said.\nWaymo issues extend beyond San Francisco San Francisco isn't the only city where Waymo has had to temporarily pause operations in recent weeks.\nOn Dec. 1, after Waymo received its 20th citation from the Austin Independent School District for the current school year, Austin ISD decided to release the video of the previous infractions to the public.\n\nBy Dec. 5, Waymo announced that it would file for a voluntary recall after videos of the company's robotaxis committing traffic violations while operating in school bus zones went viral.\nThe Austin ISD had been in private contact with the company, but as the incidences of Waymos driving through school bus stop signs piled up (eventually averaging 1.5 per week), the Austin ISD decided to go public.\n“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” said Muaricio Peña, chief security officer for Waymo.\nBack in California, Waymos have been recorded piling up at Santa Monica charging stations at night in Southern California.\n\nA video , posted on X by Nic Cruz Patane, shows a seemingly endless line of lifeless robots waiting to be charged, is eerily similar to the video from San Francisco.\nOn Nov. 24, the city formally demanded Waymo cease overnight operations at its two local autonomous vehicle charging facilities.\nThe move comes after months of noise complaints from nearby residents, according to the Santa Monica Daily Press . The directive was unanimously approved in a 6-0 City Council vote on Nov. 18, but now the city is demanding that property owners, lessees, and operators immediately stop nighttime operations due to nuisance conditions at the two charging sites.\nResidents in the neighborhood have complained about the constant noise and disruption caused by the 24-hour operations, with some deliberately blocking the vehicles’ entry and exit. They have been bothered by everything from the legally mandated backup alarms to other vehicle noises that have become incessant.\n\nIn a statement, Waymo said it has been listening to community input and is “committed to continuing to operate and invest” in Santa Monica. It says it has adjusted operations at the site in response to community feedback and that it will continue to seek community input.\nRelated: Waymo pumps the brakes as dangerous issue comes to light\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

      "Content": "Google's parent buys data center energy specialist Intersect for $4.75 billion to help power AI\n\nAssociated Press Finance\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:12 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif . (AP) — Google's corporate parent on Monday announced an agreement to buy data center energy specialist Intersect for $4.75 billion as part of its effort to secure the vast amounts of electricity needed to power artificial intelligence technology.\nAlphabet, which depends on Google's search engine and other online services for most of its revenue, is buying out Intersect in its entirety after purchasing a stake in the San Francisco-based startup a year ago. Intersect had previously raised $2.1 billion from Google and other early investors.\n\nAfter the acquisition is completed during the first half of next year, Alphabet intends to allow Intersect to operate independently while continuing its efforts to secure the energy sources needed for the sprawling data centers being built to power the AI services rolling out from Google and rivals such as OpenAI .\nThe power-hungry data centers, which are being likened to AI factories, is fueling a backlash in communities where residents have been interpreting their steadily rising electricity bills as evidence that they help helping footing the boom for a technology boom that could still go bust.\nIntersect focuses on finding ways to increase and diversify the supply of energy in an effort to keep hold down power costs. It's already working on a data center for Mountain View, California-based Alphabet in Haskell County, Texas.\nGoogle's inroads with AI has helped increase Alphabet's stock price by more than 60% so far this year, generating an additional $1.4 trillion in shareholder wealth.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Alphabet to acquire Intersect for $4.75 billion to boost data center capacity\n\nVlad Schepkov\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Google’s parent Alphabet announced Monday it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Intersect, a provider of data center and energy infrastructure solutions, for $4.75 billion in cash plus the assumption of debt.\nGoogle already owns a minority stake in Intersect from a previous funding round. The acquisition aims to enable more data center and generation capacity to come online faster while accelerating energy development and innovation.\n\nThe deal includes Intersect’s team and multiple gigawatts of energy and data center projects currently in development or under construction from its existing partnership with Google. Intersect will explore emerging technologies to increase energy supply while supporting Google’s U.S. data center investments to meet Cloud customer demand.\nUnder the agreement, Intersect’s operations will remain separate from Alphabet and Google, continuing under the Intersect brand with Sheldon Kimber as leader. The company will work closely with Google’s technical infrastructure team on ongoing and new joint projects, including their first co-located data center and power site being built in Haskell County, Texas.\nIntersect’s existing operating assets in Texas and its operating and in-development assets in California will not be included in the acquisition. These assets will continue to operate as an independent company, backed by investors TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, and Greenbelt Capital Partners.\n\n\"Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.\nSheldon Kimber, founder and CEO of Intersect, stated: \"Intersect has always been focused on bringing innovation to the industry and we look forward to accelerating at scale as part of Google. Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI. We share Google’s conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.\"\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2026.\nRelated articles\nAlphabet to acquire Intersect for $4.75 billion to boost data center capacity\nLoading Up HEAVY on These 3 Stocks by End of 2025 (+ 1 New ETF)\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "How Caterpillar Crushed the Magnificent 7 in 2025 — And It’s Not Done Yet!\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nQuick Read Caterpillar ( CAT ) rose 61% in 2025 to become the top Dow performer. Caterpillar outpaced six of the seven Magnificent 7 tech stocks.\nCaterpillar’s Energy and Transportation segment drove gains with Q3 power generation sales up 31% from AI data center demand.\nCaterpillar raised guidance to 5% to 7% annual sales growth through 2030 with adjusted operating margins reaching 21% to 25% at $100B sales.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate market headlines in 2025, many of the stocks most closely tied to the technology -- the Magnificent 7 stocks of Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) -- have shown volatility or lagged.\nSix of the seven have experienced mixed or negative returns at points throughout the year, with broad concerns over valuations, sector rotations, and sustainability weighing on performance. In contrast, one unexpected name has outperformed six of the seven: Caterpillar ( NYSE:CAT ), the heavy equipment manufacturer. On a total return basis (capital appreciation plus dividends), Caterpillar trails only Alphabet by about one percentage point or so as of last Friday's close. Yet less than two weeks ago, Caterpillar was even ahead of Alphabet in year-to-date gains.\n\nSo, how is a traditional industrial company easily outpacing some of the world's largest tech giants?\nCaterpillar's Strong 2025 Performance Caterpillar has risen approximately 61% in 2025 compared to Alphabet's roughly 62 % gain, leaving the heavy equipment manufacturer just behind the tech behemoth and with the potential to surpass it by year-end.\nIt also stands as the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , edging out Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) in second place, and significantly outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7, with only Nvidia, which has returned almost 35% this year, coming close.\n\nWhat Is Doing the Heavy Lifting for Caterpillar Caterpillar's outperformance stems from strong demand in its Energy and Transportation segment, particularly generators and power equipment for AI data centers and infrastructure. Partnerships like the one with Vertiv ( NYSE:VRT ) for data center power solutions have highlighted Caterpillar's role in supporting AI growth.\nEnduring global infrastructure spending and mining demand have also contributed, but the real standout has been in power generation and oil and gas, segments that saw sales rise 31% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nTariffs posed challenges earlier in the year, with estimated costs up to $1.8 billion in 2025, but the company mitigated impacts through cost controls and pricing adjustments. Still, inflation continues to weigh on margins, with consolidated operating profits slipping 3%.\nHowever, these drivers that carried Caterpillar higher in 2025 appear sustainable into 2026, with analysts pointing to ongoing AI-related power needs and potential infrastructure rebounds. The risks of tariff escalation and cyclical slowdowns in construction or mining remain present.\n\nKey Takeaway Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar often deliver the best returns when bought during downturns to capture upside as cycles recover. Caterpillar began rising in late 2022, gained strongly in 2023, and delivered about 24% returns in 2024. In 2025, shares faltered on tariff fears in April before doubling from those lows.\n\nAt this point in the cycle, Caterpillar remains a solid holding, with tailwinds from AI infrastructure and global demand likely continuing into next year and beyond. Their strength allowed management to raise guidance for the next five years.\nCaterpillar is now expecting 5% to 7% compound annual sales growth through 2030, adjusted operating margins of 15% to 19% at $60 billion in sales and 21% to 25% at $100 billion in sales, and $6 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow—a 20% to 50% increase over prior estimates. While valuations are elevated with the stock trading well above its five-year average across most metrics, the structural shift toward power generation supports further gains rather than an imminent peak.\nAI's strong tailwinds will likely carry Caterpillar stock beyond the typical cyclical decline, and though investors should monitor economic indicators and keep an eye on whether AI is truly in a bubble phase or not, taking profits now may be premature given the outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

This is more than 20 times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam.\nThe acquisition adds to a string of Alphabet's investments and partnerships in the energy ​space. Earlier this month, utility company NextEra expanded its partnership with Google ‌Cloud to build new energy supplies for the company's operations across the U.S.\n\nDEAL TERMS Google, along with TPG Rise Climate, backed Intersect as part of a more than $800 million funding round in December last year. That announcement also included plans to develop industrial parks for housing gigawatts of data center capacity co-located ⁠with new clean energy plants.\nIntersect's operations will remain ​separate from Alphabet. The company's existing operating assets ​in Texas and its operating and in-development assets in California will not be part of the acquisition and will operate as ‍an independent company, supported ⁠by existing investors, Alphabet said.\nIts Texas projects include Quantum, a clean energy storage system being built directly alongside a data center campus for ⁠Google.\nIntersect will also explore a range of emerging technologies to increase and diversify energy supply, while ‌supporting Google's U.S. data center investments, Alphabet said.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya ‌Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Waymo Pauses Bay Area Robotaxi Service After San Francisco Power Outage\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:50 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: PCG\n\nGOOG\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nRecent disruptions in San Francisco offered investors a real-world stress test for Waymo's autonomous ride-hailing platform, after a widespread power outage forced multiple driverless vehicles to stop mid-ride across the city. The outage, which stemmed from a fire at a PG&E ( NYSE:PCG ) substation, knocked out traffic lights at major intersections and at one point affected roughly 130,000 customers during a peak holiday shopping weekend. As stores closed and transit services were interrupted, Waymo vehicles operated by Alphabet Inc. were among the services impacted, with videos circulating online showing cars halted in the roadway with hazard lights flashing.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with PCG.\nIs PCG fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nOne rider, Michele Riva, described how his Waymo car continued driving through less crowded streets before stopping abruptly near a dense intersection with non-functioning traffic signals, leaving him without advance notice. As pedestrians crossed freely in the absence of traffic lights, Riva believed the vehicle may have defaulted to a conservative safety posture, possibly struggling to interpret the situation. After waiting several minutes for customer support amid heavy call volumes, he exited the vehicle and walked the remaining distance, later noting that while the experience was unpleasant, the decision to stop may have been driven by safety considerations.\n\nBy Sunday morning, PG&E Corp. said power had been restored to about 110,000 customers, with roughly 21,000 still without electricity, while Waymo paused service across at least seven Bay Area cities as teams coordinated with local officials to resume operations. The episode also drew attention from competitors, after Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk posted on X that his companies' robotaxi services were unaffected by the outage. For investors tracking the autonomous-vehicle race, the incident may highlight how edge-case infrastructure failures could influence operational resilience, regulatory discussions, and relative positioning among emerging robotaxi platforms.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

People familiar with the figures told the publication that OpenAI's internal compute margin, which measures revenue left after model-running costs for paying users, reached 70% as of October, up from 52% at the end of 2024 and roughly double the level seen in January 2024. An OpenAI spokesperson said the company does not disclose these figures and declined further comment, but the improvement could suggest that recent monetization efforts across corporate and consumer offerings are beginning to gain traction, even as the company remains unprofitable.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with PCG.\nIs GOOG fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAt the same time, OpenAI continues to face pressure around spending discipline and intensifying competition. After Alphabet Inc.'s Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) Gemini model performed better on certain benchmarks, Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman reportedly called a code red, redirecting internal resources toward improving ChatGPT and slowing progress on an advertising initiative. Most users still rely on ChatGPT's free tier, but OpenAI has been pushing its business-focused products and paid software features for industries such as financial services and education, where it competes directly with Google and privately held rival Anthropic.\n\nThe Information also reported that OpenAI's paid accounts generate better compute margins than Anthropic's, while Anthropic is said to operate with stronger overall server efficiency. Against that backdrop, OpenAI is in early discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and potentially use its chips, a move that could value the company at north of $500 billion. These talks, alongside the reported margin gains, suggest OpenAI is attempting to balance revenue optimization with the heavy infrastructure demands required to remain competitive at the frontier of AI development.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”\n\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs : a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1 OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X , that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing . He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product . The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API , which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’ OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information . One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nChatGPT can directly edit your code The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools , including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025 . ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.\n\nFebruary 2025 OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X , Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in.

In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required.

That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat? Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT? Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together , Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude , and developers are creating open source alternatives .\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy? OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form . This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “ OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request ”.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT? Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools , have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with .\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes .\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts? Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase . Another is ChatX . More launch every day.\nCan ChatGPT be detected? Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests , they’re inconsistent at best.\nAre ChatGPT chats public? No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT? None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT? Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\nThis story is continually updated with new information.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

So I just think it's a lack of sellers. I I'm not nearly as bullish as as you are going into January, but for now, I just think it's a lack of sellers.\n00:32 Brian\nUh why not? What gives you pause, Tom?\n00:37 Tom\nUh just price. I mean, if you're, you know, I'm I'm a pretty, I've been a pretty active trader for a long time and price is kind of everything. I don't really think about anything, you know, beyond price. and sometimes you get to the point where you're like, hey, it it just becomes a pot odds play, Brian. Where is there more risk? Is there more risk to staying long or is there a better payout being short? That's all it is.\n01:04 Brian\nIs there underneath the surface of let's say Nvidia, Tom and some of those well-known uh AI plays? Are there other areas of the market in in AI that are that are breaking down that that are red flags to you?\n01:15 Tom\nNo, not yet. I mean, I mean the the small caps, the small cap AI stocks are trailing a little bit, but not really and there's a lot of stocks in the pipeline that, you know, also look good that might come out as IPOs in 2026. But for the most part, I think it's just, it's just the mega tech, the mega tech stocks. It's it's the it's the big, too big to fail companies. And I think in that sense, that's where the real risk is.\n01:33 Brian\nBrooke, I mentioned here at the top that uh AI is back in rally mode. I call out Nvidia, Microsoft, but if if you dig down a little deeper, it's not every one of these stocks have been rocking the past five or even 10 trading sessions.\n01:46 Brooke\nYeah, if you take a look, there are some companies that are definitely pulling back some momentum. For example, we do have Oracle moving higher today, up about 1.2%, but if you take a look over the month, it's down about 2%. Over the past six months, down about 5% as we make our way into year end. And also, in addition to that, to take a look at some of the players that did go public this year. Take for example, we have uh another one like Core Weave moving higher today up about 3.5%. On the flip side, that stock up nearly 20% year uh or rather in the past month alone as we make our way into the end of the year. I think that investors are really trying to see how exactly they could still get into this this tech rally, still find those spots that maybe have been underperformers as of late in fear that they might miss out. I think we're seeing a bit of FOMO as we make our way into the later days and the last few days of this year's trading session.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The findings come from the 2025 RankOS™ AI Visibility Benchmark , a national analysis conducted using RankOS™, the company’s proprietary operating system for brand visibility across AI-powered and traditional search platforms.\n\nDeveloped and refined over several years through active client deployment across more than 500 brands spanning D2C ecommerce, retail, B2B and SaaS, RankOS™ was built to measure how brands are represented, cited, and evaluated by AI systems as search behavior shifts from results pages to direct answers.\n____\nKey Findings from the 2025 RankOS™ AI Visibility Benchmark\nThe benchmark analyzed thousands of branded, non-branded, and category-level queries across multiple AI-powered search platforms and traditional search environments. Key findings include:\n87% of businesses do not appear in AI-generated search answers\nDespite strong traditional SEO performance, the vast majority of brands lack the authority and citation signals required for AI inclusion.\nOnly 13% of businesses were cited by AI systems at least once\nAI engines showed a strong preference for a small subset of highly verifiable brands.\nBrands with third-party media citations were 4× more likely to be referenced by AI\nAI systems disproportionately favored brands supported by authoritative external sources.\nLess than 20% of mid-market companies had complete, AI-readable structured data\nMissing or inconsistent schema was one of the most common barriers to AI visibility.\nEntity ambiguity remains a leading exclusion factor\nAI systems frequently failed to distinguish between similarly named brands without clear entity validation.\nAI visibility correlates with downstream business impact\nBrands appearing in AI answers showed higher branded search volume, increased inbound inquiries, and stronger trust signals.\n\nStory Continues\n____\nWhy AI Visibility Differs from Traditional SEO\nTraditional SEO is primarily optimized for ranking web pages. AI-powered search systems, by contrast, evaluate brands as entities , relying on signals such as:\nConsistent entity representation across the web\nVerified third-party citations and references\nStructured data that clearly defines brand identity\nTrust signals derived from authoritative sources\n\nRankOS™ was designed to measure these factors continuously and translate them into actionable insights.\n____\nThe Role of RankOS™\nRankOS™ functions as both a measurement platform and operating methodology , allowing NEWMEDIA.COM to assess how brands are interpreted by AI systems and to identify the specific signals preventing inclusion in AI-generated answers.\nThe platform evaluates:\nEntity Authority: how clearly and consistently a brand is defined\nCitation Strength: quality and volume of verifiable mentions\nVisibility Signals: structured data, profiles, and schema completeness\nAI Answer Share: frequency of brand inclusion across AI responses\nBy consolidating these metrics, RankOS™ provides businesses with a practical framework for AI Engine Optimization (AEO) .\n____\nA Market-Wide Shift\nAs AI platforms increasingly serve as the first point of discovery for consumers and B2B buyers, the benchmark suggests that AI visibility is emerging as a new competitive differentiator.\nNEWMEDIA.COM plans to release additional industry-specific and geographic benchmarks through the remainder of 2025 and throughout 2026.\n____\nAbout NEWMEDIA.COM\nFounded in 1996 , NEWMEDIA.COM is a nationally recognized digital agency specializing in strategy, design, development, and performance-driven marketing for growth-focused brands.

      "Content": "PANW Deepens Ties With Google: Will This Enhance Prisma AIRS Adoption?\n\nOm Jaiswal\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:43 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: PANW\n\nGOOG\n\nPalo Alto Networks PANW is strengthening its partnership with Google Cloud to support secure artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud adoption. This expanded partnership places Prisma AI Runtime Security (AIRS), Palo Alto Networks’ AI security platform, directly inside Google Cloud’s AI and developer services. The aim is to secure AI workloads from development through production.\n\nPalo Alto Networks recently announced that it is expanding its partnership with Google Cloud. Under the expanded partnership agreement, Palo Alto Networks’ Prisma AIRS will be integrated with Google Cloud services, such as Vertex AI and Agent Engine. This will allow customers to secure AI models, data, and agents while they are running on Google Cloud. The partnership also includes deeper use of Palo Alto Networks’ software firewalls and Secured Access Service Edge products on Google Cloud. This helps customers apply the same security policies across cloud, AI, and network environments.\nPrisma AIRS checks prompts, responses, and agent actions in real time. This helps reduce risks, such as prompt injection, data leakage, and misuse of tools. Because security is built directly into these platforms, customers do not need to deploy separate security products to protect AI agents. Apart from Google Cloud, PANW has integrated Prisma AIRS with several other AI agent platforms, including Factory, Glean, IBM, and ServiceNow. These integrations secure AI agents inside tools that customers already use.\n\nThe above-mentioned factors highlight the growing adoption of Prisma AIRS. Furthermore, the number of Prisma AIRS deals more than doubled on a sequential basis during the first quarter of fiscal 2026, highlighting Prisma AIRS’ rising usage.\nWith rising AI adoption and as customers shift toward more integrated platforms, Prisma AIRS’ surging usage could support PANW's future growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 and 2027 indicates revenue growth of around 14.1% and 13.3%, respectively.\nHow Competitors Fare Against PANW CrowdStrike CRWD and Okta Inc. OKTA are key players competing with CrowdStrike, which are focusing on partnerships and acquisitions for platform expansion and AI innovation.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2026, CrowdStrike expanded its partnership with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). CrowdStrike’s Falcon Next-Generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is now available directly inside AWS Security Hub. This means AWS customers can start using Falcon SIEM more easily, without extra setup. The management believes that this creates a larger pool of potential users and gives CrowdStrike more chances to turn usage into paid subscriptions, often through the Falcon Flex model.\n\nStory Continues\nOkta completed its acquisition of Axiom Security in September 2025. Through this acquisition, Okta has added new tools for privileged access management, helping customers control who can reach sensitive cloud, SaaS and database systems.\nPANW’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Palo Alto Networks have lost 10.2% in the past three months compared with the Zacks Security industry’s decline of 8.4%.\nPANW 3-month Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Palo Alto Networks trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 11.77X compared with the industry’s average of 11.79X.\nPANW Forward 12-Month P/S Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Palo Alto Networks’ fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 14.7% and 12.5%, respectively. Estimates for fiscal 2026 have been revised upward by 4 cents over the past 30 days, while the estimates for fiscal 2027 have been revised downward by a penny over the past seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPalo Alto Networks currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) autonomous driving operation, is widely considered the leader in the advance of self-driving car technology. Many believe its product is ahead of those of Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ), GM, and Ford. Waymo-powered cars have logged over 100 million “fully autonomous miles.” It now operates, or will soon, in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, Miami, District of Columbia, and Dallas. It also has limited tests in Tokyo.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points An incident during the recent blackout in San Francisco has harmed Waymo’s image as the self-driving leader.\nElon Musk took the opportunity to boast about Tesla’s self-driving technology.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAn incident during the recent blackout in San Francisco shattered Waymo’s image. According to The New York Times, “Waymo Suspended Service in San Francisco After Its Cars Stalled During Power Outage.” The vehicles stopped when traffic lights went out. Fortunately, that resulted in no injuries.\nTesla is betting heavily on its own self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk posted on X, “SAN FRAN BLACKOUT – WAYMO FROZE, TESLA DROVE Waymo’s robotaxis got a little too real last night - by completely shutting down when San Francisco’s power outage knocked out traffic lights.”\nTesla claims it will be the leader in the sector, despite skeptics whose opinions have largely been fueled by Waymo’s success. Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving (FSD)” is already in a number of its vehicles. However, to use it, drivers must keep their eyes on the road. Tesla’s first test of its self-driving robotaxi started in Austin early this year. Tesla plans to move into San Francisco, then to begin testing in Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and Miami.\n\nIt is an open question whether the Waymo problem is part of a temporary defect in its product. Yet, it would be hard to find an incident that would hurt it more or help Tesla’s chances, at least in the court of public opinion and among some experts.\nMusk has repeatedly bragged that no one can match his autonomous vehicle technology. Waymo had undermined that claim. According to CNBC, “Alphabet-owned Waymo kept expanding and dominated the robotaxi market in the U.S., though rivals Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox also launched the first versions of their services in 2025.”\nMusk’s comments about its self-driving future have been part of the rise in its share price since April. Waymo has given investors another reason to buy Tesla shares.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said Uber expects to offer driverless rides in more than 10 markets by the end of next year, building on existing operations in Abu Dhabi.\nUber is betting that partnerships, not ownership, are the fastest way to scale autonomy. Investors will be watching how quickly these pilots turn into everyday rides.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d592d469-85e3-3073-905a-c722711dd83f/only-seen-twice-in-153-years%3A.html",
      "Content": "Only Seen Twice in 153 Years: History’s Clear Warning for the Stock Market in 2026\n\nDavid Beren\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIt should go without saying that the S&P 500 has been riding high over the last few years and has delivered one of the most impressive runs in market history. Over the past three years, the index has surged a whopping 80%, driven in part by artificial intelligence, falling interest rates, and ongoing corporate earnings growth. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolio balances have reached levels that might have seemed all but impossible to achieve a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 surged 80% over three years. This has occurred only twice before in 153 years.\nPrevious instances (1920s and 1990s) both preceded market crashes of 49% to 89%.\nThe S&P 500 forward P/E sits around 21 to 22. This is roughly 40% above historical averages.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnfortunately, any exceptional performance like this in the market comes with something of a warning label. A three-year gain of this kind of magnitude with the S&P 500 has only occurred twice in the last 153 years of stock market performance. The first, the 1920s bull market, and the late 1990s tech boom both ended in devastating fashion with the Great Depression and the dot-com bust.\nThankfully, history doesn't always guarantee repetition, but it does signal that a pattern could be forming in the sense that markets performing this well for this long could be a giant warning sign for investors. As 2026 gets closer, understanding what happened in the last two instances now just feels like understanding basic risk management.\nThe S&P 500's Ultra-Rare 3-Year Surge: What History Predicts If you look closely, the 80% gain over the last three years roughly translates to anywhere between a 21% and 27% annualized return, which is more than double the S&P 500's long-term average of approximately 10% in gains. The rarity of this occurrence cannot be overstated, considering it has only happened twice in the 153 years, with the 1927-1929 bull market rising 95% and the tech boom between 1995 and 1998 increased 85%.\n\nIf you're seeing giant warning signs today, it's because you know that what is taking place in the market today, performance-wise, is eerily familiar to what has happened before. In the 1920s, you had a market that boomed because of cars becoming more readily available, on top of electrification taking place across cities and non-cities alike. It was the promise of a new era, and the 1990s boom was driven by something similar, as the internet was being heralded as something that was going to transform everything we knew about technology, communication, and just about everything in between.\n\nStory Continues\nThe 80% surge between 2023 and 2025 is following the same pattern, and this is what is causing warning bells to go off. Unsurprisingly, AI is being heralded as the transforming technology, and valuations have expanded significantly as a result. This all feels very much like 1999, and AI is being labeled as the kind of technology that will change everything, just as the internet was heralded as something transforming, and electricity absolutely did transform everything. This all comes together with a clear message in that when the stock market delivers this kind of three-year performance, it precedes major reversals.\n\nAnalyzing the Historical Precedents for 2026 During the 1927 to 1929 surge, the market continued to climb well into September before it all came crashing down in October. The initial 48% decline happened between October and November, but the real impact was felt from the end of 1929 all the way toward the end of 1932, when the total market collapse took place, dropping the market by around 89% in total. Crazily enough, it would take 25 years before the market would return to its 1929 highs.\n\nFast forward to the 1995-1998 surge, the market continued to climb higher and higher through 1999 before it peaked in March 2020. The rest, as they say, is well-known history, as the dot com crash erased 49% of the S&P 500's value in just 2.5 years. The Nasdaq fell 78% and its overall recovery would take another seven years before returning to its starting levels.\nThe takeaway here is that there is a consistent pattern that was followed in both of these cases, in that the market didn't crash immediately after a three-year surge. The market rally actually, and surprisingly, as you look back, continued for an extra year, delivering even more gains before a severe decline. In 2026, the cautionary tale is that history suggests either the market delivers this year as one full of gains or one that shows indicators of a reversal. Suffice it to say, neither scenario paints a pretty picture, as even if investors get one more year of gains, the crash starts and wipes all the gains out.\n\nIs an AI Bubble Forming? The Biggest Risk Heading into 2026 If you have been watching the current level of AI enthusiasm, and who hasn't been, the parallels between today and previous tech bubbles are almost impossible to ignore. We are already seeing just how transformative AI can be, something that echoes what the country saw during the electrification of the 1920s and the internet in the 1990s. Sadly, real technology, no matter how transformative, doesn't always prevent bubbles. If anything, it actually enables a bubble to take place by trying to justify massive corporate valuations.\n\nThe biggest takeaway right now is that the signs of a bubble transformation are present, and they are present across multiple indicators. Valuations for AI-centric stocks are assuming nearly flawless execution and sustained growth continuing for years into the future. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) are all investing billions, tens of billions into AI infrastructure without a clear signal of what the return could be. As a result, the S&P 500's forward P/E is sitting around 21 to 22, approximately 40% above historical averages.\nIf you are a retail investor, and many of us are, this is something to be very aware of, as is options trading, which has seen its volume surge in AI stocks. Reddit, in particular, has come alive with discussion, especially on places like r/WallStreetBets, in a way that feels almost too familiar if you were on message boards during the dot-com era in 1999. On top of social media conversation, you also have companies adding \"AI\" anywhere they can in their core descriptions or even their company names to try and boost valuations. This closely mirrors when companies added \".com\" to their company names in the late 1990s to try to jump on a similar trend.\n\nThe bottom line is that any catalyst for a stock reversal could come from slower-than-anticipated AI adoption or even disappointing returns from AI investments. Add to all of these concerns over an economic slowdown resulting from tariffs, or even inflationary concerns, depending on how the Fed handles interest rates. This all comes together in what could be a perfect storm for either a massive buying shift or a major selling rally, and any instance of the latter is going to feed on itself as panic selling grabs hold until the bottom falls out.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is a Buy at Citizens on Waymo Operational Progress as RBC Capital Downplays Real Estate Prospects\n\nNeha Gupta\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:39 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is one of the best forever stocks to buy according to hedge funds . On December 17, analysts at Citizens reiterated that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a Market Outperform with a $340 price target. The positive stance is in response to Waymo’s third-quarter operational update.\nThe autonomous driving subsidiary says its cumulative rider miles increased by 28 million in the third quarter, representing 24% quarter-over-quarter growth. Phoenix has emerged as the subsidiary’s biggest market, where the unit added 10 million rider-only miles. The milestone comes as the unit plans to raise more than $15 billion at a valuation of about $100 billion.\n\nThe valuation underscores Waymo’s emergence as a leader in driverless technology as the company continues to ramp up its fleet. Backed by Alphabet, Waymo remains in a solid position to take on Tesla and others in the autonomous ride-hailing business. It is currently the only company without a safety driver across multiple cities.\nMeanwhile, RBC Capital does not expect Alphabet to enter the real estate portal market. According to the research firm, the company faces significant barriers to entry, key among them being the MLS participation requirement. For starters, IDX feeds are designed for agents, not horizontal marketing platforms, which makes MLS approval problematic. To participate Google will have to become a broker in hundreds of MLS organizations.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a multinational tech conglomerate and holding company, best known as the parent of Google, managing core internet services (Search, Ads, YouTube, Android, Maps) under Google. It also boasts of other ventures like cloud computing (Google Cloud), hardware (Pixel, Nest), and “Other Bets” in areas like self-driving cars (Waymo) and life sciences (Calico).\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be the World's Largest Company by Year-End 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:21 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet has a comprehensive AI stack, owning nearly every component of the AI ecosystem.\nIts impressive growth has a long runway to continue as AI adoption spreads.\nThe stock's very reasonable valuation leaves plenty of room to overtake Nvidia's valuation in time.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) investment cycle, where companies are investing billions of dollars in data centers and other infrastructure, has propelled AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to its position as the world's largest company by market capitalization .\nIt's a remarkable feat, and it took the stock price rising nearly 1,000% in just three years to accomplish it. But it's difficult to stay atop the mountain, and a formidable challenger is looming. Initially, investors thought artificial intelligence would threaten tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nHowever, Google's parent company has seized the opportunity and become arguably the most complete AI stock on the market today.\nSo, this Fool is calling it now: Alphabet, not Nvidia, will be the world's largest company in 2026. I state my case below.\nEnvious competitive positioning as the full-stack AI player The AI landscape is still in its early chapters. A lot will happen over the next decade or two, so it's not easy to make many predictions with much confidence. That said, Alphabet could have the strongest argument for a leading role in AI's future.\nIt wouldn't be a stretch to call Alphabet the world's most prominent internet company. It's known for its dominant Google search engine, but in reality, Alphabet's empire casts a far longer shadow. Its chief assets include:\n\nYouTube, the largest streaming platform.\nGoogle Chrome, a leading web browser.\nAndroid, a leading smartphone operating software.\nGoogle Workspace, a collection of internet apps with over 3 billion users.\nThese assets provide Alphabet with key insights and data on most of the world's web users, a crucial resource for developing and training its AI models. Additionally, Alphabet's Google Cloud is the world's third-largest cloud computing services platform, and the company has created custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), for its data centers.\nIn other words, Alphabet owns a comprehensive AI ecosystem that gives it a significant competitive advantage over most other AI companies, which typically own only pieces of an ecosystem.\n\nPlenty of growth still to come Some AI hyperscalers have had to take on substantial debt to fund their data center investments. Not Alphabet, which has primarily funded its investments with profits thanks to its various established businesses that generate cash flow like few companies on the planet can.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Alphabet's core businesses continue to thrive. Revenue from digital advertising through Google and YouTube grew by roughly 15% year over year in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Google Cloud revenue increased by 34% as AI usage drives cloud demand.\nAssuming AI adoption continues to spread throughout society, especially among consumers using AI apps, that growth doesn't seem likely to slow down anytime soon. That's before considering Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary, which continues to expand into new markets and is now seeking funding to accelerate its growth efforts.\n\nAll in all, Wall Street analysts estimate Alphabet will grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 16% over the next three to five years.\nThe stock's valuation is reasonable and has room to run Nvidia certainly has strong growth prospects as well, but some of its customers, such as OpenAI and Oracle , are facing scrutiny for how they will fund their massive AI commitments. In other words, it appears that Nvidia's growth is more fragile because it relies on a small number of customers. For Alphabet, AI adds additional upside to its established cloud and digital ads businesses.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's market cap of $4.3 trillion is just 16% higher than Alphabet's. Alphabet currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, using full-year earnings estimates, a reasonable price tag for high-teens annualized earnings growth, especially for a world-class company with multiple highly profitable businesses.\nThat leaves room for the stock to continue higher through 2026 if Alphabet's businesses continue to perform well. If confidence in Nvidia's growth dips, I could see Alphabet overtaking it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

( NYSE:UBER ) and Lyft Inc. ( NASDAQ:LYFT ) are pushing further into autonomous mobility by separately partnering with Baidu Inc. ( NASDAQ:BIDU ) to trial driverless taxis in the UK, as ride-hailing platforms look to position themselves for the next phase of urban transport. Uber said Monday that a pilot using Baidu's Apollo Go RT6 robotaxis is set to begin in London in the first half of 2026, with commercial services in the city expected before the end of next year. In parallel, Lyft Chief Executive Officer David Risher said in a post on X that Lyft plans to test dozens of the same vehicles in the UK next year, pending regulatory approval.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with UBER.\nIs UBER fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThese initiatives come as robotaxi rollouts continue to expand globally, led by Chinese companies such as Baidu and Weride Inc., alongside Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo. Uber and Weride have already launched driverless operations in Abu Dhabi and are planning additional expansion across the Middle East, while Baidu is running autonomous trials in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Switzerland. Waymo also began testing in London this month, highlighting how autonomous driving developers are increasingly operating across borders as they seek regulatory pathways and commercial scale.\nUber exited internal autonomous driving development in 2020 and has since focused on partnerships with specialized robotaxi operators. Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a Bloomberg Television interview this month that Uber plans to offer driverless services in more than 10 markets by the end of next year. Lyft appears to be following a similar approach and has already signed an agreement with Baidu to roll out robotaxis in Europe, while Grab is partnering with Weride and Momenta in Southeast Asia. Even so, the long-term profitability of the robotaxi model remains uncertain, with listed autonomous vehicle companies such as Pony AI Inc. ( NASDAQ:PONY ) and Weride still reporting losses after raising funds through share sales.\n\nCondiciones y Política de privacidad\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Alphabet Inc\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $270.81. It's currently trading at a price of $307.16. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -13.42%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$8.67\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 24.30% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n170.15\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n191.11\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n270.81\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $187.72. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -63.63%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What Is One of the Best AI Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2026 and Beyond?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's core business is thriving.\nIt may consider selling its custom chips to outside clients.\nThe company has emerged as a leader in generative AI.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIdentifying which artificial intelligence (AI) stock has the most potential in 2026 and beyond is no simple task. If your time frame after 2026 is only a few years, then an AI infrastructure company like Nvidia may be the best option. If your time frame runs for a decade after 2026, you may be better off with a software company like Palantir .\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a combination of these two options, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is one of the best AI stocks to buy and hold.\nAlphabet has had a stellar year, rising around 60% so far in 2025. I don't expect that performance to repeat in 2026, but I still think it has market-beating potential.\nIts core business is thriving Alphabet's primary business is the Google Search engine. At the start of 2025, a large majority of investors assumed that generative AI technologies would replace Google. However, Alphabet saw the writing on the wall and made swift changes.\nThe biggest innovation was the integration of AI-powered Overviews in Google Search. These provide nearly every search result with a generative-AI summary at the top of the page, giving the user a hybrid experience.\n\nFor many, these will be the most AI capabilities that they need. For others, Google's generative AI model, Gemini, has emerged as a top option in the space.\nIn one year, Gemini has risen from the laughingstock of the AI world to one of the best. Its improvements were so impressive that they forced OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, to declare a \"code red\" at the company. That's a long way from where Gemini was viewed entering 2025, and the change in fortunes for both the Google Search business and the progress of Alphabet's generative AI model can be thanked for its stock performance.\nAnother area that boosted Alphabet's stock was the performance of its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which is building out excess computing capacity to rent to those who cannot build their own data centers. Within Google Cloud, Alphabet provides access to its custom tensor processing units (TPUs), which can outperform graphics processing units (GPUs) when the workload is properly configured.\nThese computing units have been Alphabet's secret weapons in training its cutting-edge generative AI models, and locking access to them behind one of its other business units is genius. However, management may be exploring alternative territory.\n\nStory Continues\nReportedly, the company is considering selling its TPUs to Meta Platforms outright instead of requiring it to rent access to them via Google Cloud. That's a step in a different direction and could result in a new revenue stream that investors haven't accounted for. The AI computing market is huge, and if Alphabet can secure a sliver, it could provide serious growth.\n\nTime will tell if this business venture pans out, but Alphabet is doing incredibly well as a company. It's also spending responsibly, which is something that not every company can say.\nAlphabet has plenty of cash to fund its build-outs One of the growing concerns in the AI realm is a potential bubble forming around building AI computing capacity. There are questions about how AI hyperscalers will fund it, which is a perfectly acceptable question to ask of a company like OpenAI. However, Alphabet has plenty of cash flow to continue building data centers as it pleases.\n\nThe two metrics that inventors in this realm should familiarize themselves with are operating cash flow and free cash flow. Operating cash flow is all of the cash that a business produces, which can be used to fund capital expenditures (capex). Free cash flow subtracts capex, which shows the remaining cash a business has to repurchase shares, pay down debt, or fund dividends.\nAlphabet has plenty of cash to continue spending on AI data centers if it chooses, which is a great position to be in. While it is spending a lot of its cash on build-outs, it has plenty left before it risks dropping into negative figures. That's a huge advantage the company has over nearly any other competitor in the AI race, and it's the primary reason I think Alphabet is one of the best AI stocks to buy in 2026 and hold for several years after.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "A $6 billion nuclear deal has Trump’s name all over it. It’s raising serious ethics concerns\n\nMatt Egan, CNN\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: WSFX.BO\n\nTATE.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nThe Trump business empire’s expansion into nuclear fusion is alarming ethics experts, who warn it poses glaring conflicts of interest and risks the federal government playing favorites in what could be the holy grail of clean energy.\nTrump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ) shocked Wall Street last week by arranging a $6 billion marriage with TAE Technologies , a Google-backed company at the leading edge of fusion energy.\n\nThe merger means that soon, President Donald Trump will simultaneously have a major financial interest in a company whose fortunes will be influenced by the actions of a government that Trump himself presides over.\nNuclear fusion companies are regulated by the federal government and will likely need Uncle Sam’s deep research and even deeper pockets to become commercially viable. The merger needs to be approved by federal regulators – some of whom were nominated by Trump.\n“There is a clear conflict of interest here,” Richard Painter, the top ethics official under former President George W. Bush, told CNN in a phone interview. “Every other president since the Civil War has divested from business interests that would conflict with official duties. President Trump has done the opposite.”\n\nPainter, who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said anyone other than the president or the vice president could be committing a crime if they participated in a US government matter that they knew they had a financial interest in.\nFor instance, he said the secretary of energy would have to recuse him or herself from any matter linked to fusion if they simultaneously had a significant stake in a fusion company.\n“It’s only legal because the criminal conflict of interest statute does not apply to the president,” Painter said, adding that while it is “technically legal” he doesn’t believe presidents should be excluded from the law.\nAn instant $500 million boost to Trump’s fortune The fusion deal caused an immediate boost to Trump’s net worth.\nTrump Media’s share price skyrocketed 42% when the merger was announced on Thursday. That increased the value of the stake Trump owns through a trust, by $500 million to $1.7 billion. Trump Media’s share price continued to climb Friday, increasing the value of that stake to above $1.8 billion.\nSome on Wall Street are betting the deal will create a halo effect for TAE.\nTAE will “clearly have major political support from President Trump in our view and this importantly will create a major nuclear fusion US energy domestic bet over the coming years,” Dan Ives, a veteran tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, told clients in a note last week.\n\nStory Continues\nHarnessing the power of the stars Fusion is a futuristic form of energy that aims to replicate the same process that powers the sun and other stars. It has long been viewed as a potential game-changer because it would provide almost limitless clean energy.\nHowever, fusion is not yet commercially viable, and to get it off the ground it may need support from the federal government in the form of loans, subsidies, contracts and research.\n\nThat’s why the public interest could be harmed if the merger creates an unfair advantage for Trump-backed TAE, worries Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who studies government ethics.\n“The risk is that one company will end up being a government favorite, not because of objective scientistic evaluation, but because they paid off the president,” Clark said. “It reminds me of the Soviet Union appointing scientists based on their claimed ideology, not their actual achievement.”\n‘Bad for humanity’ Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who co-chairs the House Fusion Energy Caucus, told CNN in a phone interview that he was “stunned” by the Trump Media deal.\n“I hate the thought of a president who puts his name on the Kennedy Center putting his foot on the scale of who the winners and losers are in fusion energy,” Beyer said.\n\nBeyer said he has been “encouraged” by the Energy Department’s support for fusion energy and is pleased to have a president supportive of the industry.\nThe Trump administration in October released a Fusion Science and Technology Roadmap that “aims to usher a burgeoning fusion private sector industry in the US toward maturity on the most rapid timeline.”\nBut Beyer noted there are more than two dozen fusion companies operating in the United States, some of which are further along in development than TAE.\n“If the Trump engagement means the whole industry proceeds more quickly, that’s a win for humanity,” Beyer said. “But if it means everyone else is going to be disadvantaged and the government’s largesse will focus on one company, that is bad for humanity and bad for America.”\n\nFusion CEO: Not looking for ‘special’ treatment The White House rejected concerns about a conflict of interest.\n“The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read. Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement to CNN.\nNeither the Energy Department nor the Trump Organization responded to requests for comment.\nMichl Binderbauer, the CEO of TAE, told CNN that he decided to merge with Trump Media because it offered the “last piece of the puzzle” in their quest to build a power plant: capital.\n“Sometimes you get lucky and you meet the right people,” he said.\n\nBinderbauer said he isn’t concerned that any government support his company needs or receives will become politically controversial because he’s joined forces with Trump.\n“I’m not looking for anything special,” he said.\nDonald J. Trump Revocable Trust After winning the election last fall, Trump transferred his dominant stake in Trump Media to the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust.\nTrump is the sole beneficiary of that trust, which is controlled by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who also plans to sit on the combined company’s board of directors .\nClark said the transfer to a trust is irrelevant when it comes to a conflict of interest.\n\n“It’s utterly meaningless. As a matter of ethics, it’s BS,” she said.\nPainter, the former Bush ethics official, agrees the transfer to a trust doesn’t matter because Trump still has a financial interest.\n“That’s like saying, ‘I don’t own a piece of property just because I hired a property manager to take care of it,’” Painter said.\nPainter said there is a simple way for Trump to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n“He should divest. Divest from nuclear fusion, social media and cryptocurrency,” Painter said.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "$7.7 Billion of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Is Invested in 2 Quantum Computing Stocks\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Buffett owns two quantum computing stocks -- Alphabet and Amazon.\nBoth companies focus on much more than just quantum computing, of course.\nAlphabet and Amazon are good picks for other investors, too.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nNobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Richard Feynman once stated, \"No one understands quantum mechanics.\" I mention Feynman's quote because many investors are excited about quantum computing stocks these days – and quantum computing is based on the principles of (you probably guessed it) quantum mechanics.\n\nThat leads me to another quote, in this case a statement made by Warren Buffett: \"Never invest in a business you cannot understand.\" Buffett has also written about only investing in companies within your \"circle of competence.\"\nWith all of this in mind, you might think that Buffett wouldn't touch a quantum computing stock with a 10-foot pole. However, $7.7 billion of his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio is invested in two quantum computing stocks.\nBuffett's two quantum computing stocks Has Buffett quietly bought shares of D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) , IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) , or Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) ? Nope. I doubt that he'd give any of these up-and-coming quantum computing stocks a second of his attention. However, the legendary investor has acquired shares in two other companies that are investing heavily in quantum computing.\n\nIn 2019, Berkshire initiated a new position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . Buffett later acknowledged that one of the conglomerate's two investment managers decided to buy Amazon. But Buffett also admitted that he had been \"an idiot\" for not investing in the company earlier.\nAmazon is a bigger player in quantum computing than you might think. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers Amazon Braket, a cloud service that allows researchers to test quantum computing algorithms, test quantum hardware, and develop quantum software. Amazon also introduced its Ocelot quantum computing chip earlier this year. Ocelet supports quantum error reduction by up to 90%.\nBuffett has also expressed regret for not investing in Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , earlier. He corrected that mistake in 2025. Berkshire bought over 17.8 million shares of the tech giant.\n\nAlphabet's Google Quantum AI is another pioneer in the field of quantum computing. In 2019, the unit developed a quantum system that performed a calculation in 200 seconds that it said \"would have taken the best-known algorithms in the most powerful supercomputers at the time 10,000 years to accomplish.\" Google Quantum AI also demonstrated the first logical qubit prototype in 2023.\n\nStory Continues\nMore than quantum computing Today, Berkshire's stakes in these two quantum computing stocks amount to around $7.7 billion. However, Buffett and his team didn't buy shares of Amazon or Alphabet because of their quantum computing initiatives. I doubt that the companies' quantum computing efforts even factored into the investing decisions at all.\n\nAmazon's dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing was a significant attraction for Berkshire when it first invested in the company in 2019. Over six years later, Amazon remains the No. 1 player in both markets.\nAlphabet is, at its heart, an advertising company. Ads on Google Search, YouTube, the Google Network, and other apps generate roughly 72% of Alphabet's total revenue. While Buffett may not fully understand quantum computing and other advanced technologies, he certainly has a firm grasp of advertising.\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet offer more than their core businesses, though. For example, Amazon is preparing to launch a satellite internet service. Google Cloud is a key growth driver for Alphabet. Also, the company's famous \"other bets\" include self-driving car leader Waymo and high-speed internet provider GFiber.\n\nAre Alphabet and Amazon good stocks to buy? Don't buy Alphabet and Amazon just because Buffett owns the stocks. However, I think both are good picks for many investors.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) presents a massive tailwind for AWS and Google Cloud. Amazon and Google should especially profit as the adoption of agentic AI grows. Both giants have significant opportunities in the robotaxi market.\n\nBuffett's two quantum computing stocks are more than just investments in quantum computing.

This has prompted fresh questions about valuation.\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet.\nThe backdrop is a strong year of execution in search, YouTube, and especially cloud, and the latest 1 day share price gain of 1.55% suggests momentum is still building after a powerful multi year total shareholder return.\n\nIf Alphabet’s move has you thinking more broadly about tech, now could be a good time to explore high growth tech and AI stocks for other potential growth stories.\nWith revenue and profits still growing double digits and the stock trading just below average analyst targets, investors face a key question: Is Alphabet still undervalued, or is the market already pricing in its next leg of growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 9.7% Undervalued According to oscargarcia, the narrative fair value of $340 sits above Alphabet’s last close at $307.16, framing the stock as modestly mispriced.\nGoogle’s balance sheet is like a bunker built with gold bricks.

According to an estimate by McKinsey, companies need to invest a staggering $5.2 trillion by 2030 on data centers equipped to handle AI processing loads.\n\nHowever, technology is only part of the story. Power is quietly becoming a major factor in driving the AI revolution because AI data centers consume an enormous amount of electricity. As a result, leading energy infrastructure companies such as NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) are emerging as leaders in powering the AI revolution.\nPartnering with AI leaders NextEra Energy owns the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light) and one of the largest energy infrastructure development companies (NextEra Energy Resources). The energy resources segment owns and develops energy infrastructure, including electricity transmission lines and power generation facilities, to support third-party demand.\n\nThe company has become a key partner of choice for technology companies to help power their AI strategies over the past year. In October, NextEra Energy signed a new collaboration with Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to accelerate nuclear energy deployment in the U.S. As part of the partnership, NextEra Energy will restart its dormant Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa to support Google's growing power needs. The tech titan has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to purchase the bulk of the power produced by the facility upon its return to commercial service in the first quarter of 2029.\nNextEra and Google also announced a significant expansion of their energy and technology collaboration in December. They will partner on developing multiple gigawatt (GW)-scale data center campuses in the future with accompanying generation and capacity. NextEra will supply the energy expertise, while Google will bring its data center development capabilities to the partnership.\nNextEra Energy is also working with Meta Platforms to help power its AI operations. Meta Platforms recently signed 11 PPAs and two energy storage agreements. NextEra will develop several solar energy projects for Meta, totaling 2.5 GW of power-producing capacity.\n\nStory Continues\nMassive power deals Brookfield Renewable is a leading global renewable energy producer . It sells the power it produces to utilities and large corporations under long-term PPAs.\nEarlier this year, Brookfield announced a first-of-its-kind Hydro Framework Agreement with Google. The cloud giant will purchase up to 3 GW of carbon-free hydroelectric power from the company in the future, marking the largest-ever hydropower deal. The first two 20-year PPAs represent over $3 billion of power and cover Brookfield's Holtwood and Safe Harbor hydroelectric facilities in Pennsylvania, which have a combined generating capacity of 670 megawatts.\n\nBrookfield also signed a first-of-its-kind global renewable energy framework with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) last year. The five-year agreement will see Brookfield develop over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity for the technology giant in the 2026 through 2030 time frame across the U.S. and Europe. It's eight times bigger than the largest single corporate PPA ever signed. The deal will provide Microsoft with a pipeline of renewable energy capacity to support growing demand for its cloud and AI services. The companies have the potential to expand their collaboration to Asia-Pacific, India, and Latin America in the future, as well as to new or impactful carbon-free energy sources beyond wind and solar.\nAdditionally, Brookfield Renewable has an investment in Westinghouse Electric, a nuclear technology company . The U.S. Government recently signed a strategic partnership with Westinghouse to build at least $80 billion of new nuclear reactors in the country using the company's technology. These plants will help support the country's growing AI power needs.\n\nThe power behind the AI revolution NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable are two of the world's largest clean power producers. They have the electricity production capacity and development capabilities to meet the growing power needs of AI. That's leading tech titans Google, Meta, Microsoft, and others to join forces with these energy companies to help fuel the AI revolution. These deals will provide technology companies with the energy they need, while potentially powering robust total returns for investors in NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable in the coming years.\n\nShould you buy stock in NextEra Energy right now?

However, after a recent pullback, shares briefly moved below $300 and are still close to that level as of Dec. 19.\nMany investors may be wondering if they should buy shares now or wait to see if Alphabet falls further, considering the recent dip in the tech sector. Personally, I wouldn't wait. Here's why.\nThe benefit of investing in great companies It's hard to find many tech companies as dominant as Alphabet. The holding company is most famous for owning Google, the world's largest search engine, but it also owns the most popular web browser (Chrome), video streaming site (YouTube), and mobile operating system (Android). Among the other businesses that Alphabet owns are Waymo, a self-driving car company, and Wing, a drone delivery service.\n\nAlphabet generated $73.6 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over its past four reported quarters. And even with all of its successes, it remains a more affordable investment than many of the other megacap tech stocks. Trading at 29 times trailing earnings as of Dec. 17, it's the second-cheapest company among the \"Magnificent Seven\" (which also include Apple , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia , and Tesla ).\nAlphabet has historically outperformed the stock market. Based on the strength of its businesses, it looks likely to keep doing so.\nThis isn't your last chance to buy Alphabet, and truthfully, its share price could go up or down in the short term. The current price might not be the very lowest it will go in the near future. But when you're investing in great companies, you don't need to worry about timing the market. What's important is filling your portfolio with long-term winners -- not whether you bought their shares at $295, $305, or somewhere in that area.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Alphabet vs. Amazon: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:52 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet was able to change investor perception in 2025, leading to huge gains in the stock.\nAmazon has the same opportunity to do that in 2026.\nBoth stocks trade at attractive valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nTwo of the big three cloud computing companies are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . While both Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) have seen solid growth, Alphabet's stock far outpaced Amazon's in 2025, climbing nearly 60% as of this writing, versus a modest gain for Amazon.\nLet's look at which stock is set to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Alphabet Alphabet has been one of the best-performing mega-cap tech stocks in 2025, largely because it was able to flip the script from being viewed as an AI loser to perhaps having the potential to be one of the biggest AI winners. While the company turned in some strong numbers, its performance was much more about changing perceptions.\n\nIt did this largely through the advancements with its Gemini foundational large language model (LLM) and custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Gemini has become one of the best LLMs in the market today, and Alphabet has infused it throughout its products, including its core search business. AI-powered features, like AI Overviews, AI Mode, and Lens, have helped the company accelerate its search revenue, while its Gemini stand-alone app has also gained traction.\nAt the same time, its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) have become increasingly viewed as one of the top alternative AI chips to Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are in their seventh generation, and Alphabet uses them to power much of its internal workloads, giving it a huge structural cost advantage. Meanwhile, the chips are so highly regarded that Anthropic has committed to buying $21 billion worth of them next year.\n\nAs time progresses, the advantage Alphabet has of owning both top-notch AI chips and a top-tier LLM should only widen, as it creates a powerful flywheel that will make both better over time.\nThe case for Amazon While Alphabet was able to change investor perceptions this year, Amazon was not. However, the company could now be in a similar spot to where Alphabet was heading into 2025.\nMuch of Amazon's lackluster recent performance can be tied to the growth of AWS, which trails that of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. However, Amazon saw AWS revenue growth accelerate to 20% last quarter, and the company said it was capacity-constrained. As such, it's boosting its capital expenditure (capex) budget to try to meet growing demand.\n\nStory Continues\nAt the same time, the data center that it built for Anthropic, featuring its custom Trainium chips, is still ramping up. It is also in talks with OpenAI about making an investment in the company, where OpenAI would start to use some of its AI chips. The two companies already signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal, although that was to use Nvidia GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce business is really clicking. The company is seeing huge operating leverage come from its robotics and AI investments, while its high-margin sponsored ad business is growing quickly from a large base. This could be seen in its third-quarter results, as its North America revenue rose 11%, while its segment adjusted operating income soared 28%.\nThe verdict Alphabet and Amazon are two of my favorite stocks heading into 2026. Both stocks are trading at attractive valuations with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) of below 30 times and solid growth prospects ahead.\nI think Alphabet is going to become one of the biggest winners in AI over the long term, but for 2026, I think Amazon's stock can outperform. As AWS revenue continues to accelerate and Trainium gains some traction, Amazon can begin to shift perceptions, much like Alphabet did last year. I think that will really help power a stock that is trading well below other leading retailers like Walmart and Costco, which have forward P/Es nearing 40 times.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Sam Altman Calls Google 'A Huge Threat', Says The Tech Giant Would Have Been Able To 'Smash' OpenAI In 2023\n\nNamrata Sen\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSam Altman , the CEO of OpenAI , expressed concerns about Google’s dominance in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He believes that Google’s immense power and business model could pose a significant threat in the AI space.\nAltman Warns of Google's AI Power Altman, in a conversation with Alex Kantrowitz on the Big Technology Podcast , highlighted the potential danger that Google’s AI capabilities pose.\n“Google is still a huge threat…you know extremely powerful company,” stated Altman.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nHe reflected on the situation in 2023 when Google’s AI efforts were not as effective due to their product direction. Altman suggested that if Google had chosen to focus on OpenAI at that time, the latter would have been in a “really bad place.”\n“I think they would have just been able to smash us,” stated the OpenAI CEO.\n\nAltman also noted that Google’s business model is one of the strongest in the tech industry, and he believes that the company will be slow to relinquish it.\nHowever, he expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of Google simply integrating AI into existing systems like web search, suggesting that a complete redesign with AI at the forefront would be more successful.\n\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nAI Shake-Up Puts OpenAI Under Pressure Altman’s remarks come amid a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

The CNBC host had posted, \"It was only a matter of time before we heard from OpenAI about how it fell behind, and the rush of tens of millions of users right to Gemini 3 would be upon us.\"\n\nAltman’s analysis of Google also comes amid reports that OpenAI was eyeing a potential $1 trillion IPO, with the AI startup in discussions with investors for a $100 billion fundraise at a $750 billion valuation.\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

      "Content": "As Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\n\nEbube Jones\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nThe global artificial intelligence (AI) data-center market is projected to rise from roughly $236 billion in 2025 to $933 billion by 2030, a 31.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).​ That surge in infrastructure demand is exactly what Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google is targeting with its Gemini platform, and the new Gemini 3 Flash release is designed to deliver faster, more efficient AI that can run at scale.\n\nWall Street is starting to assign larger price targets to the stock. Pivotal Research recently lifted its price target on Alphabet to $400 from $350, reiterating a “Buy” rating and flagging roughly 25% upside from current levels. The call leans on multi-year Google Cloud growth and strengthening free cash flow as key supports for Gemini-driven expansion.\nMore News from Barchart Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling? JPMorgan Says This ‘Overall Top Pick’ Is Better.\nThe Saturday Spread: How a Little-Known Options Strategy Targets Asymmetric Upside (ORCL, NEE, IRM)\nThe 2 Riskiest Stocks Investors Are Betting On With Over 300% Upside\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWith AI expectations rising and GOOGL already re-rating higher in 2025, the stakes around each Gemini release keep climbing. So, as Gemini 3 Flash rolls out, is this the moment to buy, simply hold tight, or start taking profits in GOOGL stock? Let's find out.\nThe Numbers Behind GOOGL Alphabet is a California‑based global technology company that builds search, cloud, advertising, hardware, and AI products at mass scale.\nThe stock currently trades at $307.16, up 62.3% year‑to‑date. The market capitalization of roughly $3.7 trillion and a price‑to‑sales (P/S) ratio of 10.6x versus a sector median of 1.2x shows how much of a premium the market is willing to pay.\nAlphabet's latest earnings report showed third‑quarter net income of roughly $35 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.87 versus a $2.26 consensus, a 27% upside surprise. The company posted total revenue of $102.3 billion, with Google Services and Google Cloud contributing $87.1 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively.\n\nThe report also included GAAP operating income of about $31.2 billion, reflecting a 30.5% operating margin. Meanwhile, adjusting for a $3.5 billion European Commission fine pushed operating income to about $34.7 billion and the margin close to 33.9%, showing that scale efficiencies are offsetting higher AI‑related costs. That level of profitability translated into free cash flow of roughly $24.5 billion for the quarter and left Alphabet with close to $100 billion in cash and marketable securities, giving it ample firepower to fund Gemini 3 Flash.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL’s Proof-of-Demand Recently, Gemini secured a major win in the form of a contract with the Pentagon. That kind of validation matters more now because Gemini 3 Flash aims to push faster AI performance into real workflows — not just demos.\nOn the infrastructure front, Google Cloud’s landmark strategic partnership with NextEra Energy (NEE) aims to develop multiple gigawatt‑scale data center campuses in the U.S., each paired with dedicated generation and capacity. This collaboration indicates a deliberate effort to secure massive, long‑lasting footprints for power and data centers. The arrangement also deepens Google Cloud’s role within NextEra itself, using Google’s AI and infrastructure to drive an enterprise‑wide digital transformation.\n\nIn terms of commercial services, Colliers (CIGI) has selected Google Cloud as its primary cloud platform as part of a multi‑year plan centered on advanced analytics and AI‑powered products. That migration will move the firm's core systems onto Google Cloud to enable AI‑driven tools, predictive modeling, and integrated workflows across a data‑intensive, regulated industry. The deal is explicitly framed around Gemini‑powered automation and smarter market intelligence for roughly 24,000 Colliers professionals.\nFinally, ReNew Energy Global’s long‑term agreement with Google will back a 150 MW solar project in Rajasthan dedicated to Google’s electricity needs in India. This project adds to an already sizable renewable portfolio. More importantly, it tackles one of the most significant constraints on AI growth by securing reliable, low‑carbon power at scale close to where computing is needed.\n\nHow Wall Street Prices GOOGL Wall Street is lining up behind GOOGL ahead of its next earnings report. For the current quarter, the average EPS estimate sits at $2.59, up from $2.12 a year ago. Looking at next quarter, the EPS estimate is $2.52 versus $2.81 last year, a decline that cools near-term expectations.\nFrom a full-year perspective, the story looks more in sync with the bullish narrative. For fiscal year 2025, the average EPS estimate is $10.58 compared to $8.04 for the previous year, implying a hefty 31.6% increase.\nOn the ratings side, the Street’s stance on GOOGL is about as clear as it gets. Across 54 analyst opinions, the consensus rating is a “Strong Buy.\" The average price target is $329.08, implying upside from its current price.\nConclusion GOOGL looks like a “buy on strength, add on dips” story rather than a stock to dump after Gemini 3 Flash. Strong earnings, solid cash flow, and healthy growth estimates support that case. A broadly bullish analyst consensus with double‑digit upside also points to shares grinding higher over the next year, even if the pace cools versus the last 12 months. Most likely, the stock will continue to trend upward with pauses around earnings and AI headlines, rewarding patient buyers more than short‑term traders.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Buy With $1,000 for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Alphabet is considering selling its custom AI chips.\nTaiwan Semiconductor will thrive as long as AI spending stays elevated.\nAmazon is due for a comeback in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nWith 2026 quickly approaching, investors need to have a game plan for what stocks they will buy. Several interesting trends are brewing in the market, and may cause investors to think differently about how they want to invest. Still, I think some smart investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm could result in monster returns in 2026.\nThree smart stocks to buy with $1,000 right now for 2026 are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . All three of these are primed to outperform the market in 2026, making them great buys now.\nAlphabet Alphabet has been one of the best performing stocks in 2025, rising more than 60% so far. Alphabet's performance can be tied to multiple successes, including the continued dominance of its core business, Google Search; developing a leading generative AI model in Gemini; and considering selling its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to outside clients.\n\nThose are all significant developments that have answered many outstanding questions surrounding Alphabet's stock at the start of 2025, clearing the way for another successful year in 2026. Wall Street analysts expect Alphabet to grow its revenue by nearly 14% next year, which is impressive considering its business maturity. That isn't going to dramatically outperform the market, but it should be enough to propel Alphabet over the 10% threshold that many investors wish to exceed when picking individual stocks.\nAlphabet has transformed from an artificial intelligence laggard to an AI leader in 2026, and I believe that trend will continue to power the stock higher in 2026 and beyond.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Keeping up with which company is providing the best computing unit possible is exhausting. While Nvidia and its graphics processing units (GPUs) have dominated so far, other companies like Alphabet are starting to challenge its dominance. This sparring will go back and forth forever, but what won't change is where most of the chips are sourced from.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest foundry by revenue and is the primary source for high-end computing chips, such as those used in various computing units within AI data centers. As long as AI hyperscalers continue to build out their AI computing power, Taiwan Semiconductor will remain an excellent investment. With the AI hyperscalers informing investors that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, this thesis is on track.\n\nStory Continues\nTaiwan Semiconductor also trades for less than 23 times next year's earnings, making it the cheapest company on this list. Taiwan Semiconductor is set up for a great 2026 with all of the massive spending occurring, positioning it as a great stock to buy now.\nAmazon Amazon has had a disappointing 2025, with the stock essentially flat for the year. That's frustrating for investors, especially when stocks like Taiwan Semiconductor and Alphabet have done so well. However, this sets the stage for a comeback in 2026, especially behind the strength of its growing business units.\n\nWhile most view Amazon as an e-commerce company, that segment doesn't provide the majority of the profits. Instead, its cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services (AWS), does. In Q3, AWS generated the majority of Amazon's operating profits while growing revenue at a 20% pace. That's faster than the companywide 13% growth rate. When the most profitable business unit is also growing faster than the overall business, that's an excellent sign for investors.\nAnother area to watch is Amazon's advertising business. Amazon's ad business is the company's fastest-growing division, rising 24% in Q3. It has also grown to become a huge part of the business, allowing it to boost Amazon's margins as well.\nThe continued strength of both segments is key for 2026, and if they continue to do well, Amazon will make a comeback and be an excellent stock to buy and hold in 2026.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Photo by Kaboompics.com on Pexels\nDespite these concerns, the firm finds Meta’s 2026 expense guidance and LLM launch in the first half of 2026 as potential near term catalysts. Looking ahead, investors will remain focused on AI investment spend and the returns these investments may generate across core apps, advertising monetization, and new business opportunities.\nThe firm also mentioned in their investor note how management’s commentary regarding costs to build LLMs compared to licensing can help improve sentiment.\nMeta Platforms has been expanding its advertising capabilities and also invests heavily in artificial intelligence and the metaverse.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Business\nA $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\n\nFaizan Farooque\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAmazon is increasingly aggressive and smart in its battle to acquire a greater role in AI .\nAmazon will reportedly make a huge $10 billion investment in OpenAI, which shocked Wall Street and rattled Silicon Valley. If the Reuters report is confirmed in the not-so-distant future, the deal won't simply be about getting in on the hottest name in AI.\n\nIt would mean that Amazon is willing to put real money behind its chips, cloud, and reputation, even if it has long been seen as behind in the AI arms race.\nIt's also an uncommon move for Amazon that will have ramifications for chip stocks, cloud computing, and the planned OpenAI IPO .\nAmazon's AI problem and how $10 billion could fix it Amazon is a cloud powerhouse thanks to AWS, but when it comes to high-profile AI projects, it has fallen behind Microsoft and Google.\nYears ago, Microsoft put $13 billion into OpenAI. Google is sponsoring both its own DeepMind subsidiary and its competitor Anthropic.\nAs for Amazon, people have spoken a lot about its Trainium and Inferentia chips and released services like Bedrock, but investors weren't very impressed — until now.\n\nRelated: Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nIf Amazon invests in OpenAI, it will get one of the world's most valuable AI workloads.\nOpenAI previously inked a $38 billion cloud agreement with AWS , but this arrangement might go much further and require OpenAI to employ Amazon's proprietary processors. That goes directly against Nvidia 's supremacy and strongly supports Trainium's claim of low cost and high performance.\nIt also has a number of strategic uses:\nGets AWS a big-name AI customer.\nShows Wall Street that Amazon's story about bespoke silicon is true.\nTells clients that Amazon is decreasing the cost of AI computing.\nPortrays Amazon as a legitimate \"AI arms dealer\" with tangible infrastructure.\nAnd the market saw it. The revelation made Amazon's stock rise, and some experts say this is when investors started to see Amazon as a real \"AI play.\"\n\nA high-stakes deal, just as the cloud gets crowded The timing couldn't be better. AWS is still the leader in cloud market share , but it is seeing more competition from Microsoft, Google, and fast-growing \"neo-cloud\" firms such as CoreWeave and Crusoe.\nBig companies, including Capital One, have voiced concerns about the escalating prices of AWS. Some people are even thinking about switching suppliers or creating their own AI infrastructure.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nBank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\n\nStory Continues\nA collaboration with OpenAI helps Amazon respond to that criticism. It sends a message: AWS isn't simply selling computing power; it's constructing the infrastructure for AI on a large scale and at a lower cost.\nWhat if OpenAI trains GPT-5 on Trainium chips instead of Nvidia processors? That's a big gain for believability.\n\nIt's also a way to protect investments. Anthropic has already gotten money from Amazon.

      "Content": "Want to Invest in Quantum Computing? 3 Stocks That Are Great Buys Right Now\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:52 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nINTC\n\nIBM\n\nKey Points Google parent Alphabet is making waves with its new quantum computing processor.\nIntel's long-term comeback partially hinges on quantum computing.\nIBM's strength in supercomputing could help make it a leader in the quantum field.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nInvestors may struggle with what to make of quantum computing stocks . The technology increases the amount of computing power exponentially. Unfortunately, quantum computing is a highly error-prone technology, and in many respects, it is a solution without a problem.\n\nBoth tech giants and start-ups have undertaken efforts in this arena. Still, almost every start-up is a speculative, money-losing company with a nosebleed valuation. Knowing that, investors are probably wise to look at established companies building quantum computing segments.\nThese three companies below fit the bill. Let's have a closer look at them.\nAlphabet Admittedly, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has fostered a comeback recently based on artificial intelligence (AI). Thus, its investors seem focused on its latest Google Gemini update or the AI powering its autonomous vehicle segment, Waymo.\nHowever, investors should also not ignore its advancements in quantum computing. The company has built large-scale quantum computers focused on addressing error correction, a challenge that has plagued the quantum industry.\n\nTo that end, it incorporated what it calls a \"breakthrough algorithm\" on its Willow quantum processor that delivers quantum advantage. This applies the technology to problems in molecular science, materials science, and other areas.\nMoreover, investors can expect that quantum computing will play a more significant role in driving this company's revenue in the coming years. Alphabet holds $98 billion in liquidity and generated almost $74 billion in free cash flow over the last year. Hence, unlike the start-ups, investors know the Google parent holds the resources to compete in this field.\nFurthermore, even with Alphabet stock up by more than 60% over the last 12 months, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30 is close to the S&P 500 average earnings multiple of 31, meaning investors can buy this stock at a reasonable price.\n\nIntel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is another tech giant that investors have written off, as its chip industry competitors beat it on innovation, leaving investors with questions as to whether it could stay relevant in today's tech market. Nonetheless, current CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reorienting Intel with an engineering-first culture, and one area of focus is quantum computing.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company recently introduced its Tunnel Falls quantum chip, which it has made available for research. Also, its Horse Ridge II cryogenic control chip has helped it overcome scalability issues, one challenge quantum computing technology faces.\nAlso, despite its struggles in recent years, Intel has attracted investor interest, including from the Trump administration, which invested in the company earlier this year. Additionally, its free cash flow turned positive in the third quarter of 2025, coming in at $896 million. That helps give Intel the financial stability it needs to advance its technology.\n\nIndeed, its recent return to profitability makes its P/E ratio a poor measure of its valuation. Still, its stock is up by more than 80% over the last year.\nFurthermore, a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3 is below the S&P 500's 3.4 average and allows investors to buy into Intel's recovery at a reasonable price. As Intel's turnaround continues, now might be a good time to buy before more investors become aware of Intel's growing quantum capabilities.\nIBM In recent years, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has become better known for its cloud computing capabilities. However, it has long led the way in supercomputing, and to that end, it developed its first quantum computer in 2019.\nThe advancements have continued since that time, and it has just released its IBM Quantum Nighthawk, a 120-qubit computer that can run circuits with more complexity while keeping a lid on error rates. Looking forward, its quantum advantage promises improvements over classical-only problem-solving methods, and by 2029, it plans to deliver a \"fault-tolerant\" computer that incorporates technology to more efficiently correct errors.\n\nInvestors should expect such advancements to continue amid the $14 billion in free cash flow it forecasts for 2025. About $6.3 billion of that will cover its dividend, which rises annually and returns 2.2% yearly. That frees the rest of its free cash flow to invest back into its business.\nAdditionally, the stock is up more than 30% over the last year amid its growing relevance in today's tech world. Also, as the pace of growth rises, its 37 P/E ratio has become more palatable, positioning IBM for continued gains, which are likely to be increasingly driven by quantum computing in the coming years.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "The 3 Deep Learning Stocks That Could Be Worth 50% More by 2027\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:10 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Microsoft owns 27% of OpenAI, with massive Azure cloud contracts in the pipeline.\nAlphabet has come back to be a recognized leader in generative AI, with a big lead in autonomous vehicles.\nIntel has begun its turnaround, which should only accelerate in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n2025 is nearly over, and despite the strong year, many investors are biting their fingernails over the prospects for 2026. Will the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continue despite talks of a bubble and debt investors recently balking at funding large-scale data centers? Whom will President Donald Trump pick as the new Federal Reserve chair, and will the new nominee be independent?\n\nShort-term concerns always dominate headlines and investors' mindsets in the moment, but real long-term outperformance comes from taking a broader mindset and looking at the big picture.\nAssuming the AI buildout continues apace and AI usage increases over the next several years -- and there's no evidence AI adoption is slowing at all -- these three artificial intelligence stocks still look like they have upside. In fact, there's a case for 50% upside for each in 2026.\n1. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up a solid 15% year to date in 2025 but has pulled back in recent months. Investors have grown nervous over OpenAI's technical moat and ability to fund massive spending commitments. That's important for Microsoft, which is both a 27% owner of OpenAI and a cloud provider for $250 billion of OpenAI cloud computing commitments -- a result of the 2025 negotiations by which OpenAI converted into a for-profit company.\n\nThat ownership and cloud pipeline would be highly bullish for Microsoft, but doubt has crept in regarding OpenAI's lead in generative AI in recent months. Rival Anthropic has shown significant enterprise growth, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) released its impressive Gemini 3 model in November.\nStill, the fear may be misplaced. It doesn't seem likely that the AI revolution would be dominated by a single model builder, but rather by a cohort of winners in an oligopoly. That's how both the semiconductor and cloud computing sectors have evolved. The AI large language model (LLM) market will likely follow a similar path.\nAfter all, Alphabet was regarded as a loser in the AI race as recently as this year, only to retake the lead. OpenAI is certainly not going away, and this week's investment in OpenAI by Amazon appears to indicate that at least some astute executives and investors still believe in the company.\n\nWeiterlesen\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley sell-side analyst Keith Weiss just upgraded Microsoft stock, giving it a $650 price target, good for 35% upside from the current price. His analysis and conversations with management indicated that Azure AI demand is stronger than initially thought and that Azure AI's gross margins can expand with scale as more revenue is generated over the next two years. Furthermore, Weiss noted that his estimates don't even contemplate the full OpenAI contract, which could lead to further upside.\n\n2026 should also see the introduction of Microsoft's next-generation AI chip, named Braga. According to reports this past summer, the chip was initially planned for 2025, but a redesign pushed back its introduction by six months. If Microsoft can develop an impressive in-house-designed chip, as Alphabet and Amazon have, that could lead to even more optimism.\n2. Alphabet Speaking of Alphabet, it would definitely be possible for both Microsoft and Alphabet to appreciate 50% in 2026. While Alphabet has had the best year of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, up 62% on the year, Alphabet also entered the year as the cheapest of the bunch. In fact, despite this year's rise, it's still the second-cheapest of the bunch .\n\nComing into the year, investors were nervous that AI chatbots could disrupt Alphabet's Search business. However, that doesn't seem to be happening. Search paid clicks grew by 2%, 4%, and 7% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively, showing a reacceleration after Alphabet introduced AI Mode into Search in May.\nWith the November release of Gemini 3, Alphabet has seemingly taken the lead for the moment in the AI race across several benchmarks. What's even better is that Gemini 3 was trained on Alphabet's homegrown Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Following the Gemini release, other major companies are now looking to buy or lease TPUs from Alphabet or its cloud unit, Google Cloud.\n\nEven Alphabet rival Meta Platforms is reportedly considering using TPUs, according to late-November press reports. And just last Friday, Reuters reported a massive cloud deal worth over $10 billion between cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and Google Cloud.\nThat all bodes very well for Google Cloud, which has been an incredibly underrated part of Alphabet's business. Google Cloud has now reached scale, with a $60 billion revenue run-rate and an almost $5 billion operating profit run-rate as of the last quarter. Growth accelerated by 34% for that business in Q3, accompanied by margin expansion.\nSo not only could the Cloud unit become a second major profit center beyond ad revenue, but 2026 could also bring exciting developments for Waymo. Waymo is now delivering over 1 million autonomous rides per month, with a significant lead over competitors in scaling. Next year could bring about more disclosure around Waymo's revenue or valuation, which could add yet another major business to Alphabet's expanding empire.\n\n3. Intel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has had an even better year than Alphabet or Microsoft, up 83.6% on the year thus far. Of course, Intel was trading at a practically distressed price heading into 2025, below its book value and without a CEO. And despite the 2025 surge, its market cap is still far, far lower than all the supposed AI winners of today.\n\nMeanwhile, 2026 is shaping up to be an exciting year. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who joined the company in March, will begin to make his presence felt more noticeably. The all-important 18A node -- the node at which Intel predicts it will either equal competitors or regain its technology leadership in the industry -- will begin to deliver product. 18A has just begun high-volume manufacturing this quarter, with the first 18A product, Panther Lake, set to enter the laptop market in January.\nSuccess on 18A in the form of better revenue and margins could yield external customer wins for future nodes 18AP and 14A. Already, technology pundits are reporting that major companies such as Apple , Nvidia, and even Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices are looking to potentially use the 14A node for their server central processing units (CPUs), according to analysts for China research firm GF Securities.\n\nIf an external customer were to commit to Intel's 14A node, which is expected to be released in 2027 or 2028, there could be confirmation of the customer win during 2026. After all, there has already been a flurry of positive reports on 14A technology and the adoption of Intel's EMIB packaging technology over the past month or so.\nIf investors come to believe that Intel has pulled even or ahead in terms of process technology, financial results improve with 18A manufacturing, and/or Intel announces a significant external 18AP or 14A customer win for its foundry, there is still considerable upside left in the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock To Buy in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Alphabet is finally getting some recognition from investors for its AI accomplishments.\nThe search-engine giant has ample opportunities to benefit from increased AI spending.\nWhile the stock has gotten a bit expensive, it looks poised to fly higher in the long-run.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has served as an unprecedented bellwether for technology stocks over the last three years. In particular, semiconductor stocks including Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Broadcom were all ushered into the trillion-dollar club thanks to the AI revolution.\nAs investment in AI infrastructure continues to unfold, I think it's likely that chip stocks will remain sound investment choices. But as 2026 approaches, I see a different tech titan taking center stage: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nLet's dig into how Alphabet has built an AI fortress poised to dominate the future. From there, I'll explore the company's valuation trends and make the case for why now is a great time to buy Alphabet stock hand over fist.\nIt's been a quiet three years for Alphabet...until now The AI revolution kicked off almost exactly three years ago when OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT quickly captured the imaginations of people all over the world with its ability to answer virtually any question instantly.\nThe dramatic rise in popularity among large language models (LLMs) caused some on Wall Street to pose the idea that traditional search tools like Google were headed for doom. Think of the business stakes at hand here: Why would advertisers continue paying a premium on platforms like Google and YouTube when everyone's attention was flocking to chatbots?\n\nWhile Alphabet's advertising business did show some signs of stalling, the company's cash cow remained somewhat resilient. For a couple of years, revenue from Google and YouTube wasn't as robust as it once was, but it also wasn't plummeting at an alarming rate.\nWhat many investors were overlooking, however, was Alphabet's other ventures. At the beginning of the AI revolution, Google Cloud was operating at an annual revenue run rate of about $29 billion. Meanwhile, this segment of Alphabet's business was unprofitable.\nFast forward to today, and Google Cloud is now on pace for more than $50 billion of annual sales while boasting positive operating income. What's even more interesting is that Google Cloud has won major deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic -- the two LLMs that were once seen as the ultimate existential threat to Google's relevancy.\n\nStory Continues\nBesides the success of its cloud division, Alphabet has also successfully launched its own LLM -- called Gemini. According to management, Gemini has over 650 million monthly active users (MAUs) while search queries are increasing threefold quarter over quarter.\nWhy 2026 could be epic for Gemini For most of the AI revolution, I think the consensus view around Alphabet was one of uncertainty. While not everyone bought into the extinction of Google narrative, it's fair to say that it took some time for Alphabet to prove its AI ambitions were bearing fruit.\nOne of the biggest catalysts the company has going into next year is an extension of Google Cloud through commercializing custom hardware. Specifically, Alphabet's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), known as tensor processing units (TPUs), have seen some early traction with Apple and Anthropic.\n\nWhile TPUs aren't going to dethrone Nvidia's GPU business anytime soon, I think Alphabet is on the cusp of unlocking a new wave of growth in the cloud infrastructure market that's currently dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\nAlphabet stock could soar to new highs next year As of this writing, Alphabet's forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio is hovering around 28 -- its highest level during the AI boom.\nNormally, I tend to stay away from momentum stocks. More times than not, by the time a company reaches a record high, it's dicey to buy the premium and expect shares to move materially higher.\nThis is a rare instance where I think the opposite is true. Alphabet's current price increase reflects two factors: An appreciation for the company's current operating performance and a bullish outlook that Alphabet will keep up its strong performance.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem -- from search, cloud computing, consumer electronics, custom hardware, and more -- is a major differentiator compared to its mega cap peers. The company has a unique flexibility stitched into its DNA -- benefiting from AI across its various assets and subsidiaries during any market cycle. These dynamics position Alphabet as a particularly durable business for the long run.\nAs investments in AI infrastructure are expected to continue rising going into next year, I expect Alphabet to benefit from these tailwinds more so than any one singular chip designer or software developer.\nWith this in mind, I think Alphabet will continue to show signs of accelerating revenue and profit margin expansion across its entire business next year -- which should lead to even more buying from shareholders. Against this backdrop, I see Alphabet as the best opportunity in the AI landscape as 2026 approaches.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds in 2025 . On December 19, Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt lifted the price target on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to $350 from $320 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm told investors that consumer internet companies delivered solid returns in the year, averaging 23% across 24 covered companies compared to 19% for the NASDAQ. Wedbush expects performance to diverge in 2026, with investors taking into account factors such as the rising adoption of agentic AI, AI monetization, ongoing investment cycles, and AV disruption.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also received a rating update from Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post on December 18, who reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $335.00.\nIn a separate development, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported on December 9 that Google Cloud announced that the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) selected its Gemini for Government as the first enterprise AI deployed in the U.S. Department of War (DoW)’s GenAI.mil to 3 million civilian and military personnel.\n\nGemini for Government is an AI-optimized, enterprise-grade platform uniting industry-leading AI models, best of Google’s FedRAMP High and DoW Impact Level 5 (IL5) authorized commercial cloud, and agentic solutions that support the unclassified business processes of government agencies.\nAlphabet Inc.

But in recent disclosures, Fields has shown a preference to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Alphabet and Microsoft, but leaving out Meta Platforms and Amazon.com from purchases.\nWhile there could be more filings from Fields before the end of the year, the most recent disclosures point to a potential recent bias or preference for Alphabet stock heading into 2026. Nvidia was the top purchase in months like August and September, but the most recent months show Alphabet as a top purchase.\n\nStory Continues\nOutside of the Magnificent Seven, Fields has also been aggressively buying up Netflix stock, which comes with the company in the middle of a potential blockbuster acquisition of Warner Bros.

I can barely stand for my live show Opening Bid each day.\n\nOn Wednesday, I almost passed out on a rowing machine. My trainer told me, while I was on the ground, \"No one is coming to save you. Get your ass up.\"\nIt was much-appreciated motivation for the self-motivated me.\nAnd I want to give you a similar shot of inspiration as we get ready to enter 2026: No one is coming to save your portfolio from complacency on AI stocks.\nHow's that Oracle ( ORCL ) you bought in September working out? Still riding the once-buzzy CoreWeave ( CRWV )? I imagine in both cases, things are not looking too rosy. Why? Because you did no homework on these companies — and simply bought them because they were AI-related and in the news.\nDo better!!\n\nThe reality is you have to think beyond the obvious AI stocks in 2026 to drive gains. Beyond the richly valued \"Magnificent 7.\" Beyond a company like Oracle, whose billionaire CEO, Larry Ellison, is also trying to help his son buy a struggling Warner Bros. ( WBD ). You have to think deeply about where else the AI trade will appear and create value.\n\nMap this stuff out on a whiteboard if you have to!\nAI is having a profound impact inside companies. As a result, it will drive a good bit of positive earnings surprises in many of the other 493 companies housed in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nHere are two examples of the work you need to be doing on AI investing.\nThe appetite to own AI plays is broadening to more under-the-radar names, including companies that are using the technology aggressively in the industrial sector. One of those companies is logistics giant C.H. Robinson ( CHRW ), led by one of the best CEOs you probably never heard of: David Bozeman .\nBozeman has led the 120-year-old logistics player for more than two years, after stints in transportation operations at Amazon ( AMZN ), Harley-Davidson ( HOG ), and Caterpillar ( CAT ).\n\nSince Bozeman's arrival, C.H. Robinson has leaned hard into AI to improve operating profits. Its stock price is up 55% in 2025. FYI, Meta's ( META ) stock is only up 11% this year! That's despite Bozeman telling me in a new episode of my Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (video above) that the economy isn't growing too quickly and the freight recession continues.\n\nLa historia continúa",

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "1 Quantum Computing Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in December\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet has made several major breakthroughs in quantum computing.\nThe company can invest heavily in that nascent technology if it chooses.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nThe market is currently pivoting toward a risk-off approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and stocks in adjacent tech areas such as quantum computing. As a result, many quantum computing pure plays have sold off. However, that hasn't affected my top quantum computing stock pick for December: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nWhile the tech giant doesn't have the upside potential of the smaller quantum computing players, it is far steadier. Furthermore, it has resources that its competitors can only dream of.\nAlphabet has proven its quantum computing prowess The smaller quantum computing companies are all-in on the technology, and if they don't succeed in producing systems that attract a significant customer base, they're likely to go to $0. Many of them will fail.\nAlphabet, by contrast, doesn't need its quantum computing endeavors to succeed. It's developing the technology for in-house use and to rent access to through Google Cloud. But Alphabet is already spending tens of billions of dollars annually on hardware for its cloud and AI infrastructure. Anything it can do to reduce its input costs for future computing resources is a smart move.\n\nIt has already done this in the AI accelerator segment, developing a family of application-specific integrated chips it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPU) in conjunction with Broadcom . This has given Alphabet some experience in developing custom computing hardware.\nAlphabet's quantum computing chip, Willow, has already made waves in the industry. In October, it announced that a Willow chip ran an algorithm that, for the first time ever, demonstrated a verifiable quantum advantage. Its quantum computer ran that algorithm 13,000 times faster than the world's fastest supercomputer could have.\nThis was a huge step toward commercial viability for Alphabet's quantum computing hardware, and investors shouldn't be surprised if the company announces further milestone achievements in 2026. Yet unlike its smaller quantum computing competitors, Alphabet doesn't need to trumpet every little breakthrough because it is self-funding its research. The pre-earnings start-ups, by contrast, need publicity to help them attract money from research partners and the public markets to stay alive.\nBecause it has no need to please researchers or impress shareholders with its quantum computing progress in particular, Alphabet is free to pursue its own path with the technology. That's a huge advantage.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet has resources its competitors can only dream of Another reason why Alphabet is my top quantum computing stock now is that its business already produces enormous quantities of cash that it can plow into whatever growth avenues it chooses. Currently, a lot of that money is being spent to construct data centers for AI computing, but if quantum computing turns out to be all that it has been hyped up to be, Alphabet could easily devote a large chunk of its cash flow toward advancing its position in that technology.\n\nThe two metrics that investors should pay attention to on that front are operating cash flow and free cash flow. Operating cash flow is the total amount that the business generates from operations, while free cash flow measures what's left after it covers obligations such as interest expenses and taxes, and also capital expenditures. While a vast amount of Alphabet's cash flows are going toward its data center buildouts, it still has plenty available to devote to other ambitions such as quantum computing.\nFor Alphabet, it wouldn't be a stretch to throw $10 billion at its quantum computing unit, but it's a sum that the pure plays could only dream of. Because of its superior resources and the achievements it has already made in the space, I think it will be a force to be reckoned with by the time useful quantum computing comes to market. It also isn't a boom-or-bust investment, making it a far safer stock to own than its smaller quantum computing competitors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This Quiet AI Company Could Be the Next Big Winner\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SOUN\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points SoundHound AI has rapid revenue growth but steep losses.\nMost of its Q3 loss was due to a one-time accounting charge.\nSoundHound has some similarities to Palantir from three years ago.\n10 stocks we like better than SoundHound AI ›\nThe dramatic rise in tech stocks over the last two years has made a lot of investors wealthier -- and that's something to celebrate! But when we're done patting ourselves on the back for a job well done with Nvidia , Alphabet , and Palantir Technologies , it's time to look for the next big thing.\n\nThat's because it's easier to have dramatic gains when you're starting with a smaller market capitalization . Palantir had a market cap of less than $50 billion when I first bought the stock in 2022, and its current $431 billion market cap now makes it one of the largest companies in the world.\nIts stock has gained 2,210% since July 2022. And if it were to gain another 2,210% in the next three years, it would have a market cap of $10 trillion -- more than twice as large as the current market leader, Nvidia.\nObviously, that's not happening. To find an artificial intelligence (AI) stock with the potential for a Palantir-size gain over the next three years, we need to examine one that still has significant growth ahead. One that I'm considering right now is a stock I've been skeptical about in the past: SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) .\nWhat is SoundHound AI? SoundHound operates an AI platform that allows users to have conversations to use voice-enabled services and apps. Voice-enabled products have been around for a long time -- for example, automated customer-service phone numbers and voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa. However, the early iterations of this technology were clunky enough to create significant user frustration.\n\nSoundHound, which went public in 2021, primarily worked in the automotive and restaurant industries before taking a significant step forward in 2024 with its $80 million acquisition of Amelia AI, an AI agent that is customizable for internal use or public-facing applications.\nThe acquisition pushed SoundHound's corporate client base to more than 200 customers. However, the company still hasn't been able to turn a profit, and investors may have signaled this year that they're becoming concerned about the stock: Shares are down more than 40% this year.\nPart of the problem may be the company's third-quarter earnings report, which showed a sharp net loss of $109.3 million, versus a loss of $21.7 million a year ago. The loss wiped out its impressive $42 million in revenue, which was up 68% from a year ago.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, $66 million of the loss was due to a noncash, nonoperating accounting charge related to previous acquisitions. The adjusted net loss was $13 million, which was an improvement from a year ago. And most importantly, the business ended the quarter with zero debt and cash on hand of $269 million.\n\nIn addition, SoundHound is increasing its client base, including by the following:\nA deal to integrate SoundHound Chat AI into \"double-digit millions of AI-enabled smart devices\" developed by an unnamed Chinese company.\nAn agreement with an Italian commercial-vehicle company to install voice AI in its fleet.\nExpansions of the scope of contracts with three top financial services institutions.\nAn agreement with a U.S. regional hospital system to deploy the Amelia platform.\nA deal to supply a national full-service restaurant chain with voice-ordering technology.\nAn agreement with a telecommunications provider that offers TV and internet in 20 U.S. states.\nWhat should you expect from the stock? Analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance are unanimous in their prediction that SoundHound stock will move higher in the next year. The mean price target of $17.19 is 53% higher than the current stock price; the low price target of $15 is 33% higher.\nSoundHound may not replicate Palantir's rapid growth, but I see many similarities between the two companies. Three years ago, in the second quarter of 2022, Palantir was losing money, too -- it posted a net loss in the quarter of $179.3 million as it was building out its platforms.\n\nManagement has expanded SoundHound's business model to include a variety of functions, including customer service, sales, marketing, operations, and IT service management. The company has enabled more than 10 billion personalized automated voice conversations annually.\nAs companies strive to become more efficient and increasingly reliant on AI solutions to streamline their products while still personalizing customer interactions, SoundHound AI's growth is expected to continue. Clearly, I've misjudged this company with my aforementioned skepticism. Because when its quarterly losses start turning into gains, I think the stock will skyrocket in the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in SoundHound AI right now? Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.
