      "Content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 18)\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:50 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThis year, one of the better performers among the Magnificent 7 had been Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ: META ). But its third-quarter earnings report raised investor concerns about the company’s massive capital spending on artificial intelligence initiatives. In addition, Meta says it plans to make significant cuts to the budget of its Reality Labs metaverse division in the coming year. The stock is down 13.6% since the quarterly report was released.\n\nStrong quarterly reports earlier this year (despite a tax charge) had lent credence to the claim that Meta would continue to outshine its competitors over the next year. The share price hit an all-time high of $796.25 back in August. Due to the recent pullback, the stock is up 4.9% year over year, underperforming the broader market. Furthermore, the near-term future of the economy is uncertain—just like the markets themselves—and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a controversial figure. Certainly, Zuckerberg's sudden shift to the metaverse and brand name change to Meta Platforms raised a few eyebrows several years ago.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Meta Platforms Inc.’s ( NASDAQ: META ) AI push has been a key driver for the company in 2025, with integrations coming across numerous platforms, which is fueling engagement and increasing ad sales.\nDespite economic cloudiness, Meta announced that its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) estimate increased significantly, much of which will be allocated to AI project development and integration.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNow, the Meta Platforms CEO is shifting the company's focus and riding a powerful, bullish trend. Against this complex backdrop with many moving parts, investors should consider the wide range of Meta stock price targets and formulate a strategy for all possible outcomes. To help, 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis. Let's jump in.\nWhy Invest in Meta Platforms? Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room. Investors should not rely on Meta Platforms' Reality Labs metaverse business to drive the company's near-term future growth. In Q3 2025, Reality Labs generated $470 million in revenue, up from $370 million in revenue in the prior quarter. However, during that same time frame, Reality Labs recorded a loss from operations of $4.43 billion.\n\nFortunately, it appears that the CEO's attention has turned to a different tech field lately. In particular, Zuckerberg seems to expect AI to be Meta Platforms' key driver going forward. AI integrations into Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp could provide an economic moat for Meta Platforms if new features translate to greater user engagement. WhatsApp, in particular, has seen notable growth with more than 3 billion monthly users now.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta's AI focus evidently helped the company succeed in the third quarter of the year despite losses in its metaverse business. Impressively, Meta Platforms grew its revenue 26% year over year to $51.2 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus call for $49.5 billion. Furthermore, excluding a one-time tax charge, the company's earnings per share (EPS) surged 20% to $7.25, easily outpacing the analysts' consensus estimate of $6.74.\n\nThere's no doubt that Zuckerberg is all-in on the AI revolution now. He envisions a future in which AI will be used for \"a lot\" of \"social tasks.\" And he believes it's \"really compelling\" that AI will \"get to know you better and better.\" Some reporters have expressed skepticism of an AI-infused future. Yet, if Meta Platforms can parlay machine learning into profits, investors shouldn't dismiss the growth potential of Meta stock.\nAnother key driver for Meta Platforms is its Threads short-form messaging platform. Granted, Threads is still playing catch-up to the popular X platform, which is owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Still, Threads is making inroads as its monthly active user count grew from 320 million in 2024's fourth quarter to 350 million in Q1 of 2025. That's not at the level of X, which reportedly has more than 580 million monthly active users. Yet, perhaps AI feature integration can make Threads even more competitive with X in the coming quarters.\n\nThe company expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenue to range from $56 billion to $59 billion. That is expected to be driven primarily by ongoing strength in its advertising business, bolstered by the positive impact of AI-driven enhancements to ad targeting and user engagement across its family of apps.\nMeta Platforms as a Stock It is impossible to know how the economy will perform going forward. Similarly, it remains unclear whether Meta Platforms will achieve significant returns on its AI investments. These unknowns will not stop analysts from publishing their Meta stock price predictions, though.\nOppenheimer and Benchmark downgraded the stock following the third-quarter earnings release, citing increased capex concerns. However, BofA Securities has reiterated its Buy rating on the shares, keeping its price target at $900 and affirming long-term confidence in Meta, citing its user base and potential AI integration opportunities. Cantor Fitzgerald also reaffirmed its positive stance by reiterating an Overweight rating and $920 price target. It anticipates that improvements in AI execution will lead to a \"sentiment reversal\" for the company in 2026.\n\nThe aforementioned uncertainties are reflected in the wide range of Wall Street analysts' price targets for Meta Platforms. The Zuckerberg-led firm has a high price target of $1,117.00, a median price target of $837.92, and a low target price of $685.00. However, the consensus recommendation of 67 analysts covering the stock remains to buy shares.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$685.00\n5.5%\nMedian\n$837.92\n29.0%\nHigh\n$1,117.00\n72.0%\n\nMeta Platforms 2025 Outlook Meta Platforms raised its 2025 capex estimate from a range of $66 billion to $72 billion to a range of $70 billion to $72 billion. By now, you can probably guess what Meta Platforms is spending those extra billions on. If you guessed AI, you are correct. More specifically, Meta Platforms' management anticipates \"additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.\"\n\nHence, the multi-billion-dollar question is whether Meta Platforms can effectively leverage its costly AI enhancements. That's difficult to predict. The same goes for the state of the economy, which might not support an increase in ad spending if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate in the remainder of this year.\n24/7 Wall St.'s Meta forecast is a more bullish than the mean forecast, calling for the share price to rise to $935.29 by the end of next year. That implies a run of 44.0%. It is based on the company’s ability to sustain strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency. This should drive its bottom line despite higher capital expenditures for AI objectives.\nUltimately, your price target for Meta Platforms stock should depend on whether you expect the company to take full advantage of ramped-up AI features. If so, then get ready for Meta Platforms stock to eventually head for new all-time highs. However, it may be a bumpy ride along the way.\n\nMeta’s Heavy AI Spending Justified Says Pro. Is He Right?\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided. The report also discusses market trends, drivers of the leading Cloud service providers' capex growth during the quarter, and the outlook for the next year.

What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Boasts Significant Upside Potential Despite Morgan Stanley Price Target Cut\n\nNeha Gupta\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:15 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMS\n\nGOOG\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) is one of billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2026 . On December 11, Morgan Stanley cut its price target of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to $750 from $820 while reiterating an Overweight rating.\nMeta App 3D sign\nThe price cut comes amid concerns that sentiments around the social media networking stock have turned negative. That’s in part because of growing fears about revenue durability, operating expense uncertainty, and issues around the company’s Llama AI model. The shift in sentiment comes amid growing confidence in Alphabet’s prospects, buoyed by the tech giant’s AI initiatives.\n\nDespite the cut, the price target represents a significant upside potential. Additionally, Morgan Stanley insists Meta is one of the few companies that can leverage its data, distribution capabilities, and AI investments to generate long-term value.\nAdditionally, the stock came under pressure after the company detailed plans to develop a closed, monetizable AI model incorporating technology from Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba. Avocado is the proposed AI model slated for release next spring. Meta will reportedly retain control over the closed AI model, marking a significant departure from the open-source model it has championed over the years.\nThe Pivot towards a closed model is part of an effort to address the disappointments associated with Meta’s Llama 4 Open Source model.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a tech giant focused on connecting people through social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), advertising, and building the future of the internet with virtual and augmented reality (Metaverse, Quest headsets, AI), aiming to blend digital and physical worlds for work, play, and connection.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the Top AI and Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. On December 4, analyst John Blackledge of TD Cowen maintained a “Buy” rating on the company’s stock, retaining the price objective of $810.00. The analyst’s rating is backed by a combination of factors highlighting Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s strategic cost management and potential for earnings growth.\nOne of the main reasons is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s plan to significantly reduce its Metaverse-related expenses, which form part of the Reality Labs segment. As per the analyst, such cost reductions are anticipated to be ~30% by 2026, potentially leading to savings of $5 billion – $6 billion. Notably, this move can help partially mitigate the increased spending on AI infrastructure, which happens to be a key area of investment for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Stanley reduced its price objective on the company’s stock to $750.00 from $820.00, while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. While the firm reduced its price objective, it believes that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) happens to be one of the few selected companies that could leverage leading data, distribution capabilities, and AI investments to fuel earnings power and maintain technological leadership.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
