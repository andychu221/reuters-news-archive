      "Content": "An X-Ray View of the Magnificent Seven\n\nJohn Dorfman\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:38 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBy John Dorfman December 22, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate)\nFor the past three years, a huge share of the stock market's action has been in the Magnificent Seven , a small group of super-successful, super-popular stocks.\nThere are signs of fatigue in this leadership group. But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

      "Content": "Is Meta Stock a Buy After Its AI Spending Spree?\n\nLyle Daly, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:21 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms has invested heavily in AI and plans to ramp up spending even more in 2026.\nThese AI investments have drawn comparisons to Meta's costly metaverse venture.\nThe key difference is that Meta's AI spending is already driving growth for its ad business.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) plummeted after its third-quarter earnings report, largely due to the company's significant artificial intelligence (AI) spending -- and plans to spend even more in 2026. From Oct. 29 to Nov. 20, Meta's share price fell 22%, from $752 to less than $600.\nInvestors are concerned that AI will become the next metaverse , which has cost Meta over $70 billion since 2021. However, there's a crucial point that many are overlooking.\nMeta's AI investments are paying off The metaverse has been a money pit so far, and there's a good chance it will never pay off in a meaningful way. AI, on the other hand, is already providing legitimate value for Meta. The social media company has integrated AI tools into its ad products, enabling companies to optimize ad designs, set up automated rules that pause or boost ads based on performance, and receive AI-powered ad insights.\n\nThese tools have contributed to better ad engagement, higher prices, and more money for Meta. Ad impressions were up 14% year over year in the third quarter of 2025, and the average price per ad increased by 10% year over year. Revenue for the first three quarters of the year was $42.3 billion (a 16% year-over-year increase), $47.5 billion (a 22% increase), and $51.2 billion (a 26% increase).\nWith $44.8 billion in trailing free cash flow (FCF), Meta can afford to make substantial investments in AI. While the metaverse flashbacks are understandable, AI spending could be a winning move for Meta. I still consider the company a buy, and I've been picking up shares during the dip.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Google started the year behind in the AI race. It ended 2025 on top.\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:03 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nCRM\n\nGoogle ( GOOG , GOOGL ) entered 2025 in a difficult position. While its stock price rose 36% in 2024, the company was still largely perceived by Wall Street as playing second (or third) fiddle to OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) in the AI race.\nFast-forward to today, and Google is stealing the show, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a \"code red\" emergency as the company works to match Google's latest Gemini 3 AI models. It's an interesting twist, given that Google declared its own code red after ChatGPT hit the market in 2022.\n\nGoogle is also catching up to OpenAI in the key monthly active user (MAU) metric.\nThen there are Google chip wins. In October, Claude developer Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) announced it was expanding its plan to use Google's AI chips, including using up to 1 million processors , to power its AI software.\nGoogle is also in talks to provide its chips to Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta ( META ) to run its AI products, according to The Information .\nIt all added up to a strong 2025 for the search giant, setting it up for continued success in the year ahead.\n\"Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in CY26,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a Dec. 11 investor note.\n\"Google is in the strongest position when it comes to a fully integrated AI stack,\" he wrote. \"Gemini is a leading model, its user base is expanding faster than OpenAI's, Search is integrating AI effectively with ads reportedly on the way, and [Google Cloud Platform] continues to hold its ground in the infrastructure buildout cycle.\"\n\nGoogle's AI wins pile up Google counts its AI revenue as part of its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) business. According to the company, that has given GCP a significant boost. In Q3, Google said its GCP revenue grew 34% year over year to $15.1 billion . It rose 32% in the prior quarter.\nThe number of new customers to the GCP jumped 34%.\n\n\"Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.\nAccording to Pichai, Google signed more deals worth more than $1 billion in its third quarter than it did in the previous two years combined. More than 70% of the company's existing cloud customers are using its AI services, he added.\nThe company has also more deeply intertwined its AI capabilities with Google Search, launching its ChatGPT-like AI Mode for all US users in May at the Google I/O conference and dropping ads into AI Overviews in search.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle has also managed to win over social media users with its Nano Banana AI image app, which went viral in August. Then came the biggest bomb: Gemini 3.\nAnnounced in November , Gemini 3 immediately won praise from users, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who said he was ditching ChatGPT after using the app for Gemini 3.\n\nGemini 3 sent shockwaves through the AI industry, unseating GPT-5.1 as the leading AI model across several categories.\nGoogle's user base is also growing. According to TD Cowen's John Blackledge, a survey of roughly 2,500 US consumers found that Gemini's MAU penetration ramped faster than ChatGPT's from July to October.\nGemini MAU penetration was 24% in July and climbed to 26% in October. Google's AI Mode also improved from 18% to 19%. ChatGPT, however, saw its MAU penetration decline from 36% to 35% in the same time period.\n\nMarket intelligence firm Sensor Tower says that both apps continue to see significant growth, with global MAU up 180% and 125% for ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively. But like TD Cowen, Sensor Tower found that ChatGPT's MAU grew roughly 15% between August and December. Gemini was up 30%, thanks in part to its Nano Banana image editing app.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that Gemini is also available on all newer Android devices, making it far easier to access than ChatGPT, which requires users to navigate to a website or download the ChatGPT app.\nGoogle's other beats AI wasn't the only bright spot for Google in 2025. While the company lost its second antitrust case in April, with a judge finding it holds an illegal monopoly through its online advertising business, its legal issues weren't all bad.\nIn September, a judge declined to force Google to give up its Chrome browser after he found the company holds an illegal monopoly over the search market.\nThe judge also allowed Google to continue to make payments to \"distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or GenAI products.\"\nThat means the company can continue to pay Apple upwards of $20 billion a year to make Google Search the default search option on its iPhone and other devices.\n\nOutside of its legal dramas, Google has also made major strides with self-driving car company Waymo. The firm expanded its availability to other cities — including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando — and began offering freeway driving around San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\nGoogle also showed off its prototype smart glasses and a new Samsung VR headset, both of which use software based on a version of Android called Android XR, which was developed by Google and Samsung.\nLook for that and more in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Elon Musk’s Net Worth Up $215 Billion in 2025\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk’s net worth is up by $215 billion this year to $647 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That increase is almost as much as the total net worth of the sixth-richest man in the world. That is, Mark Zuckerberg, who is the founder and CEO of Meta, has a net worth of $234 billion. Another estimate from Forbes puts Musk’s net worth above $700 billion. The measurements from the two sources rarely match exactly.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk’s net worth is up sharply this year to at least $647 billion.\nThere is speculation that his net worth could top $1 trillion.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThere are several reasons for the Musk wealth increase. There is speculation that Musk’s net worth will top $1 trillion when SpaceX, which he founded and of which he is the largest shareholder, goes public next year with an estimated valuation of $800 billion or more. His exact ownership is 43%. However, his voting share is 79%.\nTesla’s stock is up 21% this year. Its market cap is $1.63 trillion. Musk owns over 15% of Tesla, and a new pay package could take that figure much higher. A fight in the courts over a stock award turned out to be in Musk’s favor two days ago. The package was worth $139 billion. (One argument that Musk’s net worth is lower than most estimates is that the eventual stock option values cannot be valued on the day they are given.) Musk also has a pay package worth about $1 trillion, but he has 10 years of hurdles to clear before he makes that.\n\nxAI is a merger of social media company X and xAI, one of the world’s largest artificial intelligence companies. At the time of the transaction, in March, X was valued at $33 billion ($45 billion, less its $12 billion in debt) and xAI at $80 billion. By some estimates, Musk owns about half of xAI, which is in a race with OpenAI and the AI arms of several public companies, including Alphabet.\nThe reason the Bloomberg figure can only be an estimate is that the value of private companies is hard to peg.\nRising From the Ashes Musk’s increase in net worth is something of a phoenix rising from the ashes. Tesla stock dropped from just below $400 a share at the start of 2025 to $220 in April. Musk’s rocky relationship with President Trump and a decline in Tesla sales were blamed for that. However, the shares have recovered to over $485 apiece.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Musk has said Tesla is much closer to having a fully autonomous vehicle. If these cars go on sale to the general public, Musk’s net worth is likely to soar again.\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\n\nAmin Ayan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIBIT\n\nBLK\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nBlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025, ranking the product alongside Treasury bills and US mega-cap technology stocks.\nKey Takeaways:\nBlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech.\nIBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\nThe fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025.\nThe performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand.\n\nNate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.\nThe latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival.\nBlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could Meta Platforms Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is sparing no expense to achieve personal AI superintelligence.\nWhat matters most to Meta's long-term success is how AI can bolster user engagement, as well as ad capabilities for customers.\nThe stock is a compelling buying opportunity today, but it's not going to provide life-changing returns.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nSince its initial public offering in May 2012, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , formerly called Facebook, has seen its share price rise 1,640% (as of Dec. 19). That means that had you invested $58,000 in the business at the time it hit the public markets, you'd have $1 million today. That's a great gain in less than 14 years.\nThese days, the investment community isn't doubting how wonderful a company this is. Meta is one of the most dominant technology enterprises in the world, with impressive growth and profitability . And it continues to operate at a high level.\nIf you've been watching the \" Magnificent Seven \" stock from the sidelines, you're probably wondering what the future will bring. Could Meta Platforms help you become a millionaire?\nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg views AI as a big opportunity We are in the middle of what could shape up to be one of the major technological shifts in history. Companies are scrambling to basically go all-in on artificial intelligence (AI). Like other tech giants, Meta is not hesitating to spend on its AI efforts. The business is projecting $70 billion to $72 billion of capital expenditures in 2025, which \"will be notably larger in 2026,\" according to CFO Susan Li. The money will go toward technical infrastructure.\n\nMeta also spent heavily to assemble an AI all-star team earlier this year to help create Meta Superintelligence Labs, bringing on top scientists and researchers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's objective is to achieve personal superintelligence, essentially being a tool for people to achieve and do more.\nThe strategic rationale makes sense. Meta must spend copious amounts of capital or it will risk falling behind in the AI race. At the end of the day, what matters most for this business is how AI will drive more users and engagement on its apps, as well as higher ad spend from ad customers.\nWhen it comes to digital advertising, Meta is performing extremely well. Ad revenue increased 26% year over year during the third quarter. Zuckerberg believes AI will expand the total addressable market for digital ads.\n\n\"I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today,\" he said on the Q1 2025 earnings call. That's if Meta can continue to make progress on improving ad capabilities for its customers. Investors will surely want to see a positive long-term impact on earnings and free cash flow from this huge AI focus.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms shares are worth owning If you say that Meta is one of the best businesses on Earth, you wouldn't find many people who disagree with you. The company's defining attribute is the presence of unbelievably powerful network effects . During the third quarter, its family of apps counted an astonishing 3.54 billion daily active users. People want to use these platforms because everyone they know is using them. And with more users, the platforms improve over time.\n\nMeta's unrivaled reach, as exemplified by its immense user base, might be enough of a reason for investors to consider owning shares. When a network effect has become this robust, it's incredibly difficult (maybe even impossible) to disrupt.\nTo be fair, though, this doesn't mean rival social media platforms can't enter the mix. Think about Snap or TikTok. This shows that competition for attention is fierce. However, Meta can observe certain features and tactics that are working well for its peers and immediately integrate those into its own apps, with broad adoption occurring instantly. This helps it maintain such a dominant position.\nThe business should be on every investor's watch list. The stock could do well over the next five or 10 years, thanks to a compelling valuation and strong earnings growth. But Meta isn't some small, early-stage company whose stock is going to skyrocket, so unless you have a six-figure sum to invest today, this isn't a millionaire-maker opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

The company’s much-anticipated AI model, Llama 4, failed to live up to the hype, fueling further dissatisfaction.\nDespite these hurdles, Zuckerberg remains committed to AI investment, with Wang at the helm of the enigmatic TBD Lab, tasked with creating a novel flagship AI model, codenamed “Avocado”.\n\nHowever, there has been some skepticism within Meta regarding Wang’s capability to oversee large research teams, considering his expertise lies in AI data services rather than pioneering AI models.\nThe pressure is also mounting on former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman , who was recruited to incorporate AI models into Meta’s offerings. The urgency to deliver has led to premature product launches.\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nAmid these leadership challenges, several high-ranking executives have exited Meta, and the company has dismissed 600 employees from its AI divisions. Meta’s AI capital expenditures are projected to hit a minimum of $70 billion this year.\n\nMeta has contested certain elements of the report, asserting that public leaderboards can be misleading and that recent policy issues were based on examples that were “erroneous and inconsistent” with its guidelines.\nWhy It Matters : The reported dissatisfaction of Wang, a key player in Meta’s AI initiative, could potentially impact the company’s ambitious AI projects. The internal strife and high-level departures may further destabilize the company’s AI efforts.\nAdditionally, the criticisms of rushed product releases and the failure of the Llama 4 model underscore the challenges Meta faces in its pursuit of AI dominance.\n\nStory Continues\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial 2 . In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities 1 . The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy ® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy ® 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial 1 . The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy ® pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management.\n\n“The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy ® pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy ® injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy ® pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy ® pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”.\nNovo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy ® pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025.\n\nAbout the OASIS trial programme\nOASIS was a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3 programme consisted of four trials, enrolling approximately 1,300 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.\nOASIS 4 was a 64-week efficacy and safety phase 3b trial of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg versus placebo in 307 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout Wegovy ®\nWegovy ® is now approved as once-daily Wegovy ® pill (semaglutide tablet 25 mg) and once-weekly Wegovy ® injection (semaglutide injectable 2.4 mg) by the FDA. The approval of Wegovy ® pill is based on a New Drug Application to reduce excess body weight in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical condition.\n\nWegovy ® is approved as a once-weekly injection by the EMA and widely by other regulatory authorities. The Wegovy ® pill is currently pending marketing approval from the EMA and other regulatory authorities.\nWegovy ® is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults with obesity or overweight and in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, and approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Furthermore, Wegovy ® injection is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older, and approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nAbout Novo Nordisk\nNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

Uh, you emphasize strong seasonal trends, Eric, you point out solid earnings growth, you talk about, you do raise some some questions on your radar as well. What what would those be Eric as we head into 2026?\n00:17 Eric\nWell, first off, uh always a pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me, Josh.\n00:22 Eric\nUh there's a lot of great momentum.\n00:27 Eric\nI think um the questions are simply one, valuation, right? And we and we know that.\n00:36 Eric\nUm concentration, right? We know that the top 10 stocks in the S&P now account for 40% of the value of the S&P. That is\n00:47 Eric\nas concentrated uh as we've ever been.\n00:52 Eric\nAnd we actually know from history, if you go back to 1970, once we get over 30% in those top 10, going out the next five years, there's a 95% chance\n01:06 Eric\nthat the other 490 are going to outperform those top 10.\n01:12 Eric\nUm so I'm concerned about concentration. And then of course with AI, look, AI is real. This is a game changer. It's going to change the world.\n01:20 Eric\nBut a lot of this is definitely focused on Open AI. Open AI is is right out there saying, hey guys, we're going to be losing money for a long time. We might be profitable\n01:30 Eric\n2030.\n01:32 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient and wait while all this capX happens and money's being invested and we're not seeing that ROI yet.\n01:43 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient with that? You know, I'm not sure. I think there's going to be a lot of volatility.\n01:49 Speaker A\nIn terms of that AI trade, Eric, looking ahead in 2026, do you think about, listen, I'll I'll just, I'll stick with the Mag 7 as a basket or do you feel like no, I'm going to have to be more discerning next year. It's going to get tougher. Maybe it's the mag 3 or four.\n02:04 Eric\nUh it's a great question. I mean, look, we're not stock pickers at the Wealth Alliance, we're more asset allocators.\n02:10 Eric\nI think if you own the Mag 7, I think you're going to be okay. Let's not forget, the Mag 7 the last decade has grown its earnings 20-fold.\n02:19 Eric\nThat is a 35% compounded versus about 8% for the S&P.\n02:25 Eric\nI think it's okay to have Mag 7 exposure and you should. My concern is when I see a lot of new clients are coming into the firm, they're just loaded up in tech.\n02:34 Eric\nAnd they're not diversified. And I'm I just hit my 40th anniversary doing this. and I remember 1999 and 2000, seeing the same thing. People just loaded up in the same stocks. That was just gets me all nervous. Stay diversified.

      "Content": "Billionaire philanthropy’s growing divide: Mark Zuckerberg stops funding immigration reform as MacKenzie Scott doubles down on DEI\n\nAshley Lutz\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:17 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s decision to cut off funding to the pro‑immigration group FWD.us marks a sharp turn away from the high-profile social advocacy that once defined his philanthropy, even as MacKenzie Scott is emerging as the era’s most aggressive backer of equity- and DEI-driven causes.\nThe split shows a broader divergence in tech philanthropy: one billionaire channeling resources into science and AI infrastructure, the other pouring unrestricted billions into institutions serving communities historically excluded from power and wealth.\n\nFor more than a decade, FWD.us was a marquee example of Zuckerberg’s attempt to fuse Silicon Valley muscle with Washington policy, pushing immigration and criminal justice reform from the political center.\nBut in 2025, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) quietly stopped funding FWD.us—its first year without support from Zuckerberg; his wife, Priscilla Chan; or their philanthropy—formally ending a relationship that began with a 2013 launch op‑ed and hundreds of millions of dollars in backing, Business Insider reports .\nThe wind‑down was years in the making: By late 2022, CZI had already begun pivoting away from social advocacy, providing “foundational” funding meant to give FWD.us runway before the partnership ended, and in April 2025, the break was formalized. The timing now reads less like a slow fade than a strategic alignment with Zuckerberg’s rightward political recalibration in the Trump era, as Meta relaxed content rules criticized by conservatives, while the company and its CEO leaned into the new administration.\n\nZuckerberg bets on science and AI CZI’s new pitch sounds less like a traditional foundation and more like a research lab: Its leadership talks about GPUs, not gala dinners. In November, Zuckerberg and Chan announced tha t CZI would concentrate on science and AI, doubling down on the Biohub network of biology labs it has funded since 2016 and recruiting researchers with the promise of massive compute power rather than more office space.\n\nWhere early CZI grants were scattered across immigration, criminal justice, and education policy, the current strategy funnels capital into building infrastructure—data, tools, and models—that scientists can use for decades. The bet is that by underwriting AI‑enabled biomedical discovery and related fields, CZI can claim long‑horizon, system‑level impact without the political volatility that accompanies hot‑button social debates like border policy or policing.\nMacKenzie Scott’s DEI commitment MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is moving in the opposite direction, embracing the very equity agendas many corporations and campuses are backing away from under political pressure. In 2025 alone, she announced roughly $7.1 billion in donations—bringing her total giving since 2019 to more than $26 billion—with a heavy tilt toward historically Black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, Native scholarship providers, and organizations serving low‑income and underrepresented students.\n\nStory Continues\nHer recent gifts include $70 million to the United Negro College Fund to build pooled endowments for 37 HBCUs and tens of millions of dollars to Native Forward, the largest scholarship provider for Native students, along with a record $42 million to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit focused on first‑gen and predominantly non‑white students.\n\nScott’s model is explicitly trust‑based : large, unrestricted checks, minimal public involvement in governance, and repeat funding for equity‑focused organizations that can demonstrate impact in closing opportunity gaps.\nTwo models for tech wealth Zuckerberg and Scott now represent two poles of philanthropy: technocratic infrastructure versus redistributive equity. CZI is building a capital‑intensive platform for science and AI, betting that breakthroughs in biology and computation will ultimately benefit society at scale, even if the pathway is indirect and the beneficiaries diffuse.\n\nScott, by contrast, has become one of the most visible counterweights to the backlash against DEI, using outsize checks to stabilize and empower institutions led by and serving communities of color, low‑income students, and other marginalized groups.\nIf CZI’s exit from immigration reform signals that politically exposed advocacy is now a liability for at least one Silicon Valley titan, Scott’s acceleration suggests there is still room—and appetite—for philanthropy that takes sides in the fight over who gets access to power, capital, and education.\n\nFor this story, Fortune journalists used generative AI as a research tool.

Not strategy, not creative, just the mechanical work of building hundreds of ad creatives. I realized if we were hitting this ceiling, a lot of other teams probably were too.\"\nAds Uploader is designed for agencies, in-house teams, and media buyers launching high volumes of creative or managing multiple client accounts. The platform supports bulk campaign creation, ad duplication, team accounts, and multi-account management.\nPollard added that affordability was a deliberate design choice. \"From the outset, my objective has been to enter the market at a price point that remains accessible to teams of all sizes, without compromising on the level of control or professionalism required by advanced media buyers.\"\n\nSince its initial release, Ads Uploader has expanded its feature set to support more advanced advertising workflows.

Unless we see something dramatic over the next week, Amazon will end up as the worst-performing “Magnificent 7” constituent this year.\n\nWhile the coveted group did not have a roaring year with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META) underperforming the S&P 500 Index and Tesla (TSLA) only slightly nudging ahead following the recent rally, Amazon’s underperformance stands out.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone.

Sign Up Now!\nAmazon entered 2025 as a “top pick” for many brokerages—a distinction it had held for the previous couple of years. However, the stock failed to live up to expectations and is on track to underperform the broader markets by a wide margin. Notably, while Amazon shares outperformed in the preceding two years, riding the artificial intelligence (AI) mania, they underperformed in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn fact, over the last five years, AMZN is up just 43%, which is just about half of what the average S&P 500 Index constituent has delivered. Meanwhile, brokerages are quite bullish on the stock’s prospects, and BMO, TD Cowen, Wedbush, Truist, J.P. Morgan, and Evercore ISI have named Amazon as a “top idea” or equivalent for 2026.\nWhy Did Amazon's Stock Underperform in 2025? Barring brief periods, particularly following the Q3 2025 earnings release, Amazon stock underperformed peers this year. There’s a lot that’s making markets apprehensive, which is reflected in the stock’s price action. Here’s a brief overview:\nRising Competition : Amazon is facing competitive pressure from legacy brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart (WMT), as well as Temu and Shein, which have become popular with their ultra-low-cost merchandise.\nMarket Share Losses in AWS : While Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) growth has rebounded, it continues to lose market share to Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), which are growing at a much faster rate.\nCapex Taking a Toll on Cash Flows : The Amazon story was never about GAAP earnings, but the stellar cash flows that it generated. However, the burgeoning capex, particularly towards building the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, is taking a toll on the company’s free cash flows. Amazon’s trailing 12-month free cash flows plunged to $14.8 billion at the end of Q3 2025, while the corresponding numbers in 2024 and 2023 were $47.7 billion and $21.4 billion, respectively. While AI could drive Amazon’s growth and help the company lower costs, intermittent concerns over tech companies’ ability to monetize their AI investments have put pressure on their stock prices.\nImpact of AI : While AI would positively impact nearly all aspects of Amazon’s business, there are concerns that the rise of third-party AI shopping agents is a threat to Amazon’s lucrative and fast-growing digital advertising business.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN Stock 2026 Forecast Brokerages are upbeat on Amazon’s forecast, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 56 analysts covering the stock. AMZN’s mean target price of $295.80 is 30% higher than the current price levels. The stock trades even below the most pessimistic target price of $230, while the Street-high target price of $360 represents a potential upside of 58%.\nShould You Buy Amazon Stock? While Amazon’s e-commerce growth in developed markets might have plateaued, the company should be able to bolster its growth. Amazon is doubling down on groceries and has even launched a private food brand, which would help it increase its total addressable market. Haul, which is Amazon’s platform to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, should also help the company earn additional revenues. Amazon's business-to-business (B2B) platform, Amazon Business, is another potential growth driver to watch, and it is already running at a multi-billion-dollar gross revenue run rate.\n\nPrime should also help drive Amazon’s growth next year, and we might even see the company hike prices. The company has started cracking down on Prime password sharing and should ramp up ads in 2026, which would help it increase its digital ad business.\nAMZN stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 31.7x, which looks quite tempting to me even as earnings growth might be tepid over the next couple of years on higher depreciation expenses emanating from the AI capex.\nI find Amazon among the best structural growth stories, as the company is a play on several high-potential sectors like e-commerce, cloud, streaming, digital advertising, and now even AI. I have been bullish on Amazon stock for quite some time, and while I did book some profits earlier this year, I have used the recent dip to add more shares.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AMZN, META, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOG.

      "Content": "Get Ready for a Fruity Facebook as Meta Preps New Mango AI Model. Should You Buy META Stock Here?\n\nChris MacDonald\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 9:02 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is among the most-watched mega-cap tech stocks in the market, and for good reason. The company's core social media empire, which started with Facebook and has since expanded to include Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, now has more than 3.5 billion daily active users across all of its networks.\n\nOver the decades, the company has monetized these eyeballs to an incredible extent, now generating incredible profits and cash flow that the company piles into its other high-growth initiatives. Of late, that spending has materially shifted from tens of billions of dollars a quarter on its Reality Labs division (its metaverse efforts) to Meta's growing artificial intelligence portfolio.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone.

Sign Up Now!\n\nRecent headlines around Meta's potential unveiling of its new Mango artificial intelligence model alongside its Avocado model could propel significant future growth, and investors appear to like what they see (see chart above). Let's dive into why this video-focused AI model could be the future and what investors may want to think about when it comes to this tech giant's fundamentals moving forward.\nWhat's All the Hype About? Meta's new Mango platform brings about another fruit-named AI model to the mix, this time focusing on video content creation, something that could bolster the company's Reels and Instagram Stories profit drivers. The integration of application-specific models is something we're seeing ramp up, and Meta appears to be intent on utilizing AI to boost its profits directly. Allowing consumers to produce more content with the help of AI across its social media platforms is a use case that certainly makes sense. This launch, in combination with Avocado (which should make coding easier for the company's existing tech talent), could lead to a double whammy of a surge in content with less headcount. Those are the kinds of efficiencies Meta hopes can drive significant margin and valuation multiple expansion over time.\nLooking at Meta's overall profit margin of nearly 38%, a hefty number for any tech company of its size, the company is clearly doing a lot right. With a price/cash flow ratio of just 21 times, investors can achieve a free cash flow yield of nearly 5% on this stock, which is certainly healthy. This, in addition to a petite dividend yield of around 0.3% at the time of writing, is more than the yield on fixed-income securities. In combination with some solid price appreciation expected in the years to come (I'll get into analyst price predictions below), META stock could be a very profitable bet right here.\n\nStory Continues\nI think the company's forward price-earnings multiple of just 22 times is reasonable given Meta's expected growth boost due to its AI integrations and, specifically, the margin- and efficiency-boosting nature of these launches. Of course, a lot of this stock's future upside will ultimately come down to how these launches are viewed by the public, and the jury is out on that front. But for now, I think Meta's recent dip, attributed to concerns around absolute levels of AI spending, could be alleviated if investors see the kind of upside Meta's management team is expecting to highlight next year.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Think of META Stock Here? The 55 Wall Street analysts covering Meta give this stock top grades, expecting META stock to hit an average of somewhere around $840 per share next year.\nImpressively, the high target on the Street pegs META stock at $1,117 per share in a year to 18 months down the line. That would imply upside of around 70% from here, with the consensus target around $840 per share still implying more than 27% upside over the next year.\n\nI don't think these price targets are too aggressive at all. In fact, this is a top stock on my watch list for 2026 as a potential AI winner. Given the company's strong underlying cash flow generation profile and its growth prospects tied to these new AI model releases, I think there's a lot to like about how Meta is valued currently.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "How Caterpillar Crushed the Magnificent 7 in 2025 — And It’s Not Done Yet!\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nQuick Read Caterpillar ( CAT ) rose 61% in 2025 to become the top Dow performer. Caterpillar outpaced six of the seven Magnificent 7 tech stocks.\nCaterpillar’s Energy and Transportation segment drove gains with Q3 power generation sales up 31% from AI data center demand.\nCaterpillar raised guidance to 5% to 7% annual sales growth through 2030 with adjusted operating margins reaching 21% to 25% at $100B sales.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate market headlines in 2025, many of the stocks most closely tied to the technology -- the Magnificent 7 stocks of Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) -- have shown volatility or lagged.\nSix of the seven have experienced mixed or negative returns at points throughout the year, with broad concerns over valuations, sector rotations, and sustainability weighing on performance. In contrast, one unexpected name has outperformed six of the seven: Caterpillar ( NYSE:CAT ), the heavy equipment manufacturer. On a total return basis (capital appreciation plus dividends), Caterpillar trails only Alphabet by about one percentage point or so as of last Friday's close. Yet less than two weeks ago, Caterpillar was even ahead of Alphabet in year-to-date gains.\n\nSo, how is a traditional industrial company easily outpacing some of the world's largest tech giants?\nCaterpillar's Strong 2025 Performance Caterpillar has risen approximately 61% in 2025 compared to Alphabet's roughly 62 % gain, leaving the heavy equipment manufacturer just behind the tech behemoth and with the potential to surpass it by year-end.\nIt also stands as the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , edging out Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) in second place, and significantly outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7, with only Nvidia, which has returned almost 35% this year, coming close.\n\nWhat Is Doing the Heavy Lifting for Caterpillar Caterpillar's outperformance stems from strong demand in its Energy and Transportation segment, particularly generators and power equipment for AI data centers and infrastructure. Partnerships like the one with Vertiv ( NYSE:VRT ) for data center power solutions have highlighted Caterpillar's role in supporting AI growth.\nEnduring global infrastructure spending and mining demand have also contributed, but the real standout has been in power generation and oil and gas, segments that saw sales rise 31% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nTariffs posed challenges earlier in the year, with estimated costs up to $1.8 billion in 2025, but the company mitigated impacts through cost controls and pricing adjustments. Still, inflation continues to weigh on margins, with consolidated operating profits slipping 3%.\nHowever, these drivers that carried Caterpillar higher in 2025 appear sustainable into 2026, with analysts pointing to ongoing AI-related power needs and potential infrastructure rebounds. The risks of tariff escalation and cyclical slowdowns in construction or mining remain present.\n\nKey Takeaway Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar often deliver the best returns when bought during downturns to capture upside as cycles recover. Caterpillar began rising in late 2022, gained strongly in 2023, and delivered about 24% returns in 2024. In 2025, shares faltered on tariff fears in April before doubling from those lows.\n\nAt this point in the cycle, Caterpillar remains a solid holding, with tailwinds from AI infrastructure and global demand likely continuing into next year and beyond. Their strength allowed management to raise guidance for the next five years.\nCaterpillar is now expecting 5% to 7% compound annual sales growth through 2030, adjusted operating margins of 15% to 19% at $60 billion in sales and 21% to 25% at $100 billion in sales, and $6 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow—a 20% to 50% increase over prior estimates. While valuations are elevated with the stock trading well above its five-year average across most metrics, the structural shift toward power generation supports further gains rather than an imminent peak.\nAI's strong tailwinds will likely carry Caterpillar stock beyond the typical cyclical decline, and though investors should monitor economic indicators and keep an eye on whether AI is truly in a bubble phase or not, taking profits now may be premature given the outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Despite initial promises to value Windsurf’s team, the deal now looks more focused on the startup’s intellectual property than its people.\n\nWondery Is cutting 100 jobs , and its CEO, Jen Sargent, is departing.

      "Content": "Do Nebius Mega Deals Increase Customer Concentration Risk?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMETA\n\nMSFT\n\nNebius Group N.V. NBIS has rapidly positioned itself as a major player in the AI cloud and infrastructure market, driven by unprecedented demand for GPU capacity and long-term contracts with large technology companies. On the third-quarter 2025 earnings call, management highlighted the signing of two transformative mega deals: a contract with Microsoft valued between $17.4 billion and $19.4 billion and a new agreement with Meta worth approximately $3 billion over the next five years.\n\nThe company emphasized that demand continues to outstrip supply, with all available capacity sold out each quarter. Management noted that every time new capacity is brought online, it is immediately absorbed by customers. These agreements provide long-term visibility into revenue and utilization as Nebius accelerates its expansion toward 2.5 gigawatts of contracted power and up to 1 gigawatt of connected capacity by the end of 2026. The company expects these deals to be a key contributor to its ambition of reaching $7 billion to $9 billion in annualized run-rate revenue by the end of 2026, with more than half of this target already booked.\nHowever, Nebius has tightened its full-year group revenue outlook to a range of $500 million to $550 million from the previous guidance of $450 million to $630 million. The company expects to land in the middle rather than the upper end, primarily relating to the timing of capacity coming online. Although the company expects adjusted EBITDA to turn slightly positive at the group level by year-end 2025, it will remain negative for the full year.\n\nThe company is grappling with macroeconomic uncertainties, rising expenses and heavy capital spending. For 2025, Nebius has raised its capital expenditure guidance from approximately $2 billion to around $5 billion. Elevated capital expenditure levels pose a risk if revenue growth fails to keep pace with the company’s capital intensity, particularly in an environment where AI demand may fluctuate amid competitive pricing pressures and evolving regulatory frameworks.\nMoreover, the scale of the Microsoft and Meta contracts inevitably raises customer concentration risk. A substantial portion of future revenue growth is expected from these two customers beginning in 2026, with Microsoft reaching full annual run-rate contribution from 2027 and Meta largely at full run rate in 2026. This reliance means that performance, timing of deployments and ongoing demand from a small number of very large customers could have an outsized impact on Nebius’ financial results. While these mega deals provide stability, financing advantages and rapid scale, they also heighten exposure to concentration, making continued diversification across start-ups, enterprises and other large customers critical to balancing growth with risk.\n\nStory Continues\nTaking a Look at NBIS Competitors’ Deals & Partnerships CoreWeave, Inc .’s CRWV revenue backlog expanded sharply to $55.6 billion in the third quarter, up 271% year over year and nearly doubling sequentially. The growth was fueled by large, long-term agreements with major customers like OpenAI, Meta and other hyperscalers, highlighting robust demand for AI-centric cloud infrastructure. The company’s momentum was also supported by multi-billion-dollar partnerships with NVIDIA, including industry-first rollouts of GB300 NVL72 systems and RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances, giving CRWV an early advantage in frontier AI and real-time workloads. Moreover, the company is expanding through acquisitions, adding Marimo in October after earlier deals such as OpenPipe and Weights & Biases.\n\nAlphabet Inc. ’s GOOGL investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are growing. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, and increasing number of data centers are helping Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3 and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Recently, Alphabet’s Google Cloud and NextEra Energy announced an expanded partnership to develop multiple new gigawatt-scale data center campuses with accompanying generation and capacity.\nNBIS’ Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Nebius have gained 212.3% in the past year compared with the Internet – Software and Services industry’s growth of 30.7%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation-wise, Nebius seems overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +10.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 7.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $8.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.8%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $30.15 indicates a change of +28.7% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $58.37 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +20.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $198.76 billion and $233.55 billion estimates indicate +20.8% and +17.5% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Meta Platforms reported revenues of $51.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.2%. EPS of $7.25 for the same period compares with $6.03 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $49.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.63%. The EPS surprise was +9.68%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(META) Bolsters AI Glasses with new Software Update for Noise Reduction\n\nNeha Gupta\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:39 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nSPOT\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) is one of the best forever stocks to buy according to hedge funds . On December 16, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) confirmed a new software update for its AI glasses. V21 is the latest software update that introduces features that enhance conversations in noisy environments and integrate with Spotify.\nThe software update comes with a conversation focus feature that amplifies users’ voices in loud settings like restaurants, trains, and concerts. The feature leverages the AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to make voices sound slightly louder amid background noise. Spotify integration will deliver the first multimodal AI music experience for the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses.\nMeanwhile, Meta Platform is expanding its Instagram Reels service to television screens. Instagram for TV is a new feature that will allow users to watch reel content on larger screens. It marks an essential milestone in the company’s push to extend its short-form video content beyond mobile devices, as it looks to compete with other short-form video services.\n\nOn December 11, Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak cut the price target on Meta Platforms to $750 from $820 but maintained an Overweight rating. While remaining bullish into 2026, the firm trimmed FY26 and FY27 EPS forecasts by about 8% each due to higher operating expense assumptions, now projecting $33 in FY27 EPS.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) builds social technology to connect people, operating major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, primarily making money through targeted advertising, while heavily investing in the future of immersive tech like VR/AR via its Reality Labs division.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Meta Platforms Inc's Intrinsic Value\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's ( NASDAQ:META ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nIs META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $706.47. It's currently trading at a price of $658.77. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 6.75%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$22.61\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 25.40% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n469.82\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n544.46\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n706.47\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $541.53. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -21.65%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nLire la suite\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nCGU et Politique de confidentialité\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: These Could Be the Biggest Stock-Split Winners of 2026\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:04 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nNFLX\n\nMETA\n\nORLY\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is a prime candidate for a stock split.\nMeta Platforms has never conducted a stock split, but its stock is at a level where many companies would consider a split.\nBoth companies have tremendous growth prospects.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nWhat were the biggest investing stories of 2025? A few especially stand out.\n\nThe steep sell-off and subsequent rebound after President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement is one. The continued artificial intelligence (AI) boom warrants a prominent mention. Several major stock splits were newsworthy as well, notably Netflix 's (NASDAQ: NFLX) 10-for-1 split in November and O'Reilly Automotive 's (NASDAQ: ORLY) 15-for-1 split in June.\nI suspect more stock splits will be on the way in the new year. I'll even go out on a limb and predict two of the biggest stock-split winners of 2026.\nA Latin flair If there's any stock that's a prime candidate for a stock split, it's MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) . Shares of this Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader currently hover around $1,960. And that reflects a decline from recent highs. MercadoLibre's shares traded above $2,000 throughout much of 2025.\n\nSurprisingly, MercadoLibre has never conducted a stock split since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2007. That hasn't been a problem so far, though. The company's share price has skyrocketed more than 70x since its IPO.\nMercadoLibre is the 800-pound gorilla in Latin American e-commerce. It's one of the region's leading fintech companies, ranking either No. 1 or No. 2 in monthly active users in all of the countries it serves. MercadoLibre is also building an impressive digital advertising business, which currently holds the third-largest market share in Latin America.\nDespite its past success, the company still has tremendous growth opportunities. The markets that MercadoLibre is targeting have a combined population exceeding 500 million and a GDP of around $5.5 trillion. E-commerce penetration lags significantly behind that of the U.S. and China. Financial services in Latin America are already being disrupted, but there is still a long way to go.\n\nGive this social media stock a like Like MercadoLibre, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has never conducted a stock split. Shares of the social media giant currently trade around $660. That's a level where the management teams of many companies would consider a stock split.\nMeta's family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp) attract more than 3.5 billion active users daily. That's roughly 42% of the world's population looking at at least one of the company's platforms each day.\n\nStory Continues\nAs you might expect, advertisers are willing to spend a considerable amount of money to get their products and services in front of this massive audience. Meta expects to generate around $200 billion in revenue this year, with roughly 97% of the total coming from advertising.\nHowever, Meta's opportunities aren't limited to social media. The company is the clear leader in smart glasses, with sales of its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and Oakley Meta AI glasses surging. CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that glasses are the \"ideal form factor for AI.\"\n\nSpeaking of AI, Meta is also investing heavily to push the envelope with the game-changing technology. The company has formed a team of top experts to develop AI superintelligence (ASI). Some think ASI is decades away, but Zuckerberg wrote in July, \"Developing superintelligence is now in sight.\"\nWinners in 2026 Will MercadoLibre and Meta Platforms conduct stock splits in 2026? I don't know. Neither company has indicated plans for a stock split so far. However, I wouldn't be surprised if one or both of them announce splits next year.\nIf this does happen, I suspect that it will spur investor interest in the stocks. To be clear, stock splits do not change a thing about the underlying business of a company. They do, though, lower share prices to levels that could entice more retail investors to buy.\n\nEven if neither MercadoLibre nor Meta conducts stock splits in 2026, I think both stocks should be big winners next year. The growth opportunities for both companies remain attractive – split or no split.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $469,438 !*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $52,063 !*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $509,039 !*\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee the 3 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 15, 2025\nKeith Speights has positions in MercadoLibre and Meta Platforms.

      "Content": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other S&P 500 Company. Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Riding the AI wave? You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds in 2025 . On December 19, Wedbush slashed the price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to $880 from $920 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm told investors that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is its top advertising pick for 2026, supported by monetization of new channels, solid adoption of Advantage+, and strong digital ad trends. While the firm anticipates margin contraction in 2026, it believes that upside can be attained through additional cost discipline.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) also received a bullish outlook from RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson on December 17, who reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock and set a $810 price target.\nIn a separate development, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) introduced SAM Audio on December 16, which is the first unified AI model capable of segmenting sound from complex audio mixtures through the use of visual, text, and time span prompts. Management reported that the technology holds the potential to transform video and audio editing and support innovation in domains like television, film, music, podcasting, accessibility, scientific research, and more. SAM Audio marks the latest addition to the company’s Segment Anything collection, revolutionising audio processing by easing the isolation of any sound from complex audio mixtures.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) builds technological products that allow people to share, connect, grow businesses, and find communities. These products help people connect through personal computers, mobile devices, virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR) headsets, and wearables.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

I can barely stand for my live show Opening Bid each day.\n\nOn Wednesday, I almost passed out on a rowing machine. My trainer told me, while I was on the ground, \"No one is coming to save you. Get your ass up.\"\nIt was much-appreciated motivation for the self-motivated me.\nAnd I want to give you a similar shot of inspiration as we get ready to enter 2026: No one is coming to save your portfolio from complacency on AI stocks.\nHow's that Oracle ( ORCL ) you bought in September working out? Still riding the once-buzzy CoreWeave ( CRWV )? I imagine in both cases, things are not looking too rosy. Why? Because you did no homework on these companies — and simply bought them because they were AI-related and in the news.\nDo better!!\n\nThe reality is you have to think beyond the obvious AI stocks in 2026 to drive gains. Beyond the richly valued \"Magnificent 7.\" Beyond a company like Oracle, whose billionaire CEO, Larry Ellison, is also trying to help his son buy a struggling Warner Bros. ( WBD ). You have to think deeply about where else the AI trade will appear and create value.\n\nMap this stuff out on a whiteboard if you have to!\nAI is having a profound impact inside companies. As a result, it will drive a good bit of positive earnings surprises in many of the other 493 companies housed in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nHere are two examples of the work you need to be doing on AI investing.\nThe appetite to own AI plays is broadening to more under-the-radar names, including companies that are using the technology aggressively in the industrial sector. One of those companies is logistics giant C.H. Robinson ( CHRW ), led by one of the best CEOs you probably never heard of: David Bozeman .\nBozeman has led the 120-year-old logistics player for more than two years, after stints in transportation operations at Amazon ( AMZN ), Harley-Davidson ( HOG ), and Caterpillar ( CAT ).\n\nSince Bozeman's arrival, C.H. Robinson has leaned hard into AI to improve operating profits. Its stock price is up 55% in 2025. FYI, Meta's ( META ) stock is only up 11% this year! That's despite Bozeman telling me in a new episode of my Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (video above) that the economy isn't growing too quickly and the freight recession continues.\n\nStory Continues",

      "Content": "Advisors Target Diversification in 2026 Strategies as Mag 7 Risk Rises\n\nDebbie Carlson\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nIf 2025 ends strong, it will be the third straight year that the S&P 500 has notched double-digit gains. Not too shabby.\nBut that has many advisors worried about valuations in the large-cap space, especially in technology stocks connected to artificial intelligence. The Magnificent Seven, including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, now comprise one-third of that index’s market value. Some advisors are looking to diversify away from those names, and note that clients are worried that the market is due to correct. After all the hand-holding, however, advisors should remind clients why diversification matters to their financial plans, said Patrick Runyen, director of organic growth at Modera Wealth Investing. He’s been reducing large-cap and international exposure in order to rebalance after this year’s run-up in both sectors.\n\n“What we’re talking about with clients is keeping the diversified strategy in place and selling high and buying low on the margins,” he said.\nSUBSCRIBE: Receive more of our free Advisor Upside newsletter. READ ALSO: Schwab Scraps its Premium Robo Advisor Platform and Are Model Portfolios Key to Alt Adoption?\nWith All the Trimmings For many advisors, the first step is trimming exposure to the Mag 7 names, even if that means selling some of this year’s best-performing companies. “Almost at this point, it represents an asset class because it’s so demonstrably different than other equities,” said Bill Harris, CEO at Evergreen Wealth. “It’s not a diversified position … It’s a high-risk position, so if you’re looking for risk-adjusted return, you ought to move away from it. But that doesn’t mean get out.”\n\nHe remains invested in large-cap stocks but is breaking up the S&P 500 index into individual securities to modify exposure to the Mag 7. “You’ve got hundreds of individual securities, (so) you can do a heck of a lot better job with tax-related things such as tax-loss harvesting or asset location across taxable and tax-deferred accounts,” he said.\nOn the flip side, Steve Conners, president of Conners Wealth Management, said he’s looking at the large cap healthcare sector, particularly at pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. “The artificial intelligence theme has left them mostly ignored. Valuations are still attractive at current levels,” he said. He is avoiding health insurers in the broader healthcare space, however, saying they remain under too much pressure with the focus on rising health insurance premiums. “I’m not really interested in being the hero on United Healthcare or any of the health insurers.”\n\nStory Continues\nApply for Financial Aid Large-cap financials remain inexpensive compared with the broader market as well. “They are always less expensive, but they seem, on a relative basis, better than usual. Money-center banks look more attractive than the regional and community banks as they don’t have as much leverage to loan volume and interest rates, besides being less risky,” Conners said.\n\nRoland Chow, financial planner and portfolio manager at Optura Advisors, also expects financials to do well in 2026 with the push for deregulation by the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve cutting rates. Energy and materials are among Chow’s 2026 favorites for two reasons: They are adjacent to the AI boom by supporting the value chain, and they should benefit from the secular bull market in commodities and energy.\nGiven the broader market volatility, he said active management can take advantage of classic market factors such as momentum, value and quality. He is also keen on diversifying by size, and looks to add small and mid-cap exposure, saying lower interest rates should give smaller companies a tailwind. Factors will separate the winners and the losers in sectors such as healthcare, financials, energy and materials, he said, “because not all companies are equal even though they are in the same sector.”\n\nInternational Still Worth It With the Fed cutting rates, a weaker dollar continues to make international investing appealing in both developed and emerging markets, advisors say, and valuations are still attractive. Conners said even with this year’s gains in developed international markets, he still believes Western Europe is “a great place to invest.”\n\nEmerging markets could have a lot of growth potential, but Conners advocates using mutual funds or exchange-traded funds to get exposure rather than picking stocks since it’s difficult for most advisors to do the research necessary. In the equities sleeve, he allocates between 10% and 15% toward international for both developed and emerging markets.\nHarris also likes developed and emerging markets. How much he devotes to foreign stocks depends on the client, but for someone with a moderate risk tolerance, he’ll allocate 25% of the equities’ portion to non-U.S. companies.\nDon’t Lock Me Up Some advisors are turning cautious on private credit after its popularity for the past few years. Recent headlines such as First Brands’ sudden bankruptcy have some market-watchers concerned that underwriting standards may have slipped as the market has grown rapidly. Jason Blackwell, chief investment strategist at Focus Partners Wealth, said the issues with private credit are likely idiosyncratic and not pervasive, but it’s another reminder that diversification and manager selection matter.\n\n“The golden era may not be over, but it is unlikely to be a free ride from here,” he said.\nAlthough Harris emphasizes broad portfolio diversification, he said he shies away from alternatives in general, whether private equity, private credit or hedge funds. There are many reasons why he doesn’t incorporate alternatives, but the biggest is the long lockups. “We think it’s the rare retail investor who should be locking up any of their money,” he said.\n‘Tax the Season. Two macroeconomic phenomena could affect markets in 2026, Blackwell said. First, the benefits of the new tax law passed by Congress in the summer should hit taxpayers’ bank accounts during the 2025 tax filing season. Consensus estimates suggest people may receive more than $50 billion in refunds. “That is a 44% increase over 2025 and could give consumption a timely boost in the first quarter,” he said.\n\nOn the flip side, he notes that midterm elections are in 2026, and historically, the second year of a four-term presidential term has delivered the deepest market correction. There is plenty to worry about, including taxes, spending, trade policy and AI regulation, but he points out that history shows that recoveries following these corrections are just as robust. “Long-term investors who can see through the political fog have usually been well rewarded,” he said.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "How Investors May Respond To Meta Platforms (META) Massive AI Buildout, Clean Energy Push, And Leadership Shifts\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nIn recent weeks Meta Platforms has doubled down on artificial intelligence, unveiling new Mango and Avocado models targeted for 2026, ramping AI data‑center and clean‑energy projects backed by a very large US$30.00 billion bond deal, while also seeing governance shifts with board member Dina Powell McCormick resigning and AI chief Yann LeCun planning his exit.\nAt the same time, Meta’s AI ambitions are extending from superintelligence labs and massive Louisiana “Hyperion” infrastructure financing to real‑world deployments such as ACES Pest Control’s use of Meta smart glasses and NextEra‑supported clean energy contracts that underpin Meta’s push to match operations with 100% clean power.\nWe’ll now examine how Meta’s accelerated AI infrastructure build‑out, including the US$27.00 billion Hyperion data center financing, reshapes its long‑term investment narrative.\n\nThe best AI stocks today may lie beyond giants like Nvidia and Microsoft. Find the next big opportunity with these 24 smaller AI-focused companies with strong growth potential through early-stage innovation in machine learning, automation, and data intelligence that could fund your retirement.\nMeta Platforms Investment Narrative Recap To own Meta today, you have to believe that its massive AI and data center spend will keep reinforcing its core advertising engine faster than costs erode margins, while Reality Labs and long term AI bets remain optional upside rather than a drag. The recent US$30.00 billion bond deal and US$27.00 billion Hyperion financing crystallize the key near term catalyst and risk in one move: AI driven engagement and ad growth versus capital intensity and free cash flow pressure. So far, Dina Powell McCormick’s resignation and Yann LeCun’s planned exit do not materially change that balance.\n\nAmong the latest announcements, Meta’s roughly 2.5 GW in clean energy contracts with NextEra stands out because it directly supports the power needs of this AI build out while aligning with the company’s aim to match operations with 100% clean energy. For investors, it ties together two central threads of the Meta story right now: the scale of AI infrastructure being put in place and the parallel effort to manage long term regulatory and ESG scrutiny that could influence how profitably that infrastructure is used.\nYet behind Meta’s AI acceleration and clean power push, investors should still be aware of...\nRead the full narrative on Meta Platforms (it's free!)\nMeta Platforms' narrative projects $275.9 billion revenue and $92.1 billion earnings by 2028.\n\nStory Continues\nUncover how Meta Platforms' forecasts yield a $841.42 fair value , a 28% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Across 88 fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community, views on Meta’s worth span roughly US$540 to just over US$900, underscoring how differently investors frame the same facts. Many of these individual models sit against a backdrop of heavy AI driven capital expenditure that could either support sustained revenue growth or pressure future profitability, so it is worth comparing several of these viewpoints side by side.\n\nExplore 88 other fair value estimates on Meta Platforms - why the stock might be worth 18% less than the current price!\nBuild Your Own Meta Platforms Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has 18% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 Trillion-Dollar AI Stocks. Wall Street Says They Can Soar in 2026.\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve user engagement and advertising outcomes across its social media networks.\nMicrosoft has added generative artificial intelligence features (Copilots) to many of its software products, and its data center footprint is expanding rapidly.\nAmazon is leaning on artificial intelligence to makes its e-commerce business more profitable and to increase cloud computing sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, a hedge fund that outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points over the last three years. That makes him an excellent source of inspiration.\nLaffont had nearly 18% of his portfolio invested in three artificial intelligence stocks (each worth well over $1 trillion) as of the third quarter: 7.3% in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , 5.9% in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and 4.7% in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . He clearly has a great deal of confidence in those companies, and Wall Street anticipates substantial upside in all three stocks in the next year.\nHere are the important details.\nMeta Platforms: 28% upside implied by the median target price Meta has a strong presence in two industries: digital advertising and smart glasses. It owns three of the four most popular social media networks , which lets it collect user data and target media content. That advantage has made Meta the second-largest adtech company in the world. But the company also dominates the nascent smart glasses market.\n\nMeta is using artificial intelligence (AI) -- from custom chips to proprietary large language models -- to improve user engagement and advertising conversions across its portfolio of industry-leading social media. It is also developing a superintelligence system to integrate with its smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says glasses will be our \"primary computing devices\" in the future.\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look quite reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842 per share. That implies 28% upside from its current share price of $658.\nMicrosoft: 30% upside implied by the median target price Microsoft has a strong competitive position in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. It is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for its office productivity suite Microsoft 365, its portfolio also includes popular applications for business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning. Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft is monetizing AI across its software and cloud businesses. CEO Satya Nadella says customers are adopting Microsoft 365 Copilot (a generative AI assistant) faster than any new product. Additionally, its entire family of Copilot applications topped 150 million monthly active users in the quarter ended in September, up from 100 million in the quarter ended in June.\n\nMicrosoft Azure has gained about 3 percentage points of market share since the AI boom started, despite compute capacity constraints. However, the company is building out its data center capacity faster than any other cloud provider, according to Satya Nadella. Azure plans to double its data center footprint in the next two years.\nWall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to increase at 14% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look somewhat expensive, though investors eager to own the stock could still buy a small position today. Among 62 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 30% upside from its current share price of $485.\nAmazon: 32% upside implied by the median target price Amazon has a strong competitive position in three industries: e-commerce, advertising, and cloud computing. It runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company dominates retail media, one of the fastest-growing verticals in the broader digital advertising market. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nIn retail, Amazon has built an artificial intelligence shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales in 2025. Shoppers who engage the conversational chatbot are 60% more likely to make a purchase. Amazon has also developed generative AI tools that improve inventory placement, robot productivity, and last-mile delivery.\nMeanwhile, AWS is introducing artificial intelligence features at a rapid clip. In the last few months, the company added tools to Bedrock AgentCore that help developers build and deploy generative AI agents. AWS also added agents for software development, security fixes, and performance monitoring. And it expanded its portfolio of pre-trained models.\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 73 analysts, Amazon has a median target price of $300 per share.

      "Content": "Is Meta Stock a Buy Headed Into 2026?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 5:23 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta's revenue growth rates have been accelerating.\nThe company is investing heavily in AI, and its spending next year will likely be even more extreme.\nThe stock is no longer cheap. But it's not expensive either.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock has lagged in 2025. Shares of the Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads parent are up about 13% for the year, while the S&P 500 has climbed about 17%.\n\nThe gap looks odd given how the business has performed. The company has kept pushing faster growth out of its ad platform across its social media properties -- and it has continued to invest aggressively in AI (artificial intelligence) . If that spending does what management hopes, 2026 could be the year the stock rerates higher.\nOn the other hand, the same investment plan that could power the next leg of growth also raises the stock's risk profile. Any slowdown in revenue growth rates next year could derail investor confidence in Meta's plan to invest aggressively in long-term growth opportunities.\nStrong business momentum 2025 has been a standout year for the social media company 's business.\nMeta's second-quarter revenue rose an impressive 22%. This was a significant acceleration from 16% growth in Q1. But Meta didn't stop there. The third quarter pushed that pace to 26%, with quarterly revenue reaching more than $51 billion.\n\nThis growth was fueled by impressive advertising performance. In Q3, Meta's ad impressions rose 14% year over year. Additionally, average price per ad increased 10%.\nAnd it looks like the company will likely wrap up the year on a high note. For the fourth quarter of 2025, Meta expects revenue to be between $56 billion and $59 billion. The midpoint of this guidance range implies 19% growth. But the high end would translate to 22% growth. Both of these figures are well ahead of the 16% growth the company started the year with.\nMeta's biggest risk The biggest risk for the stock is not hard to name. Meta is building an enormous amount of AI capacity, and the bill is rising quickly. The company told investors it expects 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to come in at $70 billion to $72 billion.\nThen it raised the bar for 2026. Meta chief financial officer Susan Li said in Meta's third-quarter update that the company expects \"capital expenditures dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025.\"\nShe also warned that total expenses should grow faster in 2026, driven mainly by infrastructure costs, including higher depreciation and cloud spend.\n\nStory Continues\nThis investment plan can work. Meta ended the third quarter with about $44.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Additionally, it generated $10.6 billion of free cash flow (cash from regular operations less capital expenditures), even as its capital expenditures ramped up. And the company still managed to return cash to shareholders in the quarter. Specifically, it spent about $3.2 billion on repurchases and $1.3 billion on dividends.\n\nBut given the company's expectations for continued growth in capital expenditures, free cash flow will likely come down next year and possibly even turn negative, requiring the company to tap into its massive cash hoard.\nSo, given this combination of powerful business momentum and soaring spending, is Meta a buy going into 2026? With a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, the stock isn't cheap. But it may be worth paying up for. The stock's performance will likely boil down to whether Meta's big spending helps the company sustain its rapid top-line growth rates next year -- and given Meta's long history of strong execution, I think this is plausible.\nWhile I ultimately like the stock headed into 2026, investors should keep in mind the risks and watch the company closely. In addition, any position in the stock should probably be kept small. Any signs that Meta's AI spending isn't going to help the business materially could be a reason to revisit the bull case.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Be Worth More Than $2 Trillion by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Tesla is operating in a difficult environment.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are providing computing units for the AI build-out.\nMeta Platforms' stock was slammed due to spending plans.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nThere are currently five stocks that have a valuation of $2 trillion or more. Outside of these five, only a handful of others are in a position to be worth $2 trillion or more in 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nThe next largest company is Berkshire Hathaway , which has a market cap of about $1 trillion. For that stock to double would be a huge feat, especially without Warren Buffett at the helm, so let's put it aside.\nNow we're left with Meta, Tesla, Broadcom, and TSMC. Which of these will make it to $2 trillion by the end of 2026?\nAll will beat the market if they reach $2 trillion by 2026 The largest is Meta Platforms, sitting at a $1.66 trillion valuation. The smallest is Taiwan Semiconductor at $1.49 billion. That places all four of these stocks in relatively close proximity to each other, which means the required return is fairly similar. Meta would need to rise 21% while Taiwan Semiconductor must rise 34%. Both of these potential performance figures would indicate a market-beating stock, so if any of these companies can breach the $2 trillion threshold, they will likely be great to own.\nThe $2 trillion threshold is also uncharted territory for this group. Both Meta and Broadcom have come close, but neither has crossed into the $2 trillion zone.\nI think three will make it, while one will be left out If you sort the companies by growth rates, it's clear that there's one outlier: Tesla.\nIt's no secret that Tesla is struggling in the current environment, due to electric vehicle (EV) credits ending from the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the other three are posting incredible growth rates that don't look to be slowing down anytime soon in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips in the artificial intelligence supply chain. Without its production capabilities, none of the AI computing power we know now would be possible. Demand for AI chips isn't slowing down, and Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to continue growing at a rapid 21% pace in 2026, according to Wall Street analysts. However, these analysts have consistently underestimated Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the past few years, so don't be surprised if TSMC outperforms these expectations. Couple that with the second-cheapest valuation in this group, and Taiwan Semiconductor should reach the $2 trillion mark in 2026.\n\nStory continues\nMeta Platforms nearly entered the $2 trillion club, but pulled back following a poorly received third-quarter earnings report. While the business's performance was incredible, investors didn't like Meta's massive spending plans. There is growing concern that Meta is overextending itself, which is why investors have started selling off the stock. However, I think Meta is just the first company to max out its cash flows being devoted to AI computing capacity, and it won't be the last. The market will come back around to Meta's stock in 2026 and will send it back to levels allowing it to reach the $2 trillion point.\n\nLast is Broadcom, which also sold off due to 2026 guidance. Wall Street wanted greater visibility into faster AI growth, and Broadcom told investors they needed to be patient. Still, Broadcom informed investors that its Q4 AI revenue was $6.5 billion, up 74% year over year, and that it projects Q1's growth to be north of 100%. Broadcom is a much larger business than just AI, and the business isn't nearly as successful in those endeavors. Still, I think sustained growth from its custom AI computing units will drive Broadcom's stock higher in 2026, allowing it to reach the $2 trillion threshold.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "TikTok's future uncertain after US joint venture deal, says analyst\n\nReuters Videos\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 10:58 AM PST\n\nIn this video: ORCL\n\nMETA\n\nSTORY: The deal to hand control of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a group of investors, including Oracle, marked a major turning point after years of uncertainty over the future of the popular video app. But former Peking University business professor Jeffrey Towson says it raises new questions about the new entity’s ability to compete. \"It's not obvious what happens with this company going forward because you just went from a global platform to a regional one, but your competitors are still global. Their primary competitors are YouTube and Facebook, Instagram reels. Well, if they're separate, then they are dramatically smaller than the global giants, which was not the case last month. So that has some interesting, sort of, business strategy and competition questions that get raised.\" The deal is aimed at avoiding a U.S. ban of the short video app, which is used regularly by more than 170 million Americans. It comes after a yearslong saga to force TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its U.S. operation, which began in August 2020, when President Donald Trump first tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over U.S. national security concerns. Financial terms of the deal, announced in an internal memo by TikTok (U.S.) seen by Reuters, were not disclosed. The White House said in September the new joint venture would operate TikTok's U.S. app, but questions remain about the deal, including the business relationships between the new joint venture and ByteDance… which will still own about 20% of the U.S. company. Sources told Reuters in September that ByteDance would also own a separate division that would control the revenue-generating business operations such as e-commerce and advertising. Those arrangements formed the deal framework announced on Thursday, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday. \"The big question is still, is Chinese government going to approve this? Because they've never actually said that they would. The Trump administration has said its been approved by them, but we've never actually heard anything from the Chinese government formally. Now, who knows what's going on behind closed doors? In theory, that could happen quite quickly or it could emerge as a problem. I suspect it's probably not a problem, but we don't actually know the other major party at the table in terms of the decision making here.\" Oracle will own the majority of the joint venture along with private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Shares of Oracle rose as much as 8% in Friday morning trading.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "ByteDance Is Quietly Printing $50 Billion--and Might Soon Rival Meta\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:49 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nORCL\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nPeople familiar with the matter have indicated that ByteDance could be heading toward a standout profit year, with the TikTok parent on track for roughly $50 billion in profit in 2025 after generating about $40 billion in net income over the first three quarters. The figures suggest the company has already moved past its own internal targets, potentially putting its earnings trajectory close to that of Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ:META ), which is projected to earn about $60 billion this year. While ByteDance has not disclosed updated revenue figures, it had previously aimed for about a 20% increase in 2025 sales to $186 billion, a level that would leave it just below Meta's projected revenue base.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs ORCL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThis financial progress is unfolding alongside ongoing regulatory pressure in the US, where the Biden administration has sought to restrict TikTok on national security grounds. According to an internal memo, TikTok chief executive Shou Chew told employees that ByteDance has signed binding agreements to form a new US joint venture that would be majority-owned by American investors, including Oracle Corp. ( NYSE:ORCL ). Chinese regulatory approval remains outstanding, which could influence the final outcome, but the move appears designed to preserve TikTok's US operations while reducing direct Chinese control. A ByteDance spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nOperationally, the burden of growth has increasingly shifted toward TikTok as Douyin faces softer consumption and advertising trends in China. TikTok has continued to expand globally, pushing into e-commerce and livestream shopping and partnering with companies such as Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), while also stepping up its cultural presence with events like its first TikTok Awards in Los Angeles. Investors have responded with rising valuation marks, with SoftBank's Vision Fund previously valuing ByteDance at above $400 billion and later transactions implying levels as high as $480 billion. Even as growth could moderate compared with earlier years, ByteDance's scale, expanding international reach, and ambitions in artificial intelligence suggest its earnings and strategic direction will remain closely watched.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why is Truth Social owner Trump Media merging with a fusion energy firm?\n\nLauren Aratani in New York\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:42 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group, owner of Donald Trump ’s social media platform, Truth Social, announced a merger on Wednesday with a company developing fusion energy technology.\nTAE Technologies, an energy company founded in 1998, will join with Trump Media via a $6bn merger that it promises will propel it to build “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant” next year.\n\nThe move signals that the president and his family continue to look for profit-seeking ventures outside of Truth Social, which remains tiny compared to rival platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter).\nHere is what we know about the deal so far.\nWhat did Trump Media announce? The media company, which has dabbled in financial services, is engineering a huge pivot and diving headfirst into nuclear energy.\nRelated: Trump Media announces $6bn merger plan with fusion power company\nTrump Media has “built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans”, according to its CEO, Devin Nunes. “And now we’re taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.”\n\nNunes, a former congressman, is set to serve as co-CEO of the new company with Michl Binderbauer, TAE’s CEO. Shareholders of each firm will own about 50% of the combined company. The company will be overseen by a nine-member board of directors, which will include Trump.\nTrump Media has also agreed to give TAE $300m in cash to continue developing its fusion energy technology.\nThe deal comes amid soaring demand for new energy sources that can feed artificial intelligence and the massive datacenters that power it . While this deal is a big bet on fusion power meeting that demand, a commercially viable reactor has never been built.\nSo is Trump Media still a social media company? Kind of. Trump launched the company in 2021 to be a competitor to the big tech companies that had kicked him off their platforms at the time, including Facebook and Twitter. But Truth Social has only a few million active users, a speck compared with the larger platforms.\nThough Truth Social went public on the stock market as part of Trump Media in 2024, the wider firm has been racking up losses: $54.8m in the three months to 30 September, more than double those incurred during the same period of 2024.\n\nShares of the company soared when Trump was re-elected for a second term, but they are down almost 60% since the start of the year.\nThe merger with TAE, while seemingly out of left field, is on track with the company’s attempts to diversify Trump Media’s assets beyond Truth Social. In recent years, it built out a massive, volatile cryptocurrency treasury and tried to create new financial products and betting markets .\n\nStory Continues\nWhat exactly is fusion energy? TAE is one of a handful of companies that is working on developing fusion energy , a type of nuclear energy that mimics the power of the sun to produce energy.\nWhile a type of nuclear energy, fusion energy is different from the nuclear energy that was developed in the 1940s, which was created through fission. Fission energy was created by splitting atoms, whereas fusion energy creates energy by forcing atoms together.\n\nThe technology is still in its early stages, and some scientists are skeptical that it can be produced at a commercial scale.\nBut demand for clean, safe energy has skyrocketed with the AI revolution, which has put enormous amounts of pressure on the energy grid. This is why tech companies and AI leaders such as Google parent company Alphabet and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have been investing in fusion energy companies including TAE and Helion Energy, which are trying to commercialize fusion energy.\nWait, why is this deal happening? The move by the Trump family business into the fusion energy space comes amid steps by the Trump White House to bolster the technology.\nRelated: ‘We wanted to take action’: US toy company fights back over Trump tariffs\nSince entering office in January, the US president has made moves to deregulate the nuclear energy industry and accelerate technology development, including signing executive orders that deem developing new technology as an issue of national security.\n\nTrump’s Department of Energy has especially been focused on the new technology, with the creation of a new Office of Fusion whose goal is to get fusion technology ready for commercial use as quickly as possible.\nAfter the merger, TAE said it will start construction on a utility-scale fusion power plant that it hopes will generate power for commercial use by 2031. In an interview with CNN , TAE’s Binderbauer said more capital will mean the company can build its plant more quickly.\n“The velocity [at which] you can get the capital is differentiating. If I raise $2bn over five years, I can’t build the plant sufficiently fast,” Binderbauer said. “Sometimes you get lucky and you meet the right people.”\nDan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, noted that TAE will probably get “major political support from President Trump” because of the deal, though Binderbauer told CNN that he welcomes regulatory scrutiny.\n“I’m not looking for anything special,” Binderbauer said. “Perhaps you get more scrutinized from a regulatory perspective and that’s good because it will give the world confidence that technology is what matters.”\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Opening Bid with Brian Sozzi to talk about his expectations for the Magnificent Seven and the broader AI trade.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat is the future of the AI trade and how are you playing it next year? Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AppLovin's Margin Engine Fuels its Accelerating Momentum\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:21 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: APP\n\nAppLovin ’s APP most recent results underscore a company whose performance is increasingly driven by extraordinary margin strength, highlighting a business model built for operating leverage and efficiency.\nIts profitability profile now stands well above typical industry benchmarks, with third-quarter 2025 results offering a clear view of how powerful its operating structure has become. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 82% illustrates AppLovin’s exceptional ability to translate incremental revenue into profit, reinforcing margins as the central force behind its continued momentum.\n\nThis margin strength is rooted in APP’s cost-light infrastructure and automated ad-delivery ecosystem. The company benefits from a structurally lower reliance on human-driven creative processes, shifting more of its workflow into genAI-based optimization. Leadership highlighted that generative AI is reshaping creative development, onboarding, and recommendation systems, reducing manual overhead while improving ad performance. This technology-first approach allows AppLovin to gain operating leverage as revenue scales, and recent results validate the strategy.\nThe third quarter showcased this dynamic clearly: revenues increased 68% year over year, yet adjusted EBITDA rose 79%. Net income surged 92%, reflecting how efficiently the company transforms growth into profitability.\n\nPeer View: Meta and The Trade Desk Meta Platforms META is doubling down on its AI-driven Advantage+ campaigns to maintain dominance amid AppLovin’s Axon push.

      "Content": "AI hyperscalers have room for ‘elevated debt issuance’ — even after their recent bond binge, BofA says\n\nJason Ma\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BAC\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThe tech giants fueling the AI boom generate so much cash relative to their debt that they have more than enough room to issue more, according to Bank of America .\nIn a note this week, analysts looked at the top five publicly traded AI hyperscalers: Meta , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Oracle .\nBofA pointed out that while the companies can fund their near-term capital expenditures with cash, they are tapping debt markets for balance-sheet flexibility and better cost of capital. Last month alone, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon raised tens of billions of dollars in the bond market.\n\nOperating cash flow for the big five hyperscalers is expected to hit $577 billion this year from $378 billion in 2023, while debt should climb from $356 billion to $433 billion.\nThat means their overall debt burden is actually getting lighter as the debt-to-cash ratio should dip from 0.94 to 0.75.\n“Given the hyperscalers’ historically conservative capital allocation and balance sheet policies, elevated debt issuance is possible, as evident by the recent bond deals from Meta, Alphabet and Amazon,” BofA said.\nAnd plenty of additional cash is on the way. By 2029, operating cash flow is seen jumping 95% to $1.1 trillion, while capex is forecast to grow at a much slower pace of 58% to $632 billion.\nBut then there’s Oracle. Unlike the other AI hyperscalers, it will have negative free cash flow until 2029, meaning its capex will exceed cash from operations, according to BofA. As a result, it doesn’t have much capacity to take on more debt.\n\nIndeed, fears about Oracle’s debt binge have rattled the overall AI stock trade as the company isn’t a cash machine like its AI peers.\nRecent earnings guidance was also weak, and the company raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 capex by another $15 billion. In addition, surging lease obligations have spooked Wall Street.\nA Financial Times report on Wednesday that said alternative investments firm Blue Owl didn’t team up with Oracle on a data center after all piled on more concerns. Shares fell on the news, though the company’s development partner, Related Digital, said Blue Owl was outbid on the project and didn’t back out of it.\nBut even though debt may not pose a limit on hyperscalers’ ambitions, they still face physical limits , namely in building enough infrastructure fast enough to meet demand.\nData-center researcher Jonathan Koomey told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg that capital can be deployed instantly, but the equipment that capital must buy cannot. Tmelines for turbines, transformers, specialized cooling systems, and high-voltage gear have stretched into years, he explained.\n\nStory Continues\n“This happens every time there’s a massive shift in investment,” Koomey added. “Eventually manufacturers catch up, but not right away. Reality intervenes.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meta is strengthening its AI product offering by releasing the models in the first half of 2026. During an internal conference, Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang claimed Mango would generate visuals and movies, while Avocado believed to be Meta's Llama language model successor will improve code. He noted that the business is investigating world models, AI that simulates and predicts real-world events.The claim followed Meta's former top AI scientist Yann LeCun's departure to create a world model firm. Wang joined Meta this year after Meta spent roughly $15 billion in Scale AI, demonstrating its commitment to next-generation AI research.Due to competition from OpenAI and Anthropic, Meta revamped their AI division to speed up research and delivery. Some executives pondered switching from Llama to competing models before recommitting to in-house innovation, according to reports.The next releases of Mango and Avocado are anticipated to help Meta extend its AI-driven content and productivity features across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Together, these capabilities are intended to enable more precise interrogation of disease biology and higher-confidence advancement of CNS drug candidates.\n\n\"Therapeutic progress in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases has been constrained by four fundamental challenges: crossing the blood–brain barrier, entering the neuron, releasing the drug into the cytoplasm while avoiding endosomal degradation, and targeting the intracellular pathways that drive disease,\" said Bruce McCormick, Chief Executive Officer of Mercury Bio. \"Our focus at Mercury Bio is on advancing therapeutics that address those intracellular mechanisms. The yEV technology supports that goal, and Meta-Flux adds the biological intelligence needed to ensure we are targeting the right pathways with confidence.\"\nMeta-Flux's platform integrates multi-omics data and disease-scale simulations to model how neuronal pathways respond to therapeutic intervention, enabling more informed program design and biomarker strategies in direct support of Mercury Bio's CNS therapeutics.\n\n\"This partnership allows us to evaluate disease mechanisms and therapeutic hypotheses in a context that has historically been inaccessible,\" said Lee Sherlock, Chief Executive Officer of Meta-Flux. \"By applying our modeling framework to Mercury Bio's CNS programs, we can help strengthen the biological rationale behind advancing large-molecule therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease.\"\n\nStory Continues\nThe collaboration reflects a shared commitment to building a more disciplined, data-driven approach to advancing therapeutics for diseases of the brain.\nContact:\nKaelie Barnard | Director of Marketing, Barson Corp.\n406694@email4pr.com | 516-712-6050\nMeta-Flux | Corporate Communications 406694@email4pr.com\nView original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mercury-bio-and-meta-flux-announce-strategic-collaboration-to-advance-large-molecule-therapeutics-for-parkinsons-and-alzheimers-diseases-302646691.html\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily ESG Dive newsletter .\nDive Brief: Frontier &mdash; the decarbonization initiative backed by Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, McKinsey and others &mdash; announced on Thursday it had facilitated a $44.2 million carbon offtake agreement for its buyers with Canadian company Nulife GreenTech.\nNulife&rsquo;s carbon removal process uses biowaste as a feedstock to produce a concentrated bio-oil and biochar that can then be stored underground in salt caverns. Under the agreement, the company will remove 122,000 tons of carbon dioxide for Frontier&rsquo;s buyers between 2026-2030, Frontier said in a blog post .\nThe offtake purchases were facilitated for Stripe, Google, Shopify, H&M and other Frontier members, according to the post. Frontier also has a partnership with sustainability platform Watershed, which allowed additional companies, including Canva and Skims, to participate in the offtake, the post said.\n\nDive Insight: Frontier said its buyers were Nulife&rsquo;s first customers in 2024 in a prepurchase agreement, according to Thursday&rsquo;s announcement. Nulife has so far delivered 407 tons of removals as part of that prepurchase, according to Frontier&rsquo;s portfolio page . Frontier and its buyers have also previously invested in other bio-waste removal companies, including a $58.3 million deal with startup Vaulted Deep in 2024.\n\nNulife&rsquo;s carbon removal process utilizes hydrothermal liquefaction, converting biomass waste from facilities like food processors, municipal waste facilities and paper mills into a carbon-rich oil. Nulife touts a patented hydrothermal liquefaction process, but the conversion process typically involves turning a feedstock into an oil through chemical reactions that take place in hot, compressed water, according to the American Chemical Society .\nIn a Thursday press release , Nulife called the deal a &ldquo;significant vote of confidence&rdquo; in the company&rsquo;s platform and &ldquo;real-world waste management value.&rdquo; Nulife Co-founder Jerry Kristian said the deal gives the company &ldquo;the long-term demand signal&rdquo; needed to scale its biomass removal and storage platform.\n\nThe deal will allow Nulife &ldquo;to deliver permanent carbon removal while helping communities and commercial operators &mdash; including agricultural processors, industrial facilities, and municipal operators &mdash; manage organic waste more sustainably and cost-effectively,&rdquo; Kristian said in the press release.\n\nStory Continues\nFrontier estimated in its blog post that the volume of carbon removal through the hydrothermal liquefaction process &ldquo;could reach 1.5 gigatons of CO2 removal per year by 2040.&rdquo;\nOther Frontier members involved in the offtakes include McKinsey Sustainability &mdash; a founding partner of the initiative &mdash; engineering design firm Autodesk and enterprise HR software platform Workday. Online dating service company Match Group, independent primary care network Aledade, vehicle fleet management platform Samsara, flight comparison company Skyscanner, fintech Wise and software-as-a-service firm Zendesk also participated through Frontier and Watershed&rsquo;s partnership, according to the blog.\n\nFrontier reports a decarbonization portfolio that includes over $713 million in offtake agreements and 1,886,898 tons of contracted CO2 removals, including $261 million and 688,300 tons of contracted removals since December 2024. Frontier has backed 52 total carbon removal projects, and Nulife and Vaulted Deep are among 13 biomass carbon removal and storage projects that the initiative has backed, according to its portfolio.\nRecommended Reading\nFrontier signs $58.3M deal with bio-waste carbon removal startup Vaulted Deep\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: AMD ) is one of the Buzzing AI Stocks on Wall Street. On December 15, Piper Sandler reiterated an “Overweight” rating on the stock with a $280.00 price target.\nThe rating affirmation follows the firm’s pre-quiet period call with AMD, with analysts citing several key AI catalysts working in favor of the stock.\nAMD elaborated that it is allocating a significant amount of resources toward the Helios rack, which is anticipated to launch in the middle of next year.

      "Content": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company May Now Be Winning the AI War\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:52 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After ChatGPT took some of its search traffic, Alphabet rebounded by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode.\nAlphabet's Gemini 3 is considered a leading LLM.\nManagement will increase the tech giant's capital expenditures in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIt's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world in significant ways, and the major hyperscalers are all investing hundreds of billions of dollars in their efforts to capitalize on the trend. Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Meta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n\nLuke Juricic\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:49 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is readying a technological offensive for 2026, developing a suite of next-generation artificial intelligence models designed to challenge the dominance of OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.\nAccording to the Thursday report from WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter, the social media giant is working on a high-stakes image and video-focused AI model code-named \"Mango.\" Concurrently, the company is developing \"Avocado,\" its next major text-based large language model (LLM).\n\nThe new roadmap was reportedly detailed during an internal Q&A on Thursday featuring Meta’s Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox. The models are expected to release in the first half of 2026, signaling a long-term play to move beyond the incremental updates of the current Llama family.\nThe development of Mango and Avocado represents the first major output from Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a specialized division created after a major restructuring this past summer. To lead the group, CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally orchestrated high-profile recruiting efforts, poaching more than 20 researchers from OpenAI and hiring Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, to oversee the effort.\nThe move underscores Zuckerberg’s willingness to spend aggressively to close the gap with rivals. As part of the transition, Meta reportedly invested over $14 billion to acquire a near-majority stake in Scale AI, cementing Wang’s role as the primary architect of Meta’s post-Llama strategy.\n\nDuring the internal session, Wang emphasized that Avocado will focus heavily on advanced coding capabilities, a traditional weak point for previous Meta models compared to competitors.\nMore ambitiously, Wang noted that Meta is in the early stages of developing \"world models.\" Unlike current LLMs that predict the next word in a sequence, world models aim to understand physical reality by processing vast amounts of visual information.\nMeta stock remained relatively flat in after-hours trade following the WSJ report, though shares rose 2.3% during trading hours.\nRelated articles\nMeta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta Platforms (META) Laps the Stock Market: Here's Why\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nMeta Platforms (META) closed the most recent trading day at $664.45, moving +2.3% from the previous trading session.

The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $8.15, signifying a 1.62% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $58.37 billion, indicating a 20.63% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $23.43 per share and revenue of $198.75 billion. These totals would mark changes of -1.8% and +20.82%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

By outperforming established approaches from Meta, DeepMind-affiliated researchers, and Harvard, Corti's new Gradient Interaction Modification (GIM) technique proves that specialized labs can lead in fundamental AI research - the kind that shapes how the entire industry builds, understands, and deploys intelligent systems\nThe \"surgical\" shift\nAs models aspire to reach AGI-level complexity, the industry is realizing the need to sharpen comprehension - we cannot control what we cannot see. The focus is shifting from simply scaling parameters to understanding the mechanisms behind them.\n\n\"Until now, much of AI development has been empirical rather than mechanistic - we train models and observe results, but struggle to understand why they work,\" said Lars Maaløe, Co-Founder and CTO at Corti . \"GIM reveals the internal logic that standard tools miss, turning model improvement from trial-and-error into precision engineering.\"\nThe technical breakthrough\nTraditional interpretability methods test neurons in isolation - like testing light switches one at a time. However, if the light only turns off when all switches are flipped, testing them individually falsely suggests that neither switch matters.\nGIM solves this by analyzing how components interact when changed simultaneously, revealing the actual circuits driving behavior rather than backup mechanisms. This enables researchers to:\n\nPinpoint Causality: Identify the specific circuits responsible for outputs, not just correlated signals.\nDebug Surgically: Trace failures like hallucinations to their root cause.\nScale Efficiently: Run deep analysis on production models in seconds - critical for meeting regulatory requirements like the EU AI Act (Article 13) .\nHigher standards for the highest stakes\nHealthcare AI demands higher explainability standards than consumer applications. When models influence clinical decisions, institutions need forensic-level precision to trace reasoning and validate safety - not just aggregate accuracy.\n\nStory Continues\n\"In healthcare, we don't have the luxury of 'good enough' - we need to know exactly why a model made a specific decision,\" said Andreas Cleve, Co-Founder and CEO of Corti . \"High-stakes verticals require surgical precision. We built GIM because we needed it for our own clinical infrastructure, but the result is a tool that accelerates progress for the entire field.\"\n\nThis addresses a problem that's becoming universal. As transparency requirements expand across finance, autonomous systems, and government services, the methods necessary for clinical deployment today are becoming table stakes for all regulated AI tomorrow.\nCorti has released GIM as open source, making the method immediately available to researchers, developers, and organizations worldwide. Developers can access the implementation through a Python package here .\nAbout Corti\nCorti is a research and development company that specializes in state-of-the-art AI foundation models and infrastructure for healthcare. Its mission is to eliminate administrative hurdles in healthcare and life sciences and to bring expert-level reasoning to every corner of the globe - driving down costs and improving quality of care through purpose-built AI models you can trust.\nCorti's models integrate seamlessly into any healthcare application through Corti's SDKs and APIs, enabling vendors, providers, and payers to leverage safe, cutting-edge AI across the entire care journey.\nwww.corti.ai\nCONTACT: press@corti.ai\nView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/corti-unlocks-surgical-ai-improvement-outperforming-big-tech-in-interpretability-benchmark-302646275.html\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company\n\nSamantha Dorisca\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nDarrell Spencer is shattering various glass ceilings.\nThe Chicago native credits his hustling nature to his parents. His mother works as a postmaster for the United States Postal Service. His father worked for the Chicago Police Department and rose through the ranks to become a commander before retiring. His father also has a real estate portfolio, which was an additional stream of revenue for the family and was an early sign for Spencer that there are other financial paths to follow outside the confines of corporate America.\n\nWorking In Big Tech After completing a bachelor’s in economics at Connecticut College on a full-tuition national scholarship, Spencer got a job in finance but later pivoted into big tech. He has worked at Facebook, Google, Pinterest, and LinkedIn within their customer sales department in advertising, he told AFROTECH. Still, he felt called to entrepreneurship.\n“I helped them generate millions of dollars in revenue through a strategy across each different platform at each company that I was at,” he shared. “Did really well there. However, I just didn’t feel fulfilled. I woke up every day feeling just like it was routine. And it got to a point where I was very dissatisfied with the trajectory of my life. I felt as if there was more in life that I had to do. And growing up, I’ve always known that I wanted to do something in business … I just never knew what I wanted to do, but I’ve always known I wanted to create.”\n\nLeap Into Entrepreneurship In 2021, Spencer’s first swing as a founder was with Kings Crowning, which offered a satin-lined cap that was a functional, stylish, alternative bonnet for men. The business launched from a storage unit and grew into a multimillion-dollar company, leading him to become a first-generation CEO and millionaire by the time he was 27 years old, per Business Insider.\n\nCrowned Skin Fast forward to March 2024, and Spencer is on to his next brainchild, Crowned Skin, a science-backed skincare and grooming brand for men. The inspiration for the company came from a place of frustration while walking down retail aisles, seeing little representation and few innovative products for men in these categories, he told AFROTECH\n.\nSpencer made an upfront investment of between $10,000 and $15,000 into Crowned Skin with the income generated from King’s Crowning, coupled with real estate investments. These funds were recouped within a few months, he recalled. The investment gave him the financial freedom to create products, establish warehousing, and fund advertising.\n“I just wanted to create products that made men feel seen and confident,” Spencer explained. “I think men across the board, there’s this stigma when it comes down to men’s beauty, men’s grooming. It’s this hush topic that men don’t feel comfortable talking about.”\n\nStory Continues\nCrowned Skin offers body butter, cologne, and body oil in a range of scents, including its newest scent, Empire.\nSpencer has been intentional with growing the company to be profitable and self-sustaining. Strategic decisions, such as pivoting early in Crowned Skin’s marketing messaging, have helped him guide the company towards those goals. Working at various big tech companies as an ads manager allowed him to understand the power of attention and how to retain it.\n\nThis knowledge influenced how the brand positioned its products. Spencer showed the functionality of the products, which include ultra-moisturizing and healing properties; aligned with what would resonate with men, such as the allure of certain scents; and demonstrated the products’ efficiency, as they could cut morning routines in half by functioning as a two-in-one product.\n“We ended up running with those street marketing pieces. And then we learned that through creative messaging, through compelling five- to ten-second ad content around that messaging, that’s what really compelled. That’s what really propelled the business forward very, very fast,” he acknowledged.\n“So then at that point, we were getting our revenue shot up. The business was funding itself. We were very profitable. We were mindful of our return on ad spend, and we were able to scale up as more funds came in. And the next thing we knew, at that point, we really didn’t need any outside investments,” he added. “We didn’t need any other injections of capital … We chose to scale intentionally and scale when revenue came in.”\n\nRevenue Crowned Skin earned $4 million in revenue within its first year and is now a multi-million-dollar company, Spencer confirmed to AFROTECH\n. This feat is aided by strong teams across financial, fulfillment, product development, and manufacturing. Additionally, e-commerce has remained a major component of Crowned Skin’s success through Amazon and TikTok Shop, which have particularly helped boost revenue for the venture.\n“If you want to be a highly competitive and successful brand and company in today’s age, you need to diversify, be on every e-commerce channel across the board, and be your best at all of them. TikTok Shop has been huge. TikTok shop is becoming one of our biggest revenue channels. And the way that you can work with affiliates and really seed samples and fuel your company through affiliates, but also the age of live selling on TikTok, we’re coming into a whole new age of e-commerce marketing,” Spencer explained.\nTikTok Shop has become a six-figure-a-month channel for the company. Crowned Skin also makes history as the first Black male-founded skincare company to reach the #2 spot on TikTok Shop, according to information shared with AFROTECH\n.\n“I get to really be a forward-thinking leader in this space as a Black man in an underrepresented category where there’s not many other Black males doing this … This all was self-taught … Representation is everything for me because I think there’s so many other Black men out there that are in that similar position, but honestly, fear might stunt them. I’m really proud that I get to really create this amazing company and showcase all that you can do as a Black man. If you truly put your head down, it really works,” Spencer explained.\n\nFirst Retail Partnership The overarching goal is to position Crowned Skin as a one-stop shop for men’s grooming. There are currently various products in research and development, including body washes and deodorants, Spencer told AFROTECH\n. It will also soon gain greater visibility following its first-ever retail partnership with Walmart.com. There are plans to later expand regionally, then nationally on store shelves, Spencer shared.\nSpencer also stated that he intends to raise a Series A, likely in 2026, to scale the company globally.\n\n“I want Crowned Skin to be around for years and years, and I want it to last even when I’m not here. I want this to be a legacy company … I want global access … That’ll be an amazing opportunity for us to scale to even more heights, bring on an amazing partner or partners right in this space that have done it, that have scaled companies to nine, 10 figures, and that can really position Crowned Skin to be one of the most dominating forces in men’s grooming,” he expressed.\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Trump Media shares surged 37% following the announcement.\nTrump Media operates Truth Social with an estimated user base in the low millions compared to Meta Platforms ‘ billions and X’s hundreds of millions.\nTAE Technologies plans to begin construction on its first commercial fusion plant in 2026 despite no operating fusion plants globally producing net energy for the grid.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group ( NASDAQ:DJT ) -- owner of President Trump's Truth Social platform -- announced a shocking, all-stock merger agreement this morning with privately held nuclear fusion company TAE Technologies in a deal valuing the combined businesses at more than $6 billion. With shareholders of each company expected to own approximately 50% of the merged entity, the transaction is expected to close in mid-2026, subject to approvals.\nFollowing the announcement, Trump Media shares are surging 37% in early trading today as the merger aims to create one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies. It would position the combined firm to build utility-scale fusion power plants, with the first one beginning construction next year. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs.\n\nTruth Social's Limited Reach Truth Social was launched in 2022 as an alternative platform emphasizing free expression, but has struggled to achieve broad market traction because of its association with President Trump -- Barron's reports he indirectly owns about 115 million shares of the company. Instead, the app primarily attracts users aligned with his political base, limiting its appeal beyond that demographic.\n\nReports indicate Truth Social has far fewer active users compared to established platforms such as Meta Platforms ' ( NASDAQ:META ) Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- which collectively boast billions of monthly active users worldwide -- and X, which also commands hundreds of millions of users. Truth Social's user base remains significantly smaller, with estimates placing it in the low millions, reflecting challenges in expanding beyond its core audience.\nFusion: Energy's Chimera TAE Technologies was founded in 1998 and has pursued nuclear fusion -- a process mimicking the sun's energy production -- for over 25 years. Fusion is often called the energy industry's holy grail due to its potential for abundant, clean power without long-term radioactive waste, unlike traditional nuclear fission.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has built and operated five experimental reactors, raising more than $1.3 billion from investors, including Google and Chevron ( NYSE:CVX ). The company now plans to advance to utility-scale operations, aiming to commence construction on its first commercial plant in 2026. This step represents a significant escalation from research prototypes to power generation capable of supplying electricity to the grid.\n\nDespite progress, achieving commercial fusion remains elusive globally, with no operating plants producing net energy for the grid. TAE's ambition to deploy utility-scale facilities faces substantial technical and financial challenges. Although the company has demonstrated advancements in reactor design, transitioning to reliable, cost-effective power production is fraught with hurdles.\nKey Takeaways TAE's timeline for a utility-scale plant beginning next year appears highly ambitious, requiring not only technical breakthroughs but also extensive regulatory approvals from bodies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy.\nTrump Media is seeking to leverage growing energy demands from artificial intelligence data centers, where fusion could theoretically provide vast power. However, combining a social media operation with cutting-edge fusion research represents a sharp divergence from core businesses for both entities. It reeks of opportunistic grandstanding by attempting to capitalize on the hot topic of AI's energy demands, much like its previous venture into the crypto world.\n\nGiven fusion's history of overpromising and delay -- and the merger's execution risks -- the deal carries a high probability of complications, setbacks, and failure. Investors should avoid buying into the hype. If TAE and Trump Media can actually succeed in the effort, there will be plenty of opportunity to buy in afterward.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nMatt Hussey,Jason Nelson\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:40 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMETA\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts —self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps , that run without banks, governments, or big tech.\n\nWhen programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain —not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games , digital art , and assets worth billions.\nUltimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.\nThis guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.\nSmart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.\nSmart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.\n\nWho Invented Ethereum? Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.\n\nDevelopment of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nA crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.\n\nThe network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.\nThe switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work\nThis shift, known as “ The Merge ,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.\nBlocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhat applications have been built on Ethereum? 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.\n📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.\n💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.\n💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.\n💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.\n🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.\n\nTimeline: Major milestones in Ethereum Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.\nMid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.\nJuly 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.\nSeptember 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.\nMarch 2016: Homestead upgrade improves protocol security and usability.\nApril 2016: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, launches via crowdsale.\nJune 2016: Hackers exploit The DAO and drain roughly $50 million in Ether. Community votes to hard-fork, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\nOctober 2017: Byzantium hard fork enhances performance, privacy, and sets the stage for Proof-of-Stake.\nDecember 2017: CryptoKitties and CryptoPunk NFTs go viral, stressing network capacity and highlighting scalability issues.\nJanuary 2018: ERC-721 NFT standard is introduced, enabling unique digital assets.\nDecember 2020: Beacon Chain launches, beginning Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake.\nMarch 2020: Visa begins settling USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin transactions using Ethereum.\nApril 2021: Berlin hard fork reduces gas costs.\nAugust 2021: London hard fork activates EIP-1559 ; introduces fee burning, reducing inflation.\nSeptember 15, 2022: “The Merge” transitions Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, cutting energy use by more than 99 percent.\nApril 12, 2023: The Shanghai upgrade enables withdrawal of staked Ether from the Beacon Chain.\nMarch 13, 2024: The Dencun upgrade introduces proto-danksharding, a step toward reducing costs and increasing scalability.\nMay 7, 2025: The Pectra upgrade, combining Prague and Electra updates, aims to expand staking flexibility and improve Ethereum’s efficiency.\nDecember 3, 2025: The Fusaka upgrade introduces changes to Ethereum's data availability and block capacity.\n\nEthereum and DAOs One of Ethereum’s most radical innovations was the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes . Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.\nThe first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack , but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.\n\nWhat Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?\nSince then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon , to investment collectives like Syndicate , and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO , which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.\nSupporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.\nA network tested by crisis If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.\nEthereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.\nThe community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nEthereum and the NFT boom Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.\nThe breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties , CryptoPunks , and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\nBy 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million , and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.\nEthereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nThe race to scale Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.\nTo address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 . The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.\n\nVitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'\nEthereum and the Web3 vision Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.\n\nBut competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana , Cardano , and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.\nEthereum and privacy In 2025, privacy has become a key focus of the Ethereum project. In November, Vitalik Buterin stated that \"Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene,\" building on a narrative in which he framed it as a fundamental requirement for digital systems such as blockchain platforms.\nEthereum Foundation Launches New Cluster Focused on Privacy\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has followed suit, launching a privacy cluster in October 2025 that includes 47 researchers, coordinators and cryptographers. The Foundation also launched Kohaku, a \"privacy-first\" toolkit for Ethereum, alongside a browser wallet and SDK. Upon its launch, Buterin commented that \"Full-stack privacy and security are first-class priorities in Ethereum.\"\nA decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.\nWhat’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

JPMorgan's 2026 outlook, backed by new CEO survey data, suggests markets are now recalibrating expectations — shifting focus from AI adoption to whether it actually delivers profits.\nGenAI Fell Short Of CEO Expectations PwC's latest global CEO survey, covering more than 4,700 executives across 109 countries, shows a clear expectation gap. While over 40% of CEOs entered 2025 expecting GenAI to boost revenue and nearly half anticipated a lift in profitability, only about one-third reported meaningful gains in either metric by year-end. Efficiency improvements were more visible, but even those undershot initial expectations.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nJPMorgan's interpretation isn't that AI spending was misplaced — it's that monetization arrived slower than anticipated. Adoption moved quickly, but translating that into top-line and margin expansion proved harder than forecasts implied.\nFrom Experimentation To ROI Discipline That gap is now changing behavior. JPMorgan notes that boards and CFOs are pressing harder on return on investment, favoring projects with clearer financial outcomes over open-ended experimentation. Growth alone is no longer enough; it needs to come with margin discipline.\nAs a result, valuation frameworks are tightening. Metrics like the Rule of 40 — and JPMorgan's stricter Rule of X — are reasserting themselves as filters rather than afterthoughts.\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nWhy 2026 Will Look Different The implication for 2026 is straightforward.

      "Content": "Charlie Munger Said, 'Find A Way To Get Your Hands On $100,000' Even If It Means Walking Everywhere — The Magic Number If You Want To Be Rich\n\nJeannine Mancini\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nCharlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

Dublin already hosts the European hubs of major technology groups such as Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) and ByteDance's TikTok, and industry observers suggest the current AI boom could reinforce the city's long-standing ties to US technology firms. Anthropic declined to comment on its specific leasing plans but said it is expanding rapidly, with existing European offices in London, Paris, Zurich and Munich, and has described EMEA as its fastest-growing region in a November blog post.\n\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), also declined to discuss specific property plans, but said it employs about 60 people in Ireland and expects to continue adding staff in 2026. The company began its Dublin operations in 2023 and is advertising roles including software engineers and trust and safety analysts, while also planning to increase the size of its London office. Together, these developments suggest that Dublin could see increased activity from AI companies seeking to scale their European operations, even as the pace and final shape of that expansion remain subject to change.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump Media is merging with fusion power company TAE Technologies in $6B+ deal\n\nTim De Chant, Amanda Silberling\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies , a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.\nThe all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.\n\nTMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch , the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”\nTMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.\nTruth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.\n\nTMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.\nBut the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.\nCurrently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion , are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.\n\nIf one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.\n\nOver the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.\nIn the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.\nAfter the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8b941382-ff1c-35a6-a44b-22dba0ec5010/meta-platforms-%28nasdaq%3A-meta%29.html",
      "Content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 18)\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:50 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThis year, one of the better performers among the Magnificent 7 had been Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ: META ). But its third-quarter earnings report raised investor concerns about the company’s massive capital spending on artificial intelligence initiatives. In addition, Meta says it plans to make significant cuts to the budget of its Reality Labs metaverse division in the coming year. The stock is down 13.6% since the quarterly report was released.\n\nStrong quarterly reports earlier this year (despite a tax charge) had lent credence to the claim that Meta would continue to outshine its competitors over the next year. The share price hit an all-time high of $796.25 back in August. Due to the recent pullback, the stock is up 4.9% year over year, underperforming the broader market. Furthermore, the near-term future of the economy is uncertain—just like the markets themselves—and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a controversial figure. Certainly, Zuckerberg's sudden shift to the metaverse and brand name change to Meta Platforms raised a few eyebrows several years ago.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Meta Platforms Inc.’s ( NASDAQ: META ) AI push has been a key driver for the company in 2025, with integrations coming across numerous platforms, which is fueling engagement and increasing ad sales.\nDespite economic cloudiness, Meta announced that its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) estimate increased significantly, much of which will be allocated to AI project development and integration.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNow, the Meta Platforms CEO is shifting the company's focus and riding a powerful, bullish trend. Against this complex backdrop with many moving parts, investors should consider the wide range of Meta stock price targets and formulate a strategy for all possible outcomes. To help, 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis. Let's jump in.\nWhy Invest in Meta Platforms? Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room. Investors should not rely on Meta Platforms' Reality Labs metaverse business to drive the company's near-term future growth. In Q3 2025, Reality Labs generated $470 million in revenue, up from $370 million in revenue in the prior quarter. However, during that same time frame, Reality Labs recorded a loss from operations of $4.43 billion.\n\nFortunately, it appears that the CEO's attention has turned to a different tech field lately. In particular, Zuckerberg seems to expect AI to be Meta Platforms' key driver going forward. AI integrations into Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp could provide an economic moat for Meta Platforms if new features translate to greater user engagement. WhatsApp, in particular, has seen notable growth with more than 3 billion monthly users now.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta's AI focus evidently helped the company succeed in the third quarter of the year despite losses in its metaverse business. Impressively, Meta Platforms grew its revenue 26% year over year to $51.2 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus call for $49.5 billion. Furthermore, excluding a one-time tax charge, the company's earnings per share (EPS) surged 20% to $7.25, easily outpacing the analysts' consensus estimate of $6.74.\n\nThere's no doubt that Zuckerberg is all-in on the AI revolution now. He envisions a future in which AI will be used for \"a lot\" of \"social tasks.\" And he believes it's \"really compelling\" that AI will \"get to know you better and better.\" Some reporters have expressed skepticism of an AI-infused future. Yet, if Meta Platforms can parlay machine learning into profits, investors shouldn't dismiss the growth potential of Meta stock.\nAnother key driver for Meta Platforms is its Threads short-form messaging platform. Granted, Threads is still playing catch-up to the popular X platform, which is owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Still, Threads is making inroads as its monthly active user count grew from 320 million in 2024's fourth quarter to 350 million in Q1 of 2025. That's not at the level of X, which reportedly has more than 580 million monthly active users. Yet, perhaps AI feature integration can make Threads even more competitive with X in the coming quarters.\n\nThe company expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenue to range from $56 billion to $59 billion. That is expected to be driven primarily by ongoing strength in its advertising business, bolstered by the positive impact of AI-driven enhancements to ad targeting and user engagement across its family of apps.\nMeta Platforms as a Stock It is impossible to know how the economy will perform going forward. Similarly, it remains unclear whether Meta Platforms will achieve significant returns on its AI investments. These unknowns will not stop analysts from publishing their Meta stock price predictions, though.\nOppenheimer and Benchmark downgraded the stock following the third-quarter earnings release, citing increased capex concerns. However, BofA Securities has reiterated its Buy rating on the shares, keeping its price target at $900 and affirming long-term confidence in Meta, citing its user base and potential AI integration opportunities. Cantor Fitzgerald also reaffirmed its positive stance by reiterating an Overweight rating and $920 price target. It anticipates that improvements in AI execution will lead to a \"sentiment reversal\" for the company in 2026.\n\nThe aforementioned uncertainties are reflected in the wide range of Wall Street analysts' price targets for Meta Platforms. The Zuckerberg-led firm has a high price target of $1,117.00, a median price target of $837.92, and a low target price of $685.00. However, the consensus recommendation of 67 analysts covering the stock remains to buy shares.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$685.00\n5.5%\nMedian\n$837.92\n29.0%\nHigh\n$1,117.00\n72.0%\n\nMeta Platforms 2025 Outlook Meta Platforms raised its 2025 capex estimate from a range of $66 billion to $72 billion to a range of $70 billion to $72 billion. By now, you can probably guess what Meta Platforms is spending those extra billions on. If you guessed AI, you are correct. More specifically, Meta Platforms' management anticipates \"additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.\"\n\nHence, the multi-billion-dollar question is whether Meta Platforms can effectively leverage its costly AI enhancements. That's difficult to predict. The same goes for the state of the economy, which might not support an increase in ad spending if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate in the remainder of this year.\n24/7 Wall St.'s Meta forecast is a more bullish than the mean forecast, calling for the share price to rise to $935.29 by the end of next year. That implies a run of 44.0%. It is based on the company’s ability to sustain strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency. This should drive its bottom line despite higher capital expenditures for AI objectives.\nUltimately, your price target for Meta Platforms stock should depend on whether you expect the company to take full advantage of ramped-up AI features. If so, then get ready for Meta Platforms stock to eventually head for new all-time highs. However, it may be a bumpy ride along the way.\n\nMeta’s Heavy AI Spending Justified Says Pro. Is He Right?\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided.

What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(META) Boasts Significant Upside Potential Despite Morgan Stanley Price Target Cut\n\nNeha Gupta\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:15 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMS\n\nGOOG\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) is one of billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2026 . On December 11, Morgan Stanley cut its price target of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to $750 from $820 while reiterating an Overweight rating.\nMeta App 3D sign\nThe price cut comes amid concerns that sentiments around the social media networking stock have turned negative. That’s in part because of growing fears about revenue durability, operating expense uncertainty, and issues around the company’s Llama AI model. The shift in sentiment comes amid growing confidence in Alphabet’s prospects, buoyed by the tech giant’s AI initiatives.\n\nDespite the cut, the price target represents a significant upside potential. Additionally, Morgan Stanley insists Meta is one of the few companies that can leverage its data, distribution capabilities, and AI investments to generate long-term value.\nAdditionally, the stock came under pressure after the company detailed plans to develop a closed, monetizable AI model incorporating technology from Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba. Avocado is the proposed AI model slated for release next spring. Meta will reportedly retain control over the closed AI model, marking a significant departure from the open-source model it has championed over the years.\nThe Pivot towards a closed model is part of an effort to address the disappointments associated with Meta’s Llama 4 Open Source model.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a tech giant focused on connecting people through social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), advertising, and building the future of the internet with virtual and augmented reality (Metaverse, Quest headsets, AI), aiming to blend digital and physical worlds for work, play, and connection.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the Top AI and Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. On December 4, analyst John Blackledge of TD Cowen maintained a “Buy” rating on the company’s stock, retaining the price objective of $810.00. The analyst’s rating is backed by a combination of factors highlighting Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s strategic cost management and potential for earnings growth.\nOne of the main reasons is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s plan to significantly reduce its Metaverse-related expenses, which form part of the Reality Labs segment. As per the analyst, such cost reductions are anticipated to be ~30% by 2026, potentially leading to savings of $5 billion – $6 billion. Notably, this move can help partially mitigate the increased spending on AI infrastructure, which happens to be a key area of investment for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Stanley reduced its price objective on the company’s stock to $750.00 from $820.00, while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. While the firm reduced its price objective, it believes that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) happens to be one of the few selected companies that could leverage leading data, distribution capabilities, and AI investments to fuel earnings power and maintain technological leadership.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
