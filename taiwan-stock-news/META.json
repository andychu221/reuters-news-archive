      "Content": "Meta acquires Manus to expand AI agent capabilities\n\nLuke Juricic\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nInvesting.com -- Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has acquired Manus, a leading autonomous general-purpose AI agent company, in a move to integrate advanced agent technology across its products. Financial terms of the deal were not announced.\nManus, which launched its first General AI Agent earlier this year, has already processed more than 147 trillion tokens and created over 80 million virtual computers. The company currently serves millions of users and businesses worldwide.\n\n\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" said Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus.\nMeta plans to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating it into Meta’s product ecosystem, including Meta AI. The acquisition will bring Manus’s technology to Meta’s billions of users and millions of businesses.\nThe Singapore-based Manus has experienced rapid growth, recently announcing it had reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue just eight months after launch, making it reportedly the fastest startup to achieve this milestone globally. The company’s total revenue run rate exceeds $125 million, including usage-based and other revenue.\n\nThis acquisition comes during what has been described as an intense year for Meta, involving an AI overhaul under CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company has been restructuring to regain ground in the AI race while reportedly developing new AI models like Mango and Avocado for 2026.\nEarlier in 2025, Meta formed Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a dedicated division headquartered in Menlo Park, California, focused on building advanced AI models that integrate deeply into Meta’s ecosystem. The division is lead by Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, a data-labelling startup Meta bought a 49% stake in for $14 billion, effectively acquiring Wang’s services.\nManus will continue to operate from Singapore following the acquisition.\nMeta has not yet responded to Investing.com’s request for comment.\nRelated articles\nMeta acquires Manus to expand AI agent capabilities\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Buy Stock in the Mag 7 Hyperscalers or Are They Spending Too Much?\n\nShaun Pruitt\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAlthough they are among the world’s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\nThis includes Amazon AMZN , Alphabet GOOGL , Meta Platforms META , and Microsoft MSFT , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\n\nThere is no doubt that “hyperscaling” is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns Notably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billion.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nROIC Comparison With Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market’s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\nAmazon’s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance Magnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon’s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon’s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\n\nStory Continues\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts Amazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500’s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Down 40%, This Growth Stock Could Be Set for a Recovery in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:20 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points Shares of Oracle are down big from the all-time high they reached in August.\nOracle's AI spending could be viewed as reckless or a bold bet worth taking.\nOptimists about Oracle's new direction should view the stock as attractive.\n10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›\nShares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) , the database and cloud computing specialist, have kept pace with the S&P 500 in 2025 -- up 17% year to date at the time of this writing, compared to a 17.5% gain in the index. But the tech giant's stock is down about 40% from its all-time high (made in August of this year).\n\nIn hindsight, Oracle's stock probably ran up too far, too fast in a short period, driven by exuberance for its cloud computing deals with OpenAI , Meta Platforms , and other notable companies. But the sell-off is overblown.\nHere's what investors are getting wrong about Oracle and why the stock is a great buy for 2026.\nOracle's divisive transformation Financial markets often struggle to price companies undergoing a transformation. After all, investor expectations stem from what a company does and what it is expected to do in the coming years. And if a company is doing something completely different, there's more uncertainty, which can lead to volatility.\n\nEnter Oracle, a legacy database services company looking to become a cloud computing titan with the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet 's owned Google Cloud.\nOracle's legacy software business is a stable cash cow. But Oracle doesn't generate nearly enough cash flow to cover the massive capital expenditures (capex) needed for building AI infrastructure. So it has turned to the debt markets to fund its massive expansion, which is needed to fulfill $523 billion of remaining performance obligations (RPO).\nThe capex-to-revenue metric shows the relative size of a company's spending within the context of its revenue. Just a few years ago, the major hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon had roughly 0.1 to 0.15 capex-to-revenue ratios, meaning they were raking in around 7 to 10 times more revenue than they were spending on capex. Those ratios have increased as hyperscalers ramp up their spending on artificial intelligence (AI). But Oracle is on another level -- with a capex-to-revenue ratio at a sky-high 0.58.\nOracle is spending so much on AI that its free cash flow (FCF) has turned negative. And that has a lot of investors worried that Oracle is taking an unnecessary gamble on AI. Oracle's credit risk has increased, and it could face a downgrade by ratings agencies to the lower bound of investment grade or possibly even just outside investment grade.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Oracle did mention multiple times on its Dec. 10 earnings call that it is committed to maintaining its investment-grade rating. These fears are arguably already reflected in the stock price. And investors are overlooking the most critical detail about Oracle's debt load: the timeline.\nAn end in sight for Oracle's cash burn Oracle is now more than halfway through building 72 multicloud data centers that embed its database services into third-party clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle expects Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue to ramp up substantially in fiscal 2028, which overlaps with calendar year 2027, as the bulk of its data centers will come online. This is also the time period when Oracle's five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI begins.\nOracle Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Ken Bond said the following when discussing Oracle's negative $10 billion in second-quarter fiscal 2026 FCF on its Dec. 10 earnings call:\nIn sum, Oracle is in the midst of a temporary boom in capex that should soon translate to FCF. It's not a company in a burgeoning industry bleeding cash in the hopes that it can turn profitable down the line.\nTherefore, the biggest risk to Oracle isn't necessarily its debt load or the timeline for converting capex to FCF to pay off debt, but rather, if its customers actually come through on their commitments to pay for OCI services.\n\nOpenAI's $300 billion deal is massive, even within the context of Oracle's $523 billion in RPO. However, even if OpenAI retracts some of that commitment or spreads it out over a longer period, I still believe Oracle will have no shortage of customers to redirect that capacity.\nOracle is a top AI growth stock to buy in the new year Oracle's stock price could be volatile until it proves to investors that it can convert AI capex into FCF. Right now, OpenAI is playing a major role in that narrative because it is potentially Oracle's largest customer. But Oracle doesn't need OpenAI to succeed.\nOracle's data centers are purpose-built for high-performance computing. Its multicloud data centers reduce latency and costs and boost performance by embedding database services within third-party clouds rather than moving large data sets across clouds. So, OCI can be more cost-effective and achieve better performance than its peers.\n\nWith that advantage in mind, it stands to reason that Oracle should be able to win business from other hyperscalers, possibly even OpenAI's top competitors, such as Anthropic, the company behind the Claude AI assistant and large language models.\nWith Oracle stock trading at a26.6 forward price-to-earnings ratio, the market seems to have already digested Oracle's risks, but it is downplaying its potential -- especially the speed at which Oracle could begin paying down debt with FCF. All told, Oracle stands out as a high-conviction growth stock to buy for 2026, but only for risk-tolerant investors who can withstand high volatility.\nShould you buy stock in Oracle right now?

      "Content": "Creator Capital Markets: How Pump.fun Changed Streaming in 2025\n\nRyan Gladwin\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:01 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: PUMP36507-USD\n\nSOL-USD\n\nMETA\n\nThis time last year, the Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun had disabled its livestreaming feature after creators flooded the platform with videos of dangerous stunts in attempts to pump their tokens.\nNow, Pump.fun views streamers as the future of its platform, with plans to take on other livestreaming competitors head on: “Our plan is to kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana,” the company posted on X in July.\n\nThe move is being billed as “ creator capital markets ”—the idea that viewers can help fund their favorite creators while having a stake in the future of their content via a crypto token. It’s a stark contrast from the traditional model, which mostly relies on viewers donating money to creators, with little to nothing in return.\nPump.fun turbocharged this vision when it revamped its fee structure in September to feed more of the fees it generates from each trade to token creators’ pockets. This resulted in some streamers earning tens of thousands of dollars over just a couple days as their content went viral.\nBut the initial momentum soon crashed back down to reality as it became clear that creators and traders made the most money when they leaned into crazy stunts. And Pump.fun found itself back where it started, with a model that incentivizes creators to walk the line of controversy. Now the industry is reflecting on how to change that.\n\nLivestreams return On April 4 , Pump.fun rolled out its updated streaming feature to 5% of its users with revamped user guidelines and a bolstered moderation system. It then slowly expanded the feature to more users, making sure it didn’t get out of control as it did in 2024.\nTwo months later, crypto influencer Jake “ SolJakey ” Hillhouse launched Basedd House , a content crew full of up-and-coming influencers living together in a frat-like house with weekly episodes and meme coins attached to each character. It’s from this that now-established creators made their name, like the wacky Iseem and crypto rapper Whish . Pump.fun directly funded the whole venture, Hillhouse previously told Decrypt .\n\nOther creators and viral moments started to bubble up around them in June, too.\nLeland King Fawcette became the second-fastest person to race through all 50 U.S. states , according to Fifty States Club , all while livestreaming on Pump.fun. A Ukrainian man called Ricken said the words “Pump fun” one million times on stream. And one man even livestreamed the birth of his child , and then named her “Solana”—after the crypto network that hosts the meme coin machine.\nIt was clear that Pump.fun had tapped into something with its audience, and it was then that the company began investing in what it now saw as the future of the platform.\n\nStory Continues\nPump.fun invests Pump.fun started paying people to post clips of the launchpad’s top creators, the opposite of traditional livestreaming platforms, which require their creators to source, manage, and pay these “clippers.” Pump.fun co-founder Alon Cohen told Decrypt this was a bet on “stimulating social activity” in the hopes of incentivizing more adoption of crypto-native livestreaming.\n\nBut it was in September, when Pump.fun revamped its fee model to increase the earnings of creators on the platform tenfold, that streaming started to explode. On one day in September, Pump.fun handed out over $4 million in creator fees, according to Dune data. This meant that streamers, who create their own meme coins attached to each viral (they hope) event, no longer had to sell their own supply of these tokens to make good money.\nPump.fun then doubled down on its livestreaming bet. It began shipping out streamer backpack kits to help creators boost the quality of their streams. The launchpad also hired an unknown number of recruiters, who helped Pump.fun offer contracts to traditional content creators.\nAlec Strasmore , a former assistant to musician Post Malone , was one of these recruiters. Stasmore told Decrypt in September that he would approach content creators in the traditional space who had big audiences but were struggling to monetize effectively, and introduce them to Pump.fun and help onboard them.\n\nThe exact terms of these streamer contracts remain undisclosed. A source familiar with these deals, however, told Decrypt that the contracts included commitments to streaming time, token supply control, and were usually short-term—weeks and months, rather than years. This helped prompt a stream of well-known influencers outside of crypto to join the platform.\nChad Tepper, a former member of Jake Paul’s influencer crew Team 10, who has millions of followers across social media , was one of those who joined Pump.fun. Others, like retired League of Legends esports player Michael “ BunnyFuFuu ” Kurylo, also joined the platform.\nUsually, these tokens would debut with an immediate surge in price, as the content creators' audience bought into the token. More often than not, though, it didn’t last—the hype would eventually fade and the tokens would then slowly trend downwards.\n\nThese scenarios resulted in streamers making big bags during the first few days of trading (BunnyFuFu made over $130,000 in fees in his first three days), before their fees tapered off as trading volume plummeted. (BunnyFuFu only made $29,000 in the three months following). The short shelf life didn’t just hurt creators—traders and viewers also made less money over time.\nAnd, as a result, many of these traditional streamers and creators have since stopped streaming on Pump.fun.\nFormer Pump.fun Dev Sentenced to Six Years in Prison for $2 Million Solana Fraud\n“A lot of those didn't work out. Maybe the best course of action is to not go spend a shit ton of money on Web2 streamers,” Hillhouse told Decrypt , referring to streamers outside of the crypto or “Web3” space. “But you do get those few that matter, that now become a proof of concept,” he said, pointing to Misfits boxer B Dave and TikTok influencer Minikon as shining examples. Both creators ’ tokens are down over 90% from highs set shortly after launch.\n\n“Moving forward, I don’t think [Pump.fun] should be doing that again,” Hillhouse said, suggesting any future deals need to be “more long-term.”\nVirality matters But Pump.fun’s biggest success stories this year came from its homegrown talent: Hillhouse’s Basedd House, the random degens looking to break world records on the site , and the Bagwork boys.\nIn September, two dudes, Chris and Mike, created a token called Bagwork and then livestreamed various stunts to work those bags. The first stunt was relatively mild, running onto the field during a baseball game. They then went mega viral after filming themselves stealing gym influencer Bradley Martyn’s hat and getting slapped for it. The Bagwork token surged 2,000% as a result, netting the duo $49,000 in fees. All it took was just one viral video.\n\nJust days later, the pair leaked unreleased songs from rapper Drake, which brought the Bagwork brand international recognition—and legal trouble, in the form of an apparent cease and desist notice. This stunt earned the Bagwork boys $83,000 in fees over just two days.\nBut the token fell victim to the same ailment that many meme coins before it suffered: once the attention, hype, and controversy fade, so does the price. Bagwork is currently down 96% from its all-time high market cap of $53.8 million, back during the Drake leaks, and now sits at $1.9 million, according to DEX Screener .\nIn an interview with Decrypt , Mike from Bagwork called that period “the best few days of my life.” He thought he was about to turn into one of the “biggest and richest” streamers in the world. As the attention waned, though, he realized there is “definitely a little bit of an issue” with Pump.fun streamers “needing crazier content to pump their tokens.”\n\nSolana Dev Hospitalized With Third Degree Burns Trying to Pump Meme Coin\nHillhouse agreed that something isn’t right with the current model. He suggested more community activations that require tokens, such as voting on what a creator does on stream.\nPump.fun did not respond to Decrypt ’s request for comment on how the company plans to address this tension.\nIt may be make or break for creator capital markets in the coming year. Will Pump.fun find a way to fix its reliance on sensationalist viral moments? Or will creator capital markets fade into obscurity, like the many meme coin trends before it?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2025 was the year AI got a vibe check\n\nRebecca Bellan\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nSCAI.PVT\n\nMoney was no object for the AI industry in early 2025. A vibe check crept in the second half of the year.\nOpenAI raised $40 billion at a $300 billion valuation. Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machine Labs raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech.\n\nSuch astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta shelled out nearly $15 billion to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending.\nThe first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace.\nThe era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment?\n\nWe’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself.\nHow the year started The biggest AI labs got bigger this year.\nIn 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a Softbank-led $40 billion round at a $300 billion post-money valuation. The company also reportedly has investors like Amazon orbiting with compute-tied circular deals, and is in talks to raise $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation . That would bring OpenAI close to the $1 trillion valuation it is reportedly seeking in an IPO next year.\n\nOpenAI rival Anthropic also closed $16.5 billion this year across two rounds, its most recent raise pushed its valuation to $183 billion with heavy hitters like Iconiq Capital, Fidelity, and the Qatar Investment Authority participating. (CEO Dario Amodei confessed to staff in a leaked memo that he was “not thrilled” about taking money from dictatorial Gulf states).\nThen there’s Elon Musk’s xAI, which raised at least $10 billion this year after acquiring X , the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk also owns.\nWe’ve also seen smaller, new startups get a hypey boost from froth-mouthed investors.\n\nStory Continues\nFormer OpenAI chief technologist Mira Murati’s startup Thinking Machine Labs secured a $2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation despite sharing almost no information about its product offering. Vibe-coding startup Lovable’s $200 million Series A earned it a unicorn horn just eight months after launching; this month, Lovable raised another $330 million at a nearly $7 billion post-money valuation. And we can’t leave out AI recruiting startup Mercor, which raised $450 million this year across two rounds, the latest bringing its valuation up to $10 billion .\n\nThese absurdly large valuations are still happening even against the backdrop of still-modest enterprise adoption figures and serious infrastructure constraints, heightening fears of an AI bubble.\nBuild, baby, build For the larger firms, those numbers aren’t coming from nowhere. Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure.\nThe result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding with Nvidia . In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage.\n\nSome of the biggest deals this year powering the infrastructure boom were:\nBut cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently pulled out of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be.\nWhether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers – including calls from figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders to rein in data center expansion – are already slowing projects in some regions.\nEven as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype.\nThe expectation reset In 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout .\nWhile it was meaningful on paper, it didn’t land with the same punch as earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific.\n\nEven Gemini 3 , which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI – which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous ‘code red’ memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance.\nThere was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of R1, its “reasoning” model that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost.\nFrom model breakthroughs to business models As the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows?\nThat shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to sell them hyper-personalized ads . Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI , a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay.\n\nMore than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own Comet browser with agentic capabilities and paying Snap $400 million to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels.\nOpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own Atlas browser and other consumer-facing features like Pulse , while also courting enterprises and developers by launching apps inside ChatGPT itself.\nGoogle, for its part, is leaning on incumbency . On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like Google Calendar , while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting MCP connectors to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge.\n\nIn a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat.\nThe trust and safety vibe check AI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025. More than 50 copyright lawsuits wound through the courts, while reports of “AI psychosis” – the result of chatbots reinforcing delusions and allegedly contributing to multiple suicides and other life-threatening episodes – sparked calls for trust and safety reforms.\n\nWhile some copyright battles met their end – like Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement to authors – most are still unresolved. Though the conversation appears to be shifting from resistance against using copyrighted content for training, to demands for compensation (See: New York Times sues Perplexity for copyright infringement ).\nMeanwhile, mental health concerns around AI chatbot interactions – and their sycophantic responses – emerged as a serious public health issue following multiple deaths by suicide and life-threatening delusions in teens and adults after prolonged chatbot usage. The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots .\n\nPerhaps most telling: the calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects.\nIndustry leaders have warned against chatbots “ juicing engagement ,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional over-reliance on ChatGPT.\nEven the labs themselves started sounding alarms. Anthropic’s May safety report documented Claude Opus 4 attempting to blackmail engineers to prevent its own shutdown. The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy.\nLooking ahead If 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value.\nThe era of ‘trust us, the returns will come’ is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia.

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nEllie Diamond\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: FIG\n\nSTLA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAAPL\n\nThere are countless articles and profiles of entrepreneurs who dropped out of college. Fortune magazine recently featured several, including Figma CEO Dylan Field and Scale founder Lucy Guo, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire woman, who built her own fortune.\nInnovators like these young people make the news because they’re inspiring, intelligent and innovative. They’re also exceptional. which can make them unrealistic role models, according to Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from experience before striking out on their own.\n\nThe Exception, Not the Rule In October 2025, two entrepreneurs took the stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin. One was John Elkann, the chair and executive director of automaking giant Stellantis [ 3 ]. During his interview with Bezos, Elkann asked what he thought of the ideal of the prodigy entrepreneur.\nThese are personalities such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Steve Jobs. Each became hugely successful after rejecting the conventional pathway to success: a college education and years of climbing the ladder .\n\nElkann didn’t take this route, and neither did Bezos. They have great respect for those who did, but Bezos is quick to point out that it shouldn’t be an expectation.\n“It is possible to be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur ,” he said. “We have famous examples of that. But these people are the exception.”\nThe numbers back him up. A Clifford-Lewis Private Wealth study found that among the top 0.1% of rapidly growing new businesses, the founder’s average age was 45 at startup. Based on its data, Clifford-Lewis estimates that entrepreneurs have a much higher chance of success at 30 than at 20.\nSee Next: I Asked ChatGPT How To Build Wealth for the Rest of Trump’s Term: Here’s Its Plan\nTrending Now: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\n\nThe Value of Professional Experience Bezos started Amazon at age 30. He had graduated from Princeton University in 1986 and worked at several Wall Street companies, including Fitel and Bankers Trust. In 1990, he became the youngest-ever vice president of hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He opened Amazon in July 1995 at age 31.\nBezos said these 10 years of working for others improved Amazon’s chances of success . He gained hands-on experience leading a growing company, and these skills helped him guide Amazon through its early days of explosive growth. In only two years, he took the company public, with an initial public offering price of $18 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nBezos now counsels young aspiring entrepreneurs to follow a similar path. As he said in Turin:\n“I always advise young people, go work at a best-practices company where you can learn a lot of basic, fundamental things: how to hire really well, how to interview, etc. There’s a lot of stuff you would learn in a great company, and there’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it”.\n\nBezos believes that these early career lessons do what pure inspiration and talent cannot: They teach young entrepreneurs how to do things right from day one. This knowledge supports better decision-making, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company, which changed its name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in 2021 to emphasize its focus on building the metaverse, is making massive investments in artificial intelligence and related infrastructure.

Let's take a closer look at why Meta is deserving of the No. 3 ranking on this list of best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026.\nMeta's spending creates upside, not risk Zuckerberg knows that to make money, you have to spend money. And he's never been afraid to do that. Meta Platforms has recorded losses of $73 billion so far on its Reality Labs division, which is charged with building virtual reality and augmented reality hardware and software to support the metaverse.\n\nI confess I never saw the appeal of the metaverse, so I was as relieved as anyone when Zuckerberg finally signaled a long-overdue pivot. According to Bloomberg, Meta is planning deep cuts in its Reality Labs division as the company pivots to developing artificial intelligence. Meta stock rose 4% on Bloomberg's early December report.\nThis time, I think that Zuckerberg is getting it right. Meta already has some massive platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, that have huge followings and tons of engagement. With its Meta AI assistant, the company can deliver personalized content and ads, including those powered by generative AI tools. Meta's Llama large language model enables users to create and interact with AI personas, providing more engagement across its family of apps.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd Meta's AI tools are having an immediate impact on the company's bottom line. Revenue in the third quarter totaled $51.24 billion, up 26% from a year ago. Net income fell from $15.68 billion to $2.70 billion, but that was only because of a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion that was required by the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Meta says excluding the charge, income would have increased to $18.64 billion.\n\nNotably, Meta recorded $50.08 billion in advertising revenue in the quarter, up from $39.88 billion a year ago.\n\"We are at an exciting point for our company, where we have continued runway to improve our core services today as well as the opportunity to build new AI-powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the future,\" management said in the earnings report.\nWhy Meta is No. 3 Meta is investing heavily in AI, with capital expenditures for 2025 expected to range between $70 billion and $72 billion. And that number is expected to increase in 2026, according to Chief Financial Officer Susan Li. But while other companies may struggle with that, Meta's in great shape. It generated $44.8 billion in trailing free cash flow during the third quarter, giving it the resources to invest in AI.\n\nZuckerberg wants Meta's AI spending to lead to \"personal superintelligence,\" which he describes as an AI companion that allows Meta's users to improve their relationships, automate work, encourage creativity, and help them achieve personal goals. That's an achievable goal, because that's how people are starting to use AI already.\nMeta stock is down 13% in the last three months and has been underperforming the S&P 500 for most of the year. But I think the shares are on the verge of a rebound, and are now trading at a discounted price-to-earnings ratio of less than 30. I believe that Meta stock will be a big winner in 2026, and this is an ideal place to buy a Magnificent Seven stock at a discounted price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:49 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nMeta Platforms' AI Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\nMeta Platforms is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META&rsquo;s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META&rsquo;s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms&rsquo; initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company&rsquo;s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet and Amazon , are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space\n\nMeta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\nAlphabet&rsquo;s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon&rsquo;s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nMETA&rsquo;s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\nMeta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 24.6%.\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s 6.62X. META has a Value Score of C.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.16 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, suggesting 1.75% year-over-year growth.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc.

They have made bank in Mac 7. Uh not only this year, the year before and the year before that, maybe even a couple years before. They're they're sitting on a lot of gains is what I'm trying to say. What should they be doing right now with these gains?\n00:14 George\nGood morning, Brian. Can you imagine being a short seller in this market and trying to bet against the the Mag 7 or the AI trade or anything. I mean, you get carried out. Short selling's been like the worst uh possible thesis on the market you could have the last 15 years other than maybe going long oil and gas stocks. So I I I would not bet against any of any of these complexes, any of these movements. You want to talk about earnings growth, this market's got it. A lot of the other developed countries really don't. So betting against the US has been a fool's game and I'm certainly not going to be doing it in 2026. I'm going not I'm be going to not try to time the market. I'm going to try to stay in there, stay positions as is and just trim and reallocate as as wisdom would would dictate.\n01:05 Brian\nGeorge, I just had a a guest on uh I'm doing double duty here. I was in the 9:00 a.m. hour and they were making the case for healthcare. If you had to stack up these two sectors side by side, you got uh AI plays, you got the Mac 7, healthcare. What excites you more and why?\n01:22 George\nYeah, I don't really like any of those the best. I think healthcare's seen a significant rally in the closing parts of 2025. If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer discussed.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s shares are up by 10.7% year-to-date after having dipped by 11% in late October. The stock had its worst day in three years after the firm released its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. While the results saw Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s $51.24 billion in revenue and $7.25 in earnings per share beat analyst estimates, investors were caught off guard by the firm’s capital expenditure guidance. As part of the earnings, management outlined that the firm would spend between $70 billion and $72 billion in 2025, the low end of which was higher than the previous guidance of $66 billion. Cramer had defended the stock after the earnings as he asserted that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was positioning itself to protect against OpenAI’s potential entry into the social media ecosystem. On December 19th, Wedbush cut the firm’s share price target to $880 from $920 and kept an Outperform rating as it commented on margin contraction in 2026. For his part, Cramer continues to be an ardent believer in Meta Platforms, Inc.

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Investing in These 3 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Right Now Could Set You Up for Life\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:57 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nWMT\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms continues to dominate with its social networks while exploring AI glasses, which can become a lucrative revenue stream.\nInteractive Brokers is one of the top beneficiaries of surging interest among investors who want to beat the stock market.\nWalmart's online ads continue to gain momentum and can yield higher profit margins in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Interactive Brokers Group ›\n\nInvesting in high-quality growth stocks and gradually building your positions can turn you into a millionaire investor. It takes a while to achieve that goal, and some people look beyond the S&P 500 index to amplify their returns. These are some of the most promising stocks that can produce appealing long-term returns.\nMeta Platforms is still a top-tier ad platform Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the second-largest advertising stock , only behind Google. However, Facebook's parent company has been reporting higher financial growth rates than Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which gives it an edge for new investors.\nTop-line results continue to expand, based on the company's 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter. Meta Platforms also recently launched its AI glasses, which may turn into a valuable revenue source that diversifies the company's finances in a few years.\n\nSocial media growth remains strong, with the company reporting 3.54 billion daily active users in Q3, which represents an 8% year-over-year increase. Continued demand for Meta Platforms' family of apps will yield more ad impressions and sales.\nInteractive Brokers is riding strong demand from investors When people make more stock trades and use margin to boost their exposure to equities, brokerage firms like Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ: IBKR) come out as the big winners. Shares are up by more than 40% year to date and have more than quadrupled over the past five years. Recent earnings results suggest that the momentum can continue.\n\nInteractive Brokers increased its total revenue by more than 20% year over year in Q3, with commission revenue and net interest income as two of the biggest winners. Strong engagement drove these results, with customer account growth increasing by 32% year over year. Interactive Brokers added 4.13 million accounts while delivering stock and options trading volume gains of 67% and 27% year over year, respectively.\nInvestors are still feeling good about the stock market based on a 39% year-over-year increase in Interactive Brokers' customer margin loans. Strong demand for the stock market should help the brokerage firm continue to outperform the S&P 500 and deliver millionaire-maker returns.\n\nStory Continues\nWalmart's pivot to advertising is a long-term tailwind that will boost margins Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) has made its mark as the world's top retailer and has a real shot at exceeding a $1 trillion market cap in 2026. The company continues to boost sales and delivered 5.8% year-over-year revenue growth for investors in Q3 FY26.\nHowever, the company's advertising segment is addressing one of Walmart's biggest weaknesses. Walmart enjoys high order volumes but struggles with profit margins. The company's net margins usually hover near 3% since retail stocks aren't known for high margins. Ads can be a game changer, especially since Walmart reported 53% year-over-year revenue growth for its global advertising business.\n\nAds don't make up a large portion of Walmart's total business, but they can grow over time and boost margins. In the meantime, Walmart continues to gain market share in retail while expanding its e-commerce sales, which were up by 27% year over year. Each Walmart store acts as a distribution facility, which results in lower shipping costs and quicker deliveries.\nFew companies can compete with Walmart in terms of size, and that works well for investors who want millionaire-maker stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Interactive Brokers Group right now?

At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the Best Quality Stocks to Buy Before 2026 . According to a report by The Wall Street Journal released on December 18, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is set to release two new and significant AI developments in 2026.\n​The company is developing its next large language model called Avocado, along with a new image and video generation AI model called Mango. The chief AI officer of Meta, Alexandr Wang, noted that these models are expected to be launched in the first half of 2026. Moreover, Wang also highlighted that the company is making the next LLM better at coding. In addition, the chief AI officer also pointed out that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is in the early stages of developing World Models, which are AI models that learn about their environment through visual inputs.\n​That said, on December 18, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was reiterated with a Buy rating and a $810 price target by Bank of America. The firm noted the company’s 2026 expense guidance and its LLM launch planned for the first half of 2026 as major catalysts behind the bullish sentiment. For long-term investors, BofA suggests that they should follow the company’s returns from heavy AI spending across core apps, ad monetization, and new ventures.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is focused on developing AI-powered social platforms and immersive technologies, including Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Beloved specialty clothing store closing after 49 years\n\nDaniel Kline\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:07 AM PST 4 min read\n\nRunning a family business for 50 years requires a lot of sacrifice.\nI grew up in a family business, Lynn Ladder & Scaffolding, which has actually existed for longer than that. When it's your family's business, there's little separation between work hours and off hours.\nAs a kid, I remember late nights when the alarm went off at corporate headquarters, and my father had to go meet the police in order to figure out what happened. When I got older and spent four years working for the business, I experienced early mornings bringing product to job sites to keep customers happy, and I learned that mixing family and business has its challenges.\n\nTo make any family business last nearly 50 years, you have to have a passion for it, and that's something Ronnie Sylvester, known as “Mr. Boot” in the Country and Western industry, had for Western clothing.\nHis store, Sylvester's Western Wear, served locals from its Louisiana store and was a regional destination as well as a tourist attraction. Sylvester ran the store until he passed away in 2020 following a battle with Parkinson’s disease.\nHis wife, Lisa Sylvester, has operated the business since.\n“My husband worked so very hard. He’s a legend. I wanted to carry on for him, but now it’s time in my life that I put my family first,” Lisa Sylvester told Fox 8 Live .\nThe store will close for good on January 5.\nChanging customer patterns hurt Sylvester's Western Wear Lisa Sylvester told Fox that shifting shopping habits have affected longtime local businesses like hers.\n“It sure does affect the local businesses that have been here for many many years,” she said. “You know it’s the way the world’s turning.”\n\"Worldwide, e-commerce retail sales will reach an estimated $6.42 trillion in 2025, representing 20.5% of all retail commerce,\" according to e-commerce data from Capital One .\n\nThe report showed the impact of online shopping, which has hit chains like Sylvester's Western Wear, which has a very limited website without an e-commerce business, especially hard.\nOver 2.77 billion people worldwide shop online.\nProjections indicate that value will increase to $8.91 trillion in 2030.\nBusiness-to-business (B2B) e-commerce spending will total $62.2 trillion by 2030.\neCommerce sales in 2025 will be up 6.86% from total e-commerce retail sales in 2024 ( $6.01 trillion ).\nU.S. retail e-commerce sales for 2025 are expected to total $1.47 trillion , up 9.78% from 2024 ($1.34 trillion).\nSylvester's Western Wear hinted at a closure While the shutdown plans were not made official until after Christmas, Lisa Sylvester has hinted at some coming changes in a pre-holiday Facebook post.\n\"One shop for continued savings! Again, thank you for your love and support through our 50 beautiful years. Can't wait to see what the future holds! Merry merry Christmas to everyone! Thank you,\" she wrote.\n\nThe store offered discounts as much as 50% during the Christmas season, which certainly suggested its owner was thinking about closing.\nMore Retail:\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\nE-commerce sales have been growing, and research shows that big players like Amazon and Walmart, which operate out of distribution centers, do impact local retailers.\n\"Establishment of an e-commerce fulfillment center reduces retail employment growth in the host county by an average of almost 1,000 jobs per quarter,\" the National Bureau of Economic Research reported .\nLocal stores closing hit communities hard The loss of a locally-owned store has deep impact on a community.\n\"In one week, 91% of American consumers shop at small and local stores, including over 122 million household shoppers,\" another Capital One study showed .\n68% or $68 out of every $100 spent at local stores remains in the local economy.\nAmerican shoppers spent an estimated $3.74 trillion at local stores in 2024, equivalent to 51.5% of all retail sales.\n8.67% of American small businesses are retailers ( 3.01 million out of 34.8 million total small businesses).\n\nA quick look at Sylvester's Western Wear's history Founded in 1976: Sylvester’s Western Wear operated from Kenner, Louisiana, for decades as a local staple in western apparel and boots, according to Manta .\nSylvester’s Western Wear operated at 2600 Williams Blvd. in Kenner, LA , selling boots, western apparel, and accessories to locals and visitors for decades, according to the Chamber of Commerce .\nCommunity staple with strong in‑store reputation: In recent years, many customers praised the store’s personalized service, wide selection, and friendly staff, contrasting with big‑box alternatives, according to Sylvester's Western Wear .\nDecember 2025 closure after decades: The family‑owned store closed its doors after decades in business, with local news noting its significance to the community as a longtime retail fixture, according to Fox 8 Live .\n\nSylvester’s Western Wear was more than just a place to buy boots and belts.

      "Content": "I'm an 83-year-old yoga instructor. I'm not your typical grandma — I still work to feel fulfilled and supplement my Social Security.\n\nNoah Sheidlower\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 6 min read\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Barbara Brown, 83, who works as a yoga instructor in Richmond, Virginia. Brown said her work has been fulfilling, given that many of her classes are at nursing homes . Though she needs to work to supplement her Social Security , Brown said she has no intention of retiring. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started working after school at the age of 15 and have been working ever since. My family wasn't well-off and needed help, so I took it upon myself to attend college at night and work all day.\nWhile I was in school, a gentleman from JPMorgan recruited me to work for the company. I began my career as an auditor after earning my degree in accounting.\nI spent over 15 years at JPMorgan, and it was a wonderful experience, but it wasn't easy. I then worked at smaller companies as a controller, overseeing accounting operations. I also worked for entertainment companies and startups in New York.\nBusiness Insider's \"80-over-80\" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. If you are 80 and older and still work, fill out this form to contribute to the series.\n\nRead our capstone story from the series and watch our video .\nI moved to Richmond about 20 years ago. My husband got sick and had a stroke, so we moved here because my son was going to college here. Richmond is very different from New York, but I found a job at a visual arts place, where I stayed for about 10 years until 2009.\nAfter retiring from that job, I became a yoga instructor, and I'm still running my business full-time at age 83.\nI've always done yoga I did so especially when I worked on Wall Street to keep my nerves together. In Richmond, I started doing a lot of yoga while I was working, and it came to a point where I thought I'd like to be a teacher, as I was getting older.\nI took my vacation time and spent two weeks at an ashram. I returned six months later to complete my training.\n\nI earned my first certification as a 200-hour yoga teacher and got a job at the Y, where I taught a class during my lunch hour in 2009. I then retired from my full-time job. I distinctly remember my last day, when I boxed everything up and then went to teach my yoga class . I never really stopped working.\nI would travel to cafés to teach seniors, and I taught at studios. I made it my business to teach everywhere and continue to study.\n\nStory Continues\nI led yoga retreats, taking people overseas to countries like Costa Rica and Guatemala. I would teach twice a day, and we would have vegetarian meals. I did that for seven years, in addition to my regular teaching.\nNow, I'm concentrating on teaching at nursing homes I have five nursing homes that I travel to, and I'm grateful because it's a great experience for me, as a person over 80 , to be in the shape I'm in. I visit several places where people experience memory loss, so I have developed a technique to teach them.\nThey love music, so I go in with a drum and get them singing. It's fascinating that people with memory loss often recognize familiar tunes. I can give them a laugh, and even with some loss, they can benefit from yoga.\n\nI teach chair yoga, so I don't have to get down on a mat. I can sit in the chair and demo to the class what needs to be done. I still privately teach one person on the mat who comes to my house.\nThere's a woman who never moves, and they put her in my class, and I looked over and saw her moving her hands and feet. It's a truly rewarding experience to see that I'm making a positive impact on people's lives.\nI can also work with young people — I can work with anybody. It's just that I couldn't work with young people constantly because I'd have to be on the mat, and that would be too much for my body, so this works for me.\nI'm not like the average yoga teacher. I've handled all the finances for my business and haven't asked anyone for help. I hope to continue teaching for as long as possible.\n\nI'm also a vegan, and I follow a very strict diet I've been vegan for over 35 years. It isn't very expensive to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, and I don't eat a lot. Seeing so many people in the conditions that they're in, many of whom are younger than me, I wish a lot of them would eat a better diet.\nI don't take any medications. At my last physical, I was told my vital statistics put me at age 40. I don't feel old. When I went to the chiropractor, one of the staff members asked me how old I was. I said, I'm not going to tell you, because then you put me in a range.\n\nI'm not working just for the money because I really love it, but I need the money to help me financially I work to supplement my Social Security , which would not be enough on its own.\nI bought a house to rent out, but when COVID-19 broke out, the renters didn't pay me for seven months. I'm still paying back my credit cards. I also have a mortgage on my own home.\nBecoming a yoga teacher is also extremely expensive. I could have never done it now. It costs around $10,000 to start, and then you have to keep up with ongoing learning. Even yoga clothes are expensive, and it's a very upscale activity.\n\nI have a son and three grandkids My schedule is so busy that I'm not a typical grandmother. I'm not baking cookies and cooking for my grandkids, though I do see them often. Once I finish teaching, I rest, because it is a lot of energy, especially for an older body. I do some breath work when I come home.\nEverybody has had challenges of all kinds. Losing my husband and my mother was very hard. I stay in the moment, not looking back or regretting. My time is spent creating. What can I do now to create a better life and to help others have a better life?\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The increase represents a “relatively more attractive risk/reward profile” for the company.\nBCE’s dividend has been “derisked with reasonable FCF payout ratios,” according to BMO Capital, easing a major worry for investors in the high-yield telecom industry.

(NYSE:BCE) also performed well in the third quarter of 2025, thanks to strategic acquisitions and collaborations. The company’s total revenue climbed by 1.3%, mainly due to the acquisition of Ziply Fiber. In addition, its adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.5% while maintaining a good margin of 45.7%.

      "Content": "Financially independent investors swear by this overlooked passive-income stream. Here’s why some call it ‘easy’ money\n\nJessica Wong\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nPassive income is more than Airbnb side hustles and dividend stocks . There’s another moneymaker that’s earning savvy investors money on the side.\nIt’s called private money lending, where everyday people — not banks or hedge funds — are pulling in returns just by wiring cash to local real-estate investors who need quick funding.\n\nBut how exactly does private money lending work, and is it right for you?\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nBenefits and risks of private money lending Think of private money lending as short-term, high-interest loans for real-estate deals. In this case, a private lender isn’t an institution like a bank, credit union or government-backed mortgage provider; it’s an individual or business that lends their own money.\nBecause they aren’t regulated like traditional banks, private lenders have more flexibility and they often focus on the value of a property instead of a borrower’s credit score or employment history. (1)\n\nFlippers, renovators, and buy-and-hold investors often need to close quickly, sometimes faster than a traditional bank will allow. So they borrow from private lenders instead, and pay for the privilege.\nA recent Business Insider article shared the story of Carl and Mindy Jensen, an early-retired couple who built a $5 million net worth. They’ve dabbled in different investment strategies, but one of their favorites is private lending. (2)\n“Private lending generates such a nice return that it's difficult to be like, ‘No, we don’t want the easy money,’” Mindy Jensen told Business Insider.\nAnother real-estate investor, Josh Lupo, was also featured in the article and said that interest rates of 10 to 12% are considered “normal” and 12 to 15% is common on shorter loans of around three to six months. The lender typically sets the terms.\n\n\"It takes us 30 minutes driving to the bank, wiring the funds, and then the investor that is borrowing the money sends us updates, and that's the extent of it,” Lupo told the website.\nBenefits High returns. You’re not pulling 12% from even the best high-yield savings accounts, and most rentals aren’t a short-term cash infusion. Private lenders like Lupo routinely see 12% on six-month loans or 15% on three-month deals, often backed by real estate.\n\nStory Continues\nHands-off investment. Private lending is an attractive option for older investors who’ve paid their dues unclogging toilets, replacing water heaters, and dealing with tenants. They still want real-estate-style returns, but without the headaches. Private lending keeps them in the game without the stress of being landlords.\n\nQuick turnaround. Real-estate investors love private lenders just as much. Speed is everything in the real estate game. Investor Mike Gorius told Business Insider he can close in eight days with private lenders compared with 30-plus days and a stack of paperwork when dealing with a bank (2).\nRisks Risk of default. If a borrower stops paying, you’re on the hook. Even though the deal is backed by real estate, there’s no guarantee you’ll recover your initial investment, especially if the borrower bails mid-project. You may also have to manage the foreclosure process.\nProperty-value risk. Private money loans may be secured by a house or building, but if values dip, the collateral may not cover what’s owed. In markets where After Repair Values (ARV)s get overly rosy, lenders can get left holding the bag.\n\nLiquidity and timing headaches. These deals are short-term, which means the borrower has to repay or refinance fast. If the market slows or a project hits delays, your money is stuck. And you can’t just sell your position since once that cash is in, it’s basically locked up. (3)\nRead More: This is the quiet portfolio shift many wealthy investors are making in 2026 . Should you consider it too?\nHow to get started If you think private lending is for you, you can get started using this roadmap:\nBuild capital first. Private lending requires cash, and while there’s no minimum, you’re looking at an average of between $50,000 and $250,000. (4)\nWhether it’s through house hacking, a rental or two, side hustles, dividend investing, or just saving aggressively, you’ll need to have some money ready to lend to get into the game.\n\nGet involved in your local real-estate scene. Relationships are key. The more investors you meet, the more deals you’ll be exposed to. Attend meetups, local investor events, and flip/wholesaler gatherings.\nStart small, scale smart. Most savvy private lenders grow by starting with a small loan, getting a good experience under their belt, lending again to repeat borrowers, and gradually levelling up to bigger deals. (5)\nThat said, if you want property exposure without the property headaches, private lending isn’t the only option to explore:\nREITs. Buy shares of real-estate investment trusts , collect dividends and stay hands-off.\nFractional ownership. Own slices of rental homes without ever talking to a tenant.\nCrowdfunded real-estate deals. Collectively invest in big commercial or residential projects using real estate crowdfunding investment platforms.\n\nGrocery-anchored commercial real estate. Grocery-anchored shopping centers can be surprisingly recession-resistant , and a smart diversifier.\nIf you’ve built up capital, want to earn some passive income, and love the idea of being the bank instead of the buyer, private lending might be the next big move in your portfolio. Just make sure you vet the deal and review your risks before handing over your money.\nYou May Also Like This $1B private real estate fund is now accessible to non-millionaires.

      "Content": "This Biotech Is Up 194% in a Year but One Investor Took Millions Off the Table\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:56 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INDV\n\nKey Points Oregon-based Stonepine Capital Management reduced its Indivior stake by 250,000 shares in the third quarter.\nThe overall position value fell by about $2.75 million from the previous period.\nAs of September 30, the fund reported holding 100,000 INDV shares valued at $2.41 million.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nOregon-based Stonepine Capital Management reported a sale of 250,000 shares of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ:INDV) , reducing its position by approximately $2.75 million, according to a November 13 SEC filing.\nWhat Happened According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated November 13, Stonepine Capital Management sold 250,000 shares of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ:INDV) during the third quarter. The transaction led to a decrease in the fund’s position value by approximately $2.75 million, bringing its Indivior holding to 100,000 shares worth $2.41 million at quarter-end.\n\nWhat Else to Know Stonepine's Indivior position now represents 1.96% of reportable AUM, down from 5.06% the previous quarter.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:VSTM: $23.58 million (19.17% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:ADMA: $10.83 million (8.81% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:EOLS: $9.43 million (7.67% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:ZVRA: $7.70 million (6.26% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:NKTR: $4.84 million (3.93% of AUM)\n\nAs of Friday, Indivior shares were priced at $36.21, up a staggering 194% over the past year and vastly outperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 15% in the same period.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of Friday)\n$36.21\nMarket Capitalization\n$4.53 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.18 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$124.00 million\n\nCompany Snapshot Indivior PLC develops and markets buprenorphine-based prescription drugs for opioid dependence, as well as treatments for substance use disorders, opioid overdose, and schizophrenia. Key products include SUBLOCADE, SUBUTEX PRO, SUBOXONE, OPVEE, and PERSERIS.\nThe company generates revenue primarily through the sale of branded pharmaceutical products, with a focus on long-acting injectable therapies and sublingual formulations targeting opioid use disorder and related conditions.\nIndivior's primary customers are healthcare providers, treatment centers, and government agencies addressing opioid addiction and mental health disorders in the United States and international markets.\n\nIndivior PLC is a specialty pharmaceutical company with a leading position in the treatment of opioid use disorder and related behavioral health conditions. The company leverages a diverse portfolio of proprietary therapies and invests in innovative pipeline assets targeting substance use and mental health disorders.\n\nStory Continues\nFoolish Take After years of volatility, Indivior finally looks like a company with operational momentum, and that’s exactly when position sizing starts to matter most for long-term investors. In the third quarter, Indivior posted $314 million in revenue, with SUBLOCADE sales up 15% year over year to $219 million, driving a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $120 million. Management raised full-year 2025 guidance sharply, now calling for $1.18 billion to $1.22 billion in revenue and as much as $420 million in adjusted EBITDA, while laying out a plan to generate at least $150 million in annual operating expense savings beginning next year.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, trimming a position after a 194% one-year run looks less like doubt and more like portfolio math. Stonepine remains concentrated in small and mid-cap biotech names, and even after the sale, Indivior still represents meaningful exposure relative to peers like ADMA, Eton, and ZVRA. Ultimately, Indivior’s fundamentals are improving, and the stock now reflects much of that progress. From here, returns hinge less on turnaround hope and more on sustained growth, cost discipline, and execution beyond this year.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable AUM: Assets under management that must be disclosed in quarterly SEC Form 13F filings by institutional investment managers.\nAUM (Assets Under Management): The total market value of investments managed on behalf of clients by a fund or firm.\nNet position change: The difference in the number or value of shares held in a security after a transaction.\nTop holdings: The largest investments in a fund’s portfolio, typically ranked by market value or portfolio percentage.\nQuarter-end: The last day of a fiscal quarter, often used as a reference point for financial reporting.\nBranded pharmaceutical products: Medications sold under a trademarked brand name, as opposed to generic versions.\nLong-acting injectable therapies: Medications administered by injection that release their active ingredients over an extended period.\nSublingual formulations: Medicines designed to be placed under the tongue for absorption into the bloodstream.\nOpioid use disorder: A medical condition characterized by problematic opioid use causing significant impairment or distress.\nPipeline assets: Experimental drugs or therapies a company is developing but have not yet reached the market.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $2 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTSLA\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom each have market caps around $1.6 trillion.\nAI is the driving force behind all three stock prices.\nOne of these tech leaders is seeing immediate results from AI spending, and its stock valuation is more attractive right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is responsible for adding trillions of dollars in value to a handful of companies over the last few years. Nvidia , for example, briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year, thanks to its dominant position in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). Four other companies sit firmly above the $2 trillion threshold as we approach the new year.\nBut three AI stocks currently have similar market caps around $1.6 trillion as of this writing, and are vying to become the first new $2 trillion company of 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Here's my prediction for the next company to top the milestone, and it could come as soon as next year.\nArtificial intelligence is fueling all three Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom have all seen their stock prices heavily influenced by advances in AI this year.\nMeta stock climbed higher early in the year as its efforts to improve its recommendation algorithms bore fruit. Ad revenue climbed higher as time spent on its apps increased, and ads became more effective. However, the stock took a step back recently as management shared plans to increase its AI-related spending.\n\nTesla's value is heavily tied to its robotaxi service and AI innovations. The stock received a boost over the summer when it launched its robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas. Investors added to those gains on promising progress on the company's next-generation AI chip for its vehicles.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator business has gained momentum in 2025, as the company signed big contracts with OpenAI and Anthropic, the latter of which is buying Alphabet 's Broadcom-designed tensor processing units (TPUs). To that end, Alphabet and Broadcom are seeing excellent progress in shifting more developer workloads to TPUs, which offer greater energy efficiency and cost savings versus Nvidia's GPUs.\nBroadcom stock took a step back after its last earnings report, as many analysts were disappointed with management's expectation that greater AI chip sales would come at a lower gross margin.\nWhile all three of these stocks have a path to a $2 trillion valuation in 2026, I expect Meta Platforms to reach the milestone first. Here's why.\n\nStory Continues\nAI-powered earnings growth at an attractive valuation Even with its run rate of $200 billion in annual revenue, Meta is still growing its bottom line quickly. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 20% in the third quarter, and improvements in AI are the reason.\nMeta has seen an increase in both ad impressions and price per ad for eight straight quarters. That indicates that it's increasing user engagement and opening new places within its apps for advertising while making ads more effective.\n\nManagement attributes a shift in its recommendation algorithm to make it more general across formats as the primary reason users are spending more time on its apps. Meta has seen similar improvements by applying the same methodology to its advertising algorithm. In other words, bigger models have directly translated into more revenue.\nThat trend should continue in 2026, as Meta opens up more opportunities for advertising, including on Threads and WhatsApp. It could also begin monetizing Meta AI, its generative AI chatbot. The improvements in its algorithms over the last couple of years should enable it to ramp up advertising quickly without as much negative impact on its pricing as we've seen in the past.\nThe bigger opportunity for Meta in 2026, though, may be the expansion of its generative AI features. It's reportedly working on an AI agent that can manage advertising campaigns for small businesses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly talks about the opportunity to handle everything involved with creating, testing, and optimizing ad campaigns on its platform through an AI agent.\n\nAnd chatbots specializing in sales and customer service for a company could open the door for more businesses to push Facebook and Instagram users to start messaging them through Meta's chat apps.\nWith small- and medium-sized businesses accounting for the bulk of advertisers on Meta's platform, these innovations have the potential to dramatically increase the amount they're willing to spend on ads. If the overhead for these clients is much lower, they can increase their ad spending and scale up their businesses faster.\nThose efforts should fuel another year of strong revenue growth. And while depreciation expense from the increase in AI-related capital expenditures could eat into earnings growth, Meta should be able to manage continued improvements in earnings per share with the help of share repurchases.\n\nThe stock trades for just 26 times forward earnings expectations, which is much lower than Broadcom's multiple and less than one-tenth the multiple Tesla stock trades for. I expect Meta to fetch a higher earnings multiple as it proves its AI spending to be well worth it once again in 2026, pushing its valuation to $2 trillion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Ahead of 2026, According to Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Palantir)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Morningstar analysts recently ranked Nvidia and Microsoft as the two best artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\nBrian Colello at Morningstar says Nvidia has an economic moat due to its leadership in GPUs, networking, and software tools needed for artificial intelligence.\nDan Romanoff at Morningstar says Microsoft’s cloud computing unit has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence due to investments in OpenAI.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nPalantir Technologies has been one of the best-performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent years. Shares have advanced 1,000% since January 2024, but many analysts worry about its valuation. That may explain why Palantir did not appear on Morningstar 's recent list detailing the best AI stocks to buy now.\nInstead, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took the top two spots, followed by Amazon , Broadcom , and Meta Platforms . But optimism concerning Nvidia and Microsoft is not limited to Morningstar. Most Wall Street analysts believe the stocks are undervalued.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $190.\nAmong 63 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 29% upside from its current share price of $488.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Morningstar analyst Brian Colello writes:\nTo summarize, Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its full-stack strategy. The company is best known for its GPUs, chips that accelerate demanding data center workloads like AI training and AI inference. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs best-in-class GPUs with CPUs, high-speed interconnects, and networking platforms, such that the company essentially builds entire data centers.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has spent the better part of two decades creating its CUDA software platform, which comprises an unparalleled number of code libraries, pretrained models, and application frameworks that assist developers. While custom AI chips developed by Broadcom may be cheaper, the total cost of ownership is often higher because they lack pre-built software tools.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has over 90% market share in data center GPUs, a market where sales are projected to grow at 36% annually through 2033, and the company is likely to maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 48% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2028. That makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look cheap.\n\n2. Microsoft Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for Microsoft 365 (a suite that includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), the company also has a strong position in other software verticals, including business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning.\n\nMicrosoft has added generative AI copilots to several software products and monthly active users surpassed 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter. And CEO Satya Nadella told analysts, \"Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services sales. \"Azure has several distinct advantages, including that it offers customers a painless way to experiment and move select workloads to the cloud,\" according to Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff. \"Based on its investment in OpenAI, the company has also emerged as a leader in AI.\"\n\nMicrosoft owns a 27% equity stake in OpenAI and it has exclusive rights to the AI start-up's most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5). Also, The Information reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the agreement. Those payments will top $1 billion this year, up from about $500 million last year, according to TechCrunch.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% during the last four quarters, which makes the current valuation look more reasonable. Nvidia is still the more attractive option, but I think patient investors should consider buying a small position in both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Peter Thiel warns US real estate ‘catastrophe’ will deal massive blow to young Americans, but boomers might get windfall\n\nJing Pan\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 5:27 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nPYPL\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nAs a co-founder of PayPal and the first outside investor in Facebook, Peter Thiel is widely recognized for his expertise in tech. But now, the billionaire venture capitalist is sounding the alarm on an entirely different sector: real estate.\n\nDuring an interview with Commonwealth Canada, Thiel drew upon the insights of 19th-century economist Henry George to underscore the gravity of America’s real estate crisis (1).\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“The basic Georgist obsession was real estate, and it was if you weren't really careful, you would get runaway real estate prices, and the people who owned the real estate would make all the gains in a society,” Thiel said.\nThe core of the issue, Thiel explained, lies in the “extremely inelastic” nature of real estate, especially in regions with strict zoning laws.\n“The dynamic ends up being that you add 10% to the population in a city, and maybe the house prices go up 50%, and maybe people's salaries go up, but they don't go up by 50%,” he said. “So the GDP grows, but it's a giant windfall to the boomer homeowners and to the landlords, and it's a massive hit to the lower-middle class and to young people who can never get on the housing ladder.”\n\nThiel warned that this “Georgist real estate catastrophe” is playing out across many “Anglosphere countries,” including the U.S., Britain and Canada.\n‘Incredible wealth transfer’ The surge in U.S. home prices has been nothing short of alarming for non-homeowners. Over the past five years, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index has climbed by 45% (2). This indicates that, on average, the value of a single-family home in the U.S. has nearly doubled in that five-year period.\n\nThough there is reason to believe that growth could be slowing down. A Reuters poll of property experts suggests that U.S. home prices will rise just 1.4% in 2026 (3). While that increase would be relatively minimal compared to the last few years, it’s nevertheless an increase.\nThiel connected growing prices to inflation, stating, “There's a way you could talk about inflation in terms of the prices of eggs or groceries, but that's not that big a cost item, even for lower-middle-class people. The really big cost item is the rent.”\n\nStory Continues\nAt its core, Thiel argued, the issue boils down to supply and demand.\n“If you just add more people to the mix, and you're not allowed to build new houses because of zoning laws, where it's too expensive, where it's too regulated and restricted, then the prices go up a lot,” he said. “And it's this incredible wealth transfer from the young and the lower-middle-class to the upper middle class and the landlords and the old.”\n\nThiel isn’t the only one raising the alarm. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has highlighted similar concerns.\n“The real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough housing … It’s hard to find — to zone lots that are in places where people want to live … Where are we going to get the supply?” Powell said at a press conference in September.\nThe gap in the housing market is significant. The U.S. had a housing shortage of 4.7 million properties in 2023, despite having added 1.4 million new homes, according to a Zillow report (4).",

Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nOn Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%.\nThe company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence.\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nBecause of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion.\nAs an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance?\n\n→ These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nMetaX Is the Latest Example of a DeepSeek Market Scare On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter.\nAt the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500.\n\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nThe MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing.\nFor analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices.\nIn turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out.\n\nStory Continues\nBut it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived.\n\nNow, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX.\nWhy MetaX Isn’t the Market Threat It’s Made out to Be NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term.\nOver the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times.\n\nMetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years.\nAdditionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success.\nCompounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.”\nFund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.”\n\nNVIDIA and Its Shareholders Will Be Fine Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\nNVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon.\n\nThe stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%.\nOver the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float.\nThe article \" Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare? \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But the communications sector actually includes several major tech players, such as Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, which returned 66.6% for 2025 through Wednesday, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, which was up 14.4% year to date.\n\nDigging further, the S&P 500 semiconductor group has returned 45.5% this year, according to LSEG.

With about 400,000 of Vanguard’s retirement-account customers required to take RMDs, that 7% made for quite a set of IRS penalties.\n\nThe current IRS rule is that people with retirement accounts must begin taking required minimum distributions at age 73. If you are in any doubt about when to begin taking RMDs, or how to address being late or to plan ahead, you should call the company (or companies) handling your retirement accounts immediately to formulate a plan. There are many ways to handle RMDs.\nA retirement-savings opportunity Some people prepare for retirement by putting as much money as possible into tax-deferred retirement accounts every year.

Beth Pinsker dug into all the new retirement-account contribution limits and tax rules .\nIf you are self-employed, run your own company or even have a side hustle, you have an opportunity to save much more for retirement.

      "Content": "Meta Platforms Might Be the Biggest Bargain in Big Tech\n\nJoey Frenette\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nQuick Read Meta trades at 22.1x forward P/E. This is close to the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven.\nMorgan Stanley expects revenue re-acceleration from stronger ad demand and AI-improved ad performance.\nMeta is shifting from open-source LLaMA models to closed-source AI models including Avocado and Mango.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMeta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) certainly stands out as one of the bigger \"deals\" to be had in big tech for those looking to play the value side of the AI trade. Undoubtedly, when it comes to the Magnificent Seven, investors might wish to be more selective with which members of the famed group they buy going into the new year.\nWhether that's due to the variance in performance between the individual names, the different slates of expectations set ahead of them, or their potential to make up ground in this AI race, there are reasons to get pickier when it comes to the most magnificent names atop this market.\nSince it feels unlikely that the non-stop chatter about stretched stock valuations, bubbles, and all the doubts that AI can live up to its potential will pull back in the new year, investors might need to increase their tolerance for turbulence going into the new year, especially with the companies that have been spending far more than your average investor might be comfortable with.\n\nShares of Meta certainly appear dirt-cheap, but are expectations too elevated given its AI spend? At this juncture, the higher the AI spending bar, the higher the expectations bar is likely to be in the new year, and for companies like Meta Platforms, it seems like the shares are looking relatively cheap for a reason. But what happens if there are decent returns that lie just a bit further down the road that investors and analysts can't yet see?\n\nIn such a case, shares of Meta Platforms may very well be in for more consolidation or even downside before investors come to the realization that its AI strategy is paying off, perhaps many times over. Some upbeat analysts over at Morgan Stanley seem to think that the new year could be incredibly kind to the social-media juggernaut.\nNotably, they see revenue re-acceleration at the hands of stronger ad demand as well as improved performance of ads at the hands of AI. Add Reels and WhatsApp business messaging momentum into the equation, and it certainly feels like 2026 will see enough of an AI return to soothe the fears of the rising tide of AI spend.\n\nStory Continues\nAnother bull, Colin Sebastian, over at Baird, also thinks 2026 could be a good year for Meta Platforms shares. He thinks new AI models (think closed-source Avocado and Mango models, as Meta Platforms moves on from its open-source LLaMA model) might help push the name to $815 per share. Undoubtedly, the sudden and surprising shift from open-source to closed-source models might be a head-scratcher for some. Either way, it seems to be the right way to go, especially given industry trends.\n\nThe bottom line I think Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg can deliver more than a few surprises in the new year, as the company potentially looks to give investors what they want over the near- to medium-term while also ensuring enough is spent on the long-term opportunity at hand. On the one hand, some of the bears see the firm as spending a bit too much on AI efforts. On the other hand, some skeptics might see Meta Platforms as \"lagging\" in the AI race.\n\nUndoubtedly, there's room to catch up if Meta AI is to catch up to the likes of the current leaders. Either way, it's just too easy to be bearish on the stock right here. And that's why the stage might be set for a big rally that helps shares catch up to the rest of the Mag Seven after a rough, but still positive (shares up 11% year to date) year.\nAt the time of this writing, Meta Platforms' shares are going for 22.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). That's the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven, thanks in part to the nasty decline the stock encountered back in October.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Meta Platforms' AI-Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMeta Platforms META is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META’s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\n\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META’s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms’ initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company’s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN, are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\n\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space Meta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nAlphabet’s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans.

      "Content": "Is ORCL Stock Poised for Growth Amid Rising AI Infrastructure Demand?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nOracle ’s ORCL positioning in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market presents a complex investment picture as the company navigates unprecedented demand against escalating capital requirements. The database software provider reported second-quarter fiscal 2026 results that underscored both the opportunity and challenge ahead.\n\nCloud infrastructure revenues surged 68% year over year to reach $4.1 billion, with GPU-related revenues jumping 177% as customers secured computing capacity for AI workloads. Total remaining performance obligations climbed 438% to $523 billion, driven primarily by commitments from major technology companies, including Meta and NVIDIA. The metric expanded by $68 billion sequentially during the quarter, reflecting accelerating contract signings.\n\nHowever, the aggressive expansion strategy carries significant financial implications. Oracle now projects capital expenditures of approximately $50 billion for fiscal 2026, up from an earlier $35 billion estimate and substantially above the prior year's $21.2 billion. Free cash flow turned negative by approximately $10 billion in the November quarter, exceeding analyst expectations by a considerable margin.\n\nThe company's collaboration with the Department of Energy, announced in December 2025, and its flagship Stargate supercluster project with OpenAI demonstrate Oracle's infrastructure ambitions. The recently unveiled Zettascale10 system promises multi-gigawatt AI capacity, connecting hundreds of thousands of GPUs across distributed data centers.\n\nWhether Oracle can convert its substantial contract backlog into profitable revenue streams while managing debt levels remains the central question for investors evaluating the stock's growth potential amid surging AI infrastructure demand.\n\nHyperscaler Rivals Accelerate AI Infrastructure Investments Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN are pursuing parallel AI infrastructure buildouts with significantly higher capital commitments. Microsoft projects $120 billion in capital expenditure for 2026, anchored by Azure's sustained growth momentum between 31% and 40% throughout 2025. Microsoft's AI services contributed nearly 20 percentage points to Azure's expansion as the company deepened its OpenAI partnership. Amazon announced plans to spend $125 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from $83 billion in 2024, with the vast majority directed toward AI infrastructure for AWS. Amazon's strategic focus includes custom Trainium and Inferentia chips to reduce reliance on third-party GPU suppliers. Both Microsoft and Amazon maintain stronger balance sheets compared to Oracle's leveraged position, though Amazon faces uncertainty around monetizing its custom silicon investments.\n\nStory Continues\nORCL’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Oracle have lost 6.1% in the past six-month period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 20.4% and the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s 1.6% decline.\nORCL’s 6-Month Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, ORCL stock is currently trading at a premium with a trailing 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 34.77x, which is higher than the industry average of 34.19x. Oracle carries a Value Score of D.\nORCL’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $7.33 per share, marking an upward revision of 7.6% over the past 30 days.

This is the biggest transaction Nvidia has made so far to buy anything. The goal of the move is to make Nvidia more competitive in the quickly increasing market for AI hardware and data centers.The business will use Groq's specialized chip designs in future products and hire Jonathan Ross, the startup's CEO, and other top engineers. Ross was part of the team that started Google's own AI chip initiative.The deal is part of a larger wave of investments worth billions of dollars that are changing the AI infrastructure environment. Recently, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta, and Amazon have made big promises to increase their AI processing power and work with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and CoreWeave.Analysts argue that Nvidia's partnership with Groq will help it stay ahead of AMD, Intel, and bespoke chipmakers in the AI accelerator market by giving it access to more technologies. The transaction also supports Nvidia's plan to improve vertical integration as demand for AI computing keeps going up until 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Sector Rotation: 2 Smart Money Moves for 2026\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:15 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: XLC\n\nUNH\n\nXLV\n\nMETA\n\nNFLX\n\nKey Points The recent shift in interest rate policy is encouraging institutional investors to move capital into undervalued sectors with strong cash flows.\nCommunication services stocks offer a compelling mix of reasonable valuations and earnings growth driven by resilient digital advertising spending.\nThe healthcare sector offers a unique combination of defensive stability and explosive growth potential from pharmaceutical innovations.\nInterested in Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has officially shifted gears. By lowering interest rates in mid-December 2025, the Fed sent a decisive signal to the global markets. For the better part of the last year, the stock market narrative was dominated by hardware and semiconductors. Investors poured billions into the companies building the physical infrastructure of artificial intelligence (AI). However, as borrowing costs drop and the economic temperature begins to cool, the market is entering a new phase.\nWe are witnessing a sector rotation. This phenomenon occurs when large institutional investors, the smart money, move capital from one area of the market to another to adapt to changing economic conditions. The capital that fueled the hardware rally is now looking for new homes. Specifically, investors are targeting sectors that offer a combination of reasonable valuations, steady cash flow, and defensive stability.\n\n→ Vertical Aerospace Traded a Delay for a Major Advantage\nTwo specific areas are emerging as winners in this new environment: Communication Services and Healthcare. By analyzing the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLC) and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLV), investors can identify opportunities to build a portfolio with a strong outlook heading into 2026.\nThe Mechanics of the Market Shift To understand why this rotation is occurring, investors must examine how interest rates affect business valuations. When rates are high, investors tend to favor companies with massive immediate cash flows or speculative growth. But when rates fall, the playbook changes. Lower interest rates make dividend-paying stocks more attractive because they compete more effectively with bonds. Simultaneously, lower rates reduce the cost of debt for companies that rely on borrowing to fund operations.\n\n→ Forget The Chips: Oracle Wins Phase 2 of AI\nThis creates a Goldilocks scenario for specific sectors. The market is broadening. The narrow leadership of a few massive tech companies is giving way to a wider array of opportunities. Analysts at major financial firms have already adjusted, or are beginning to adjust, their ratings to reflect this. They are pivoting toward sectors that have sat on the sidelines during the semiconductor frenzy, strategically realigning their portfolios to capture the next leg of projected growth.\n\nStory Continues\nCommunication Services: Growth at a Discount One of the primary beneficiaries of this rotation is the Communication Services sector. Multiple firms, including RBC Capital, recently upgraded this sector to Overweight, a rating that suggests they expect these stocks to outperform the broader market averages. The argument for this sector is built on relative valuation. While hardware stocks trade at historically high multiples relative to earnings, communication services stocks appear far more reasonably priced.\n\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nThe Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) is the primary vehicle for this trade. While still a technology-heavy investment, the XLC focuses on Service Tech (software, media, and search) rather than physical chips.\nThe fund is heavily concentrated. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) together account for roughly 40% of the portfolio. This concentration brings specific advantages.\nDigital advertising spending has remained surprisingly resilient, providing a steady stream of revenue for these top holdings.\nFurthermore, these companies are shifting from spending on AI to monetizing it. By using AI to make advertising algorithms more efficient, they are boosting profit margins.\n\nBeyond the giants, the fund also includes major entertainment companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Disney (NYSE: DIS). As the streaming wars stabilize and these companies focus on profitability over subscriber growth, they add another layer of value to the fund. This mix of advertising dominance and media consolidation makes XLC an attractive option for growth-oriented investors.\nHealthcare: The Defensive Growth Engine On the other side of the spectrum lies the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) . Historically, healthcare is viewed as a defensive sector. Demand for medical care is inelastic; people require prescriptions, surgeries, and insurance coverage regardless of whether the economy is booming or entering a recession. This stability makes XLV a critical anchor for portfolios during periods of uncertainty.\n\nHowever, the 2026 iteration of XLV offers more than just safety. It includes a significant growth kicker driven by pharmaceutical innovation.\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has grown to become the fund's largest holding, representing roughly 15% of the ETF.\nThis dominance is mainly due to the explosive global demand for GLP-1 medications used for weight loss and diabetes management.\nThis single innovation has decoupled the fund from the slow-growth reputation of traditional healthcare.\nThe fund is also diversified beyond pharmaceuticals. It holds significant positions in health insurance providers such as UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) and medical device manufacturers such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO).\nThese companies benefit from the Silver Tsunami, the aging global demographic that requires increasing levels of medical care. While there are risks, such as potential government policy changes regarding drug pricing, the sector generally exhibits lower volatility than the wider market. This means XLV tends to fluctuate less violently than the S&P 500, offering a smoother ride for investors.\n\nThe Income Factor: Dividends and Yields For investors rotating into these sectors, income plays a vital role. Both XLV and XLC recently went ex-dividend on Dec. 22, 2025. This technical term simply means the cutoff date for the latest cash payment has passed. Consequently, the share prices of both funds adjusted downward yesterday. This is a standard accounting procedure: the cash that is about to be mailed to shareholders is no longer part of the company's value, so the stock price drops by that exact amount.\n\nWhile new investors missed the Dec. 24 payout, the yields remain a key attraction. XLV currently offers a dividend yield of approximately 1.6%, while XLC sits closer to 1%. In a lower-interest-rate environment, these regular cash distributions are valuable. They act as a buffer against price declines. When these dividends are reinvested to buy more shares, they compound returns over time.\nThe Barbell Strategy: Balancing Risk and Reward The divergence between Communication Services and Healthcare allows investors to deploy what is known as a barbell strategy. This approach involves balancing two distinct asset types to manage risk.\nOn one end of the barbell is XLC . It captures the upside potential of the digital economy, with a heavy weighting toward the growth engines of Google and Meta. It is the offensive player in the portfolio, designed to capitalize on positive market sentiment.\n\nOn the other end is XLV . It provides a solid floor, supported by essential human needs and breakthrough science. It is the defensive player, designed to protect capital and provide income if the economic landing gets bumpy.\nRather than viewing these sectors as competing alternatives, investors should view them as complementary. As the economic landscape shifts in 2026, combining the aggressive earnings momentum of Service Tech with the defensive reliability of Healthcare offers a prudent way to navigate the market. By stepping out of the crowded hardware trade and into these diversified sectors, investors can position themselves for a balanced and profitable year.\nThe article \" Sector Rotation: 2 Smart Money Moves for 2026 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The authority's published tally showed Asfura with 40.3% of the vote versus 39.5% for Nasralla, with ruling-party candidate Rixi Moncada trailing at 19.2%. The result came more than three weeks after election day, following repeated allegations of irregularities from Nasralla and Moncada, and was formally released after markets closed on Christmas Eve, a timing that may have limited the immediate risk of unrest.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with META.\nIs META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nNasralla rejected the outcome in a livestream on Facebook ( NASDAQ:META ) and TikTok, calling the vote a fraud and saying results were declared without all ballots being counted, while also alleging manipulation in congressional and mayoral races. He compared the situation to Venezuela's disputed election last year under Nicolas Maduro and referenced Honduras's own 2017 election, which triggered deadly protests after a result widely viewed as fraudulent. Even so, Nasralla said he would pursue peaceful and legal avenues rather than mobilizing supporters in the streets, framing his response as an effort to defend the vote without escalating tensions.\n\nFrom an investor perspective, early market signals suggested cautious optimism. Honduran bonds rallied after Asfura, a civil engineer and former two-term mayor of Tegucigalpa, took the lead in preliminary counts, reflecting expectations of a more market-friendly agenda. Asfura has pledged to cut red tape, seek new free trade agreements, and promote large infrastructure projects, including a liquefied gas pipeline linking Mexico, El Salvador, and Honduras, alongside fiscal incentives aimed at attracting foreign direct investment. He has also said he would reverse Honduras's 2023 decision under President Xiomara Castro to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing, instead prioritizing closer relations with the US, Taiwan, and Israel. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was quick to congratulate Asfura, a development that could align with support he received from Donald Trump in the days leading up to the vote, even as Honduras's long history of electoral controversy continues to shape the political and investment backdrop.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 25)\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThis year, one of the better performers among the Magnificent 7 had been Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ: META ). But its third-quarter earnings report raised investor concerns about the company’s massive capital spending on artificial intelligence initiatives. In addition, Meta says it plans to make significant cuts to the budget of its Reality Labs metaverse division in the coming year. The stock is down 13.6% since the quarterly report was released.\n\nStrong quarterly reports earlier this year (despite a tax charge) had lent credence to the claim that Meta would continue to outshine its competitors over the next year. The share price hit an all-time high of $796.25 back in August. Due to the recent pullback, the stock is up 4.9% year over year, underperforming the broader market. Furthermore, the near-term future of the economy is uncertain—just like the markets themselves—and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a controversial figure. Certainly, Zuckerberg's sudden shift to the metaverse and brand name change to Meta Platforms raised a few eyebrows several years ago.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Meta Platforms Inc.’s ( NASDAQ: META ) AI push has been a key driver for the company in 2025, with integrations coming across numerous platforms, which is fueling engagement and increasing ad sales.\nDespite economic cloudiness, Meta announced that its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) estimate increased significantly, much of which will be allocated to AI project development and integration.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNow, the Meta Platforms CEO is shifting the company's focus and riding a powerful, bullish trend. Against this complex backdrop with many moving parts, investors should consider the wide range of Meta stock price targets and formulate a strategy for all possible outcomes. To help, 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis. Let's jump in.\nWhy Invest in Meta Platforms? Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room. Investors should not rely on Meta Platforms' Reality Labs metaverse business to drive the company's near-term future growth. In Q3 2025, Reality Labs generated $470 million in revenue, up from $370 million in revenue in the prior quarter. However, during that same time frame, Reality Labs recorded a loss from operations of $4.43 billion.\n\nFortunately, it appears that the CEO's attention has turned to a different tech field lately. In particular, Zuckerberg seems to expect AI to be Meta Platforms' key driver going forward. AI integrations into Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp could provide an economic moat for Meta Platforms if new features translate to greater user engagement. WhatsApp, in particular, has seen notable growth with more than 3 billion monthly users now.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta's AI focus evidently helped the company succeed in the third quarter of the year despite losses in its metaverse business. Impressively, Meta Platforms grew its revenue 26% year over year to $51.2 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus call for $49.5 billion. Furthermore, excluding a one-time tax charge, the company's earnings per share (EPS) surged 20% to $7.25, easily outpacing the analysts' consensus estimate of $6.74.\n\nThere's no doubt that Zuckerberg is all-in on the AI revolution now. He envisions a future in which AI will be used for \"a lot\" of \"social tasks.\" And he believes it's \"really compelling\" that AI will \"get to know you better and better.\" Some reporters have expressed skepticism of an AI-infused future. Yet, if Meta Platforms can parlay machine learning into profits, investors shouldn't dismiss the growth potential of Meta stock.\nAnother key driver for Meta Platforms is its Threads short-form messaging platform. Granted, Threads is still playing catch-up to the popular X platform, which is owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Still, Threads is making inroads as its monthly active user count grew from 320 million in 2024's fourth quarter to 350 million in Q1 of 2025. That's not at the level of X, which reportedly has more than 580 million monthly active users. Yet, perhaps AI feature integration can make Threads even more competitive with X in the coming quarters.\n\nThe company expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenue to range from $56 billion to $59 billion. That is expected to be driven primarily by ongoing strength in its advertising business, bolstered by the positive impact of AI-driven enhancements to ad targeting and user engagement across its family of apps.\nMeta Platforms as a Stock It is impossible to know how the economy will perform going forward. Similarly, it remains unclear whether Meta Platforms will achieve significant returns on its AI investments. These unknowns will not stop analysts from publishing their Meta stock price predictions, though.\nOppenheimer and Benchmark downgraded the stock following the third-quarter earnings release, citing increased capex concerns. However, BofA Securities has reiterated its Buy rating on the shares, keeping its price target at $900 and affirming long-term confidence in Meta, citing its user base and potential AI integration opportunities. Cantor Fitzgerald also reaffirmed its positive stance by reiterating an Overweight rating and $920 price target. It anticipates that improvements in AI execution will lead to a \"sentiment reversal\" for the company in 2026.\n\nThe aforementioned uncertainties are reflected in the wide range of Wall Street analysts' price targets for Meta Platforms. The Zuckerberg-led firm has a high price target of $1,117.00, a median price target of $837.15, and a low target price of $685.00. However, the consensus recommendation of 67 analysts covering the stock remains to buy shares.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$685.00\n2.6%\nMedian\n$837.15\n25.4%\nHigh\n$1,117.00\n67.3%\n\nMeta Platforms 2026 Outlook Meta Platforms raised its 2025 capex estimate from a range of $66 billion to $72 billion to a range of $70 billion to $72 billion. By now, you can probably guess what Meta Platforms is spending those extra billions on. If you guessed AI, you are correct. More specifically, Meta Platforms' management anticipates \"additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.\"\n\nHence, the multi-billion-dollar question is whether Meta Platforms can effectively leverage its costly AI enhancements. That's difficult to predict. The same goes for the state of the economy, which might not support an increase in ad spending if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate in the remainder of this year.\n24/7 Wall St.'s Meta forecast is a more bullish than the mean forecast, calling for the share price to rise to $935.29 by the end of next year. That implies a run of 40.1%. It is based on the company’s ability to sustain strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency. This should drive its bottom line despite higher capital expenditures for AI objectives.\nUltimately, your price target for Meta Platforms stock should depend on whether you expect the company to take full advantage of ramped-up AI features. If so, then get ready for Meta Platforms stock to eventually head for new all-time highs. However, it may be a bumpy ride along the way.\n\nMeta’s Heavy AI Spending Justified Says Pro. Is He Right?\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaires Are Buying an AI Stock That Could Be the Apple of the 2030s\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Meta recently debuted its first pair of augmented reality smart glasses, a stepping stone along a roadmap that leads to fully-immersive glasses powered by superintelligence.\nJust as smartphones have replaced personal computers for many tasks, Mark Zuckerberg says smart glasses will displace smartphones as our primary computing devices in the future.\nMeta dominates the nascent smart glasses market, and it could become a consumer electronics giant if it successfully integrates its devices with a superintelligence system.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized mobile computing when it launched the first iPhone in 2007. Since then, smartphones have gradually become our primary computing devices, but it stands to reason that another technology could eventually fill that role.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is betting on smart glasses. The company currently earns the vast majority of its money by selling targeted ads across its social media properties. But smart glasses developed by its Reality Labs business unit could eventually become a major source of revenue, especially with assistance from its Superintelligence Labs unit.\nThe following hedge fund billionaires, all of whom outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three years, bought shares of Meta Platforms in the third quarter.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management added 793,500 shares. Meta Platforms is his eighth-largest holding, excluding options.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors added 1.4 million shares. Meta Platforms is his fourth-largest holding, excluding options.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management added 355,900 shares. Meta Platforms is his largest holding.\nHere's what investors should know.\nWhy Meta Platforms could be the Apple of the 2030s In September, Meta Platforms launched its first augmented reality (AR) smart glasses, which feature a built-in display on the right lens. The glasses, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, also integrate the artificial intelligence assistant Meta AI. While analysts do not anticipate earthshaking sales, they do see the product as an important stepping stone toward the Orion glasses.\n\nMeta first announced Orion in 2024 and is reportedly working toward a product launch in 2027. Orion smart glasses will have a built-in display on both lenses, creating a true holographic experience that blends the digital and physical worlds. Meta eventually plans to pair Orion with a superintelligence system, an AI assistant that surpasses human intelligence and can teach itself.\n\"Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote earlier this year. \"Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.\"\n\nStory Continues\nZuckerberg does not mean we will abandon smartphones in the future. Instead, he thinks AR smart glasses (paired with superintelligence) will be our go-to devices. For instance, personal computers are still very useful, but smartphones have replaced them for various tasks. Zuckerberg thinks smart glasses will displace smartphones in much the same way.\n\nImportantly, Meta has been investing in smart glasses for years, and Zuckerberg says the company is \"several years ahead\" of its closest competitors. Indeed, Meta accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025, up from 66% in the second half of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research.\nIf everything comes together as Zuckerberg expects -- meaning AI smart glasses become our primary computing devices, and Meta maintains its leadership position in the market -- Orion could be as successful as the iPhone, if not more so. In that scenario, Meta could become the Apple of the 2030s as it evolves into a consumer electronics giant.\nWhy Meta Platforms stock is worth buying today In the near term, the investment thesis for Meta Platforms centers on its status as the second-largest ad tech company, a position derived from its dominance in social media. Facebook and Instagram generate consumer data on a large scale, creating a network effect that makes Meta's content recommendation and ad targeting engines increasingly effective over time.\n\nMeta Platforms has invested in artificial intelligence to reinforce that network effect. New AI-powered recommendation and ranking systems are deepening user engagement and improving ad conversion rates (i.e., more clicks) by showing people more relevant content across its social media properties. Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan writes, \"Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share.\"\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842.50 per share. That implies 26% upside from its current share price of $665.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

These 29 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.\nNebius Group Investment Narrative Recap To own Nebius, you have to believe that demand for high performance AI infrastructure will stay strong enough for the company to scale capacity, execute its mega-deals with Microsoft and Meta, and move toward sustainable profitability despite heavy capital needs and stock volatility. The Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 launch reinforces that core thesis by putting Blackwell Ultra into production, but it does not materially change the key near term catalyst of capacity build-out and delivery against those contracts, or the biggest risk around funding and execution.\n\nAmong recent announcements, the multi year Microsoft AI infrastructure agreement, valued at over US$19 billion, is the most relevant context for Nebius AI Cloud 3.1. The new Blackwell Ultra based platform and real time capacity tools are what Nebius must lean on to reliably serve that take or pay style contract, which in turn underpins expectations for rapid revenue growth and heightens the importance of managing capital intensity and customer concentration.\nBut while the growth story is appealing, investors should also be aware that customer concentration and funding needs could...\nRead the full narrative on Nebius Group (it's free!)\nNebius Group's narrative projects $3.2 billion revenue and $428.7 million earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Nebius Group's forecasts yield a $159.29 fair value , a 75% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives Thirty one members of the Simply Wall St Community currently see Nebius’s fair value anywhere between US$15.07 and US$159.29, reflecting sharply different expectations.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk weighed in on an AI debate, siding with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis after Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: META ) outgoing AI chief Yann LeCun dismissed the idea of \"general intelligence\" as an illusion.\n\nMusk Weighs In On AGI Debate Musk amplified Hassabis' rebuttal to LeCun in a post on X , writing simply, \"Demis is right,\" throwing his support behind the DeepMind chief in a widening public dispute over whether artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a meaningful concept.\nThe exchange underscores growing divisions among leading AI researchers over how intelligence should be defined — and whether human intelligence itself can be considered \"general.\"\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nHassabis Says Brains Are Fundamentally General Hassabis pushed back strongly against LeCun's statement that there is \"no such thing as general intelligence,\" arguing that LeCun is conflating general intelligence with the idea of universal intelligence.\nIn a detailed post, Hassabis said human brains are among the most complex systems known and are, by design, highly general learning machines.\n\nWhile acknowledging that no real-world system can escape some degree of specialization, he said the architecture of the human brain — much like modern AI foundation models — is capable of learning any computable task in theory, given sufficient time, memory and data.\nHe added that humanity's ability to invent chess, science and modern engineering, despite evolving for survival tasks like hunting and gathering, demonstrates the breadth of human intelligence rather than its limits.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nLeCun Calls Humans Extremely Specialized LeCun also responded to Hassabis' criticism, saying the disagreement is largely semantic.\n\nStory Continues\nHe objected to equating \"general\" with \"human-level,\" arguing that humans are deeply specialized systems optimized for efficiency in narrow domains.\nWhile conceding that the human brain is theoretically Turing complete, LeCun said it is highly inefficient for most computational problems under real-world constraints.\nHe also argued that the brain can represent only a vanishingly small fraction of all possible functions, making true generality impossible in practice.\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me.

      "Content": "Broadcom's Semiconductor Growth Picks Up: A Sign of More Upside?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:02 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nGOOG\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nBroadcom ’s AVGO Semiconductor revenues are benefiting from strong demand for XPUs, which are a type of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) necessary to train Generative AI (Gen AI) models. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI revenues surged 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. XPU adoption accelerated in the reported quarter as enterprises continue to use these to train their large language models and monetize their platforms through inference APIs and applications. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are major users of these XPUs.\n\nAVGO’s expanding clientele, which now includes Anthropic, is driving growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received a $10 billion order to sell Alphabet’s latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received an additional order worth $11 billion from the same customer. The company’s current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as AVGO’s latest 102-terabit per second Tomahawk 6 switch continues to gain traction. AVGO now expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 AI revenues to double year over year to $8.2 billion.\n\nAVGO’s networking portfolio is gaining from strong demand for Tomahawk 6 products, as well as the Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router. Broadcom also has a rich partner base that includes the likes of OpenAI, Walmart, NVIDIA, Canonical, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, among others. AVGO expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 Semiconductor revenues of $12.3 billion, suggesting 50% year-over-year growth. Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to grow 2% year over year to $6.8 billion.\n\nAVGO Faces Tough Competition in the Semiconductor Market Broadcom is a major player in the semiconductor market, but is facing stiff competition from NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for Gen AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues from Data Center (accounted for 89.8% of NVDA revenues) jumped 66% year over year and 25% sequentially to $51.22 billion.\n\nMarvell Technology is benefiting from the strong demand environment across the data center end market. MRVL’s data center end-market revenues jumped 39% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, propelled by strong growth across AI-driven demand for custom XPU silicon and electro-optics interconnect products. Marvell Technology’s AI-driven custom silicon business has secured more than 20 multi-generational XPU and XPU-attach socket wins. MRVL’s design pipeline has expanded to more than 50 opportunities worth $75 billion, underscoring hyperscalers’ growing reliance on Marvell’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nStory Continues\nAVGO’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Broadcom shares have appreciated 45.7% in a year, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nAVGO Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe AVGO stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/earnings of 33.89X compared with the broader sector’s 27.78X.

The the four names that we've identified as top picks for the year are Amazon, Meta, Mercado Libre, and uh DoorDash. And we have more overweight ratings than those, but those four really stand out.\n00:24 Speaker A\nAnd and talk to us a little bit about why. I mean, when you're talking about Meta, uh and and others, what's the what are the driving forces going into 2026?\n00:40 Scott\nSo you have um in in each case, you know, a period of under performance related to um mostly investment cycles. You know, Amazon has spending around AWS and AI infrastructure, which is going to start I think to pay off in 2026. and you're going to see an acceleration in the AWS business, which investors will like and that should help the stock perform. Meta, you know, is on the very front end of an investment cycle. Growth is extremely strong and I think as investors get more visibility to the spend uh and into the second half of 2026, that stock's going to recover uh quite nicely because the dollars are going to be proven to be well spent. And then Mercado Libre and DoorDash also similarly that there's they're spending to grow. You know, we had a period of digestion in 2022 and a period of operating leverage in this sector in um in 23 and 24. As we've entered 25 and gone through 25, it's normalized and in 26, you're starting to see investment cycles again. There's nothing wrong with that. I just think it creates an opportunity in terms of the pullback in the stocks that when you get to the other side of the investment cycle, you get to experience excess returns. So, it's a very back half weighted uh set of recommendations that we think will perform well over the next 12 months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company is planning roughly $23 billion in AI-related capital spending in 2026, betting heavily on computing power to fuel its next phase of growth.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nMost of that money will go toward the infrastructure behind Doubao, ByteDance's fast-growing AI assistant, along with tools that power advertising and content recommendations. A key part of the plan is a trial of about 20,000 Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) H200 chips, a roughly $400 million investment that would give ByteDance access to top-tier AI hardware at a time when such supply is tightly controlled. Reports suggest more than half of the budget could be dedicated just to AI processors.\nThat spending still trails U.S. giants like Meta ( NASDAQ:META ) and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ), but ByteDance's private status gives it flexibility to play the long game. Doubao's rapid rise in China shows why the company is leaning in.\nWhy it matters: ByteDance is signaling that AI is now core to its business, not an experiment, and it is willing to spend aggressively to stay ahead.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?",

The order is part of an examination into whether Meta misused its strong market position by barring other messaging services.The Italian Antitrust Authority said Meta's contractual conditions might limit AI chatbot services market output, market access or technical development and hurt consumers and innovation.Meta called the decision fundamentally flawed, claiming that third-party chatbot integrations overburden unsupported infrastructure. Company plans to appeal the verdict.The AGCM began investigating WhatsApp in July and added new business platform rules in November. To enforce Meta consistently, the regulator is working with the European Commission, which opened a parallel probe last month.Europe's more harsh regulatory attitude against giant U.S. tech corporations contrasts with the US's more liberal approach.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Billionaires Buy 2 Trillion-Dollar AI Stocks Hand Over Fist Ahead of 2026\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points A few hedge fund managers with impressive track records bought shares of Alphabet and Meta Platforms in the third quarter.\nMeta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve engagement and ad conversion rates across its social media properties.\nAlphabet is monetizing artificial intelligence across its digital advertising and cloud computing businesses.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have advanced 13% year to date, bringing its market value to $1.6 trillion. Meanwhile, shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) have advanced 64%, bringing the company's market value to $3.7 trillion. Three top hedge fund managers bought both stocks in the third quarter.\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management added 793,500 shares of Meta Platforms and 2.2 million shares of Alphabet. Both stocks rank among his top 10 holdings.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors added 1.4 million shares of Meta Platforms and 2 million shares of Alphabet. Both stocks rank among his top 10 holdings.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management added 355,000 shares of Meta Platforms and 7.2 million shares of Alphabet. Both stocks rank among his top three holdings.\n\nImportantly, all three hedge fund managers handily outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the past three years, which makes them good sources of inspiration. But the trades mentioned took place in the third quarter, which ended several months ago. Here's a more current look at Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n1. Meta Platforms Meta has a strong presence in two industries: digital advertising and smart glasses. It owns three of the four most popular social media networks , which lets it collect user data and target media content. That advantage has made Meta the second-largest ad tech company in the world. But the company has also taken an early lead in the nascent smart glasses market.\n\nJPMorgan Chase analyst Dough Anmuth recently wrote, \"Meta is in rarified air across the combination of scale, growth, and profitability, as the company's massive reach and engagement continue to drive network effects, and its targeting abilities provide significant value to advertisers.\"\nMeta is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) -- from custom semiconductors to proprietary large language models -- to strengthen that network effect by boosting engagement and ad conversion rates across its social media properties. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts, \"Our AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant content,\" leading to more time spent on Instagram, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms is also developing a superintelligence system to integrate with its augmented reality smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says glasses will be our \"primary computing devices\" in the future. If he is correct, Meta -- which accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025 -- could become a consumer electronics giant in the 2030s.\n\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look quite reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842 per share. That implies 27% upside from its current share price of $661.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet is the largest ad tech company in the world because of its ability to engage consumers with Google Search and YouTube. The company is leaning on AI to better monetize those web properties. AI Overviews and AI Mode have increased query volume on Google Search, and generative AI tools are helping YouTube influencers create, edit, and optimize content.\n\nAlphabet has also developed an application called Gemini, a generative AI assistant built on a family of large language models of the same name. Gemini now has over 650 million monthly active users, and it ranks as the second most popular AI assistant behind ChatGPT. Alphabet does not sell ad inventory on the platform yet, but the company can certainly pull that lever in the future.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's Google Cloud is the third largest public cloud by infrastructure and platform services spending, and it gained 2 percentage points of market share in the last two years due. Consultancy Gartner recently ranked Google as the most capable cloud platform for AI application development, and Forrester Research ranked it as a leader in LLMs.\nThat praise suggests further market share gains are likely. Indeed, total cloud sales increased 34% in the third quarter, the second consecutive acceleration, driven by strong demand for Google's custom AI chips (called TPUs) and generative AI models. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate Google Cloud revenue growth will accelerate to 44% in 2026.\n\nWall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 15% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look tolerable. Among 75 analysts, Alphabet has a median target price of $330 per share. That implies 6% upside from its current share price of $310. Investors can buy a small position today if they feel so inclined, but I think Meta is the more attractive of the two stocks.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "Apple spent 2025 setting itself up for the future — and its biggest moves weren't about AI\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nSSNLF\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Apple ( AAPL ). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

In that case, the judge ruled that it was legal for Anthropic and similar AI companies to train on pirated copies of books, but that it was not legal to pirate the books in the first place.\n\nWhile eligible writers can receive about $3,000 from the $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement, some authors were dissatisfied with that resolution — it doesn’t hold AI companies accountable for the actual act of using stolen books to train their models, which generate billions of dollars in revenue.\nAccording to the new lawsuit, the plaintiffs say that the proposed Anthropic settlement “seems to serve [the AI companies], not creators.”\n“LLM companies should not be able to so easily extinguish thousands upon thousands of high-value claims at bargain-basement rates, eliding what should be the true cost of their massive willful infringement,” the lawsuit says.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "An X-Ray View of the Magnificent Seven\n\nJohn Dorfman\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:38 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBy John Dorfman December 22, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate)\nFor the past three years, a huge share of the stock market's action has been in the Magnificent Seven , a small group of super-successful, super-popular stocks.\nThere are signs of fatigue in this leadership group. But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

      "Content": "Is Meta Stock a Buy After Its AI Spending Spree?\n\nLyle Daly, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:21 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms has invested heavily in AI and plans to ramp up spending even more in 2026.\nThese AI investments have drawn comparisons to Meta's costly metaverse venture.\nThe key difference is that Meta's AI spending is already driving growth for its ad business.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) plummeted after its third-quarter earnings report, largely due to the company's significant artificial intelligence (AI) spending -- and plans to spend even more in 2026. From Oct. 29 to Nov. 20, Meta's share price fell 22%, from $752 to less than $600.\nInvestors are concerned that AI will become the next metaverse , which has cost Meta over $70 billion since 2021. However, there's a crucial point that many are overlooking.\nMeta's AI investments are paying off The metaverse has been a money pit so far, and there's a good chance it will never pay off in a meaningful way. AI, on the other hand, is already providing legitimate value for Meta. The social media company has integrated AI tools into its ad products, enabling companies to optimize ad designs, set up automated rules that pause or boost ads based on performance, and receive AI-powered ad insights.\n\nThese tools have contributed to better ad engagement, higher prices, and more money for Meta. Ad impressions were up 14% year over year in the third quarter of 2025, and the average price per ad increased by 10% year over year. Revenue for the first three quarters of the year was $42.3 billion (a 16% year-over-year increase), $47.5 billion (a 22% increase), and $51.2 billion (a 26% increase).\nWith $44.8 billion in trailing free cash flow (FCF), Meta can afford to make substantial investments in AI. While the metaverse flashbacks are understandable, AI spending could be a winning move for Meta. I still consider the company a buy, and I've been picking up shares during the dip.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Google started the year behind in the AI race. It ended 2025 on top.\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:03 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nCRM\n\nGoogle ( GOOG , GOOGL ) entered 2025 in a difficult position. While its stock price rose 36% in 2024, the company was still largely perceived by Wall Street as playing second (or third) fiddle to OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) in the AI race.\nFast-forward to today, and Google is stealing the show, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a \"code red\" emergency as the company works to match Google's latest Gemini 3 AI models. It's an interesting twist, given that Google declared its own code red after ChatGPT hit the market in 2022.\n\nGoogle is also catching up to OpenAI in the key monthly active user (MAU) metric.\nThen there are Google chip wins. In October, Claude developer Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) announced it was expanding its plan to use Google's AI chips, including using up to 1 million processors , to power its AI software.\nGoogle is also in talks to provide its chips to Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta ( META ) to run its AI products, according to The Information .\nIt all added up to a strong 2025 for the search giant, setting it up for continued success in the year ahead.\n\"Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in CY26,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a Dec. 11 investor note.\n\"Google is in the strongest position when it comes to a fully integrated AI stack,\" he wrote. \"Gemini is a leading model, its user base is expanding faster than OpenAI's, Search is integrating AI effectively with ads reportedly on the way, and [Google Cloud Platform] continues to hold its ground in the infrastructure buildout cycle.\"\n\nGoogle's AI wins pile up Google counts its AI revenue as part of its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) business. According to the company, that has given GCP a significant boost. In Q3, Google said its GCP revenue grew 34% year over year to $15.1 billion . It rose 32% in the prior quarter.\nThe number of new customers to the GCP jumped 34%.\n\n\"Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.\nAccording to Pichai, Google signed more deals worth more than $1 billion in its third quarter than it did in the previous two years combined. More than 70% of the company's existing cloud customers are using its AI services, he added.\nThe company has also more deeply intertwined its AI capabilities with Google Search, launching its ChatGPT-like AI Mode for all US users in May at the Google I/O conference and dropping ads into AI Overviews in search.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle has also managed to win over social media users with its Nano Banana AI image app, which went viral in August. Then came the biggest bomb: Gemini 3.\nAnnounced in November , Gemini 3 immediately won praise from users, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who said he was ditching ChatGPT after using the app for Gemini 3.\n\nGemini 3 sent shockwaves through the AI industry, unseating GPT-5.1 as the leading AI model across several categories.\nGoogle's user base is also growing. According to TD Cowen's John Blackledge, a survey of roughly 2,500 US consumers found that Gemini's MAU penetration ramped faster than ChatGPT's from July to October.\nGemini MAU penetration was 24% in July and climbed to 26% in October. Google's AI Mode also improved from 18% to 19%. ChatGPT, however, saw its MAU penetration decline from 36% to 35% in the same time period.\n\nMarket intelligence firm Sensor Tower says that both apps continue to see significant growth, with global MAU up 180% and 125% for ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively. But like TD Cowen, Sensor Tower found that ChatGPT's MAU grew roughly 15% between August and December. Gemini was up 30%, thanks in part to its Nano Banana image editing app.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that Gemini is also available on all newer Android devices, making it far easier to access than ChatGPT, which requires users to navigate to a website or download the ChatGPT app.\nGoogle's other beats AI wasn't the only bright spot for Google in 2025. While the company lost its second antitrust case in April, with a judge finding it holds an illegal monopoly through its online advertising business, its legal issues weren't all bad.\nIn September, a judge declined to force Google to give up its Chrome browser after he found the company holds an illegal monopoly over the search market.\nThe judge also allowed Google to continue to make payments to \"distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or GenAI products.\"\nThat means the company can continue to pay Apple upwards of $20 billion a year to make Google Search the default search option on its iPhone and other devices.\n\nOutside of its legal dramas, Google has also made major strides with self-driving car company Waymo. The firm expanded its availability to other cities — including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando — and began offering freeway driving around San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\nGoogle also showed off its prototype smart glasses and a new Samsung VR headset, both of which use software based on a version of Android called Android XR, which was developed by Google and Samsung.\nLook for that and more in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Elon Musk’s Net Worth Up $215 Billion in 2025\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk’s net worth is up by $215 billion this year to $647 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That increase is almost as much as the total net worth of the sixth-richest man in the world. That is, Mark Zuckerberg, who is the founder and CEO of Meta, has a net worth of $234 billion. Another estimate from Forbes puts Musk’s net worth above $700 billion. The measurements from the two sources rarely match exactly.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk’s net worth is up sharply this year to at least $647 billion.\nThere is speculation that his net worth could top $1 trillion.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThere are several reasons for the Musk wealth increase. There is speculation that Musk’s net worth will top $1 trillion when SpaceX, which he founded and of which he is the largest shareholder, goes public next year with an estimated valuation of $800 billion or more. His exact ownership is 43%. However, his voting share is 79%.\nTesla’s stock is up 21% this year. Its market cap is $1.63 trillion. Musk owns over 15% of Tesla, and a new pay package could take that figure much higher. A fight in the courts over a stock award turned out to be in Musk’s favor two days ago. The package was worth $139 billion. (One argument that Musk’s net worth is lower than most estimates is that the eventual stock option values cannot be valued on the day they are given.) Musk also has a pay package worth about $1 trillion, but he has 10 years of hurdles to clear before he makes that.\n\nxAI is a merger of social media company X and xAI, one of the world’s largest artificial intelligence companies. At the time of the transaction, in March, X was valued at $33 billion ($45 billion, less its $12 billion in debt) and xAI at $80 billion. By some estimates, Musk owns about half of xAI, which is in a race with OpenAI and the AI arms of several public companies, including Alphabet.\nThe reason the Bloomberg figure can only be an estimate is that the value of private companies is hard to peg.\nRising From the Ashes Musk’s increase in net worth is something of a phoenix rising from the ashes. Tesla stock dropped from just below $400 a share at the start of 2025 to $220 in April. Musk’s rocky relationship with President Trump and a decline in Tesla sales were blamed for that. However, the shares have recovered to over $485 apiece.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Musk has said Tesla is much closer to having a fully autonomous vehicle. If these cars go on sale to the general public, Musk’s net worth is likely to soar again.\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\n\nAmin Ayan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIBIT\n\nBLK\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nBlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025, ranking the product alongside Treasury bills and US mega-cap technology stocks.\nKey Takeaways:\nBlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech.\nIBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\nThe fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025.\nThe performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand.\n\nNate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.\nThe latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival.\nBlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could Meta Platforms Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is sparing no expense to achieve personal AI superintelligence.\nWhat matters most to Meta's long-term success is how AI can bolster user engagement, as well as ad capabilities for customers.\nThe stock is a compelling buying opportunity today, but it's not going to provide life-changing returns.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nSince its initial public offering in May 2012, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , formerly called Facebook, has seen its share price rise 1,640% (as of Dec. 19). That means that had you invested $58,000 in the business at the time it hit the public markets, you'd have $1 million today. That's a great gain in less than 14 years.\nThese days, the investment community isn't doubting how wonderful a company this is. Meta is one of the most dominant technology enterprises in the world, with impressive growth and profitability . And it continues to operate at a high level.\nIf you've been watching the \" Magnificent Seven \" stock from the sidelines, you're probably wondering what the future will bring. Could Meta Platforms help you become a millionaire?\nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg views AI as a big opportunity We are in the middle of what could shape up to be one of the major technological shifts in history. Companies are scrambling to basically go all-in on artificial intelligence (AI). Like other tech giants, Meta is not hesitating to spend on its AI efforts. The business is projecting $70 billion to $72 billion of capital expenditures in 2025, which \"will be notably larger in 2026,\" according to CFO Susan Li. The money will go toward technical infrastructure.\n\nMeta also spent heavily to assemble an AI all-star team earlier this year to help create Meta Superintelligence Labs, bringing on top scientists and researchers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's objective is to achieve personal superintelligence, essentially being a tool for people to achieve and do more.\nThe strategic rationale makes sense. Meta must spend copious amounts of capital or it will risk falling behind in the AI race. At the end of the day, what matters most for this business is how AI will drive more users and engagement on its apps, as well as higher ad spend from ad customers.\nWhen it comes to digital advertising, Meta is performing extremely well. Ad revenue increased 26% year over year during the third quarter. Zuckerberg believes AI will expand the total addressable market for digital ads.\n\n\"I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today,\" he said on the Q1 2025 earnings call. That's if Meta can continue to make progress on improving ad capabilities for its customers. Investors will surely want to see a positive long-term impact on earnings and free cash flow from this huge AI focus.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms shares are worth owning If you say that Meta is one of the best businesses on Earth, you wouldn't find many people who disagree with you. The company's defining attribute is the presence of unbelievably powerful network effects . During the third quarter, its family of apps counted an astonishing 3.54 billion daily active users. People want to use these platforms because everyone they know is using them. And with more users, the platforms improve over time.\n\nMeta's unrivaled reach, as exemplified by its immense user base, might be enough of a reason for investors to consider owning shares. When a network effect has become this robust, it's incredibly difficult (maybe even impossible) to disrupt.\nTo be fair, though, this doesn't mean rival social media platforms can't enter the mix. Think about Snap or TikTok. This shows that competition for attention is fierce. However, Meta can observe certain features and tactics that are working well for its peers and immediately integrate those into its own apps, with broad adoption occurring instantly. This helps it maintain such a dominant position.\nThe business should be on every investor's watch list. The stock could do well over the next five or 10 years, thanks to a compelling valuation and strong earnings growth. But Meta isn't some small, early-stage company whose stock is going to skyrocket, so unless you have a six-figure sum to invest today, this isn't a millionaire-maker opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?
