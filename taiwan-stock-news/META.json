As a major backer of the AI tools developers use, Meta is collaborating with Google and gaining greater access to Google's chip infrastructure.\nGoogle plans to use this setup both for its own AI services and for cloud customers.\nReducing Reliance On Nvidia Infrastructure The move adds pressure to Nvidia as competition in AI hardware intensifies.\nNvidia recently said its widely discussed $100 billion potential deal with OpenAI remains nonbinding and emphasized that its sales outlook does not depend on that agreement.\nThe company continues to point to the strength of its full AI stack as its core advantage.\n\nSee Also: The AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nNvidia became the first company to top the $4.5 trillion market cap in October 2025, topping the likes of Apple Inc.

      "Content": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company May Now Be Winning the AI War\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:52 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After ChatGPT took some of its search traffic, Alphabet rebounded by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode.\nAlphabet's Gemini 3 is considered a leading LLM.\nManagement will increase the tech giant's capital expenditures in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIt's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world in significant ways, and the major hyperscalers are all investing hundreds of billions of dollars in their efforts to capitalize on the trend. Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Meta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n\nLuke Juricic\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:49 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is readying a technological offensive for 2026, developing a suite of next-generation artificial intelligence models designed to challenge the dominance of OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.\nAccording to the Thursday report from WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter, the social media giant is working on a high-stakes image and video-focused AI model code-named \"Mango.\" Concurrently, the company is developing \"Avocado,\" its next major text-based large language model (LLM).\n\nThe new roadmap was reportedly detailed during an internal Q&A on Thursday featuring Meta’s Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox. The models are expected to release in the first half of 2026, signaling a long-term play to move beyond the incremental updates of the current Llama family.\nThe development of Mango and Avocado represents the first major output from Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a specialized division created after a major restructuring this past summer. To lead the group, CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally orchestrated high-profile recruiting efforts, poaching more than 20 researchers from OpenAI and hiring Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, to oversee the effort.\nThe move underscores Zuckerberg’s willingness to spend aggressively to close the gap with rivals. As part of the transition, Meta reportedly invested over $14 billion to acquire a near-majority stake in Scale AI, cementing Wang’s role as the primary architect of Meta’s post-Llama strategy.\n\nDuring the internal session, Wang emphasized that Avocado will focus heavily on advanced coding capabilities, a traditional weak point for previous Meta models compared to competitors.\nMore ambitiously, Wang noted that Meta is in the early stages of developing \"world models.\" Unlike current LLMs that predict the next word in a sequence, world models aim to understand physical reality by processing vast amounts of visual information.\nMeta stock remained relatively flat in after-hours trade following the WSJ report, though shares rose 2.3% during trading hours.\nRelated articles\nMeta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta Platforms (META) Laps the Stock Market: Here's Why\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nMeta Platforms (META) closed the most recent trading day at $664.45, moving +2.3% from the previous trading session. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.79% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.38%.\nThe stock of social media company has risen by 10.02% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.85% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Meta Platforms in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $8.15, signifying a 1.62% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $58.37 billion, indicating a 20.63% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $23.43 per share and revenue of $198.75 billion. These totals would mark changes of -1.8% and +20.82%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.16% higher. Meta Platforms is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Meta Platforms has a Forward P/E ratio of 27.72 right now. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 28.76 of its industry.\n\nInvestors should also note that META has a PEG ratio of 1.68 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. META's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.87 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 60, this industry ranks in the top 25% of all industries, numbering over 250.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

By outperforming established approaches from Meta, DeepMind-affiliated researchers, and Harvard, Corti's new Gradient Interaction Modification (GIM) technique proves that specialized labs can lead in fundamental AI research - the kind that shapes how the entire industry builds, understands, and deploys intelligent systems\nThe \"surgical\" shift\nAs models aspire to reach AGI-level complexity, the industry is realizing the need to sharpen comprehension - we cannot control what we cannot see. The focus is shifting from simply scaling parameters to understanding the mechanisms behind them.\n\n\"Until now, much of AI development has been empirical rather than mechanistic - we train models and observe results, but struggle to understand why they work,\" said Lars Maaløe, Co-Founder and CTO at Corti . \"GIM reveals the internal logic that standard tools miss, turning model improvement from trial-and-error into precision engineering.\"\nThe technical breakthrough\nTraditional interpretability methods test neurons in isolation - like testing light switches one at a time. However, if the light only turns off when all switches are flipped, testing them individually falsely suggests that neither switch matters.\nGIM solves this by analyzing how components interact when changed simultaneously, revealing the actual circuits driving behavior rather than backup mechanisms. This enables researchers to:\n\nPinpoint Causality: Identify the specific circuits responsible for outputs, not just correlated signals.\nDebug Surgically: Trace failures like hallucinations to their root cause.\nScale Efficiently: Run deep analysis on production models in seconds - critical for meeting regulatory requirements like the EU AI Act (Article 13) .\nHigher standards for the highest stakes\nHealthcare AI demands higher explainability standards than consumer applications. When models influence clinical decisions, institutions need forensic-level precision to trace reasoning and validate safety - not just aggregate accuracy.\n\nStory Continues\n\"In healthcare, we don't have the luxury of 'good enough' - we need to know exactly why a model made a specific decision,\" said Andreas Cleve, Co-Founder and CEO of Corti . \"High-stakes verticals require surgical precision. We built GIM because we needed it for our own clinical infrastructure, but the result is a tool that accelerates progress for the entire field.\"\n\nThis addresses a problem that's becoming universal. As transparency requirements expand across finance, autonomous systems, and government services, the methods necessary for clinical deployment today are becoming table stakes for all regulated AI tomorrow.\nCorti has released GIM as open source, making the method immediately available to researchers, developers, and organizations worldwide. Developers can access the implementation through a Python package here .\nAbout Corti\nCorti is a research and development company that specializes in state-of-the-art AI foundation models and infrastructure for healthcare. Its mission is to eliminate administrative hurdles in healthcare and life sciences and to bring expert-level reasoning to every corner of the globe - driving down costs and improving quality of care through purpose-built AI models you can trust.\nCorti's models integrate seamlessly into any healthcare application through Corti's SDKs and APIs, enabling vendors, providers, and payers to leverage safe, cutting-edge AI across the entire care journey.\nwww.corti.ai\nCONTACT: press@corti.ai\nView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/corti-unlocks-surgical-ai-improvement-outperforming-big-tech-in-interpretability-benchmark-302646275.html\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company\n\nSamantha Dorisca\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nDarrell Spencer is shattering various glass ceilings.\nThe Chicago native credits his hustling nature to his parents. His mother works as a postmaster for the United States Postal Service. His father worked for the Chicago Police Department and rose through the ranks to become a commander before retiring. His father also has a real estate portfolio, which was an additional stream of revenue for the family and was an early sign for Spencer that there are other financial paths to follow outside the confines of corporate America.\n\nWorking In Big Tech After completing a bachelor’s in economics at Connecticut College on a full-tuition national scholarship, Spencer got a job in finance but later pivoted into big tech. He has worked at Facebook, Google, Pinterest, and LinkedIn within their customer sales department in advertising, he told AFROTECH. Still, he felt called to entrepreneurship.\n“I helped them generate millions of dollars in revenue through a strategy across each different platform at each company that I was at,” he shared. “Did really well there. However, I just didn’t feel fulfilled. I woke up every day feeling just like it was routine. And it got to a point where I was very dissatisfied with the trajectory of my life. I felt as if there was more in life that I had to do. And growing up, I’ve always known that I wanted to do something in business … I just never knew what I wanted to do, but I’ve always known I wanted to create.”\n\nLeap Into Entrepreneurship In 2021, Spencer’s first swing as a founder was with Kings Crowning, which offered a satin-lined cap that was a functional, stylish, alternative bonnet for men. The business launched from a storage unit and grew into a multimillion-dollar company, leading him to become a first-generation CEO and millionaire by the time he was 27 years old, per Business Insider.\n\nCrowned Skin Fast forward to March 2024, and Spencer is on to his next brainchild, Crowned Skin, a science-backed skincare and grooming brand for men. The inspiration for the company came from a place of frustration while walking down retail aisles, seeing little representation and few innovative products for men in these categories, he told AFROTECH\n.\nSpencer made an upfront investment of between $10,000 and $15,000 into Crowned Skin with the income generated from King’s Crowning, coupled with real estate investments. These funds were recouped within a few months, he recalled. The investment gave him the financial freedom to create products, establish warehousing, and fund advertising.\n“I just wanted to create products that made men feel seen and confident,” Spencer explained. “I think men across the board, there’s this stigma when it comes down to men’s beauty, men’s grooming. It’s this hush topic that men don’t feel comfortable talking about.”\n\nStory Continues\nCrowned Skin offers body butter, cologne, and body oil in a range of scents, including its newest scent, Empire.\nSpencer has been intentional with growing the company to be profitable and self-sustaining. Strategic decisions, such as pivoting early in Crowned Skin’s marketing messaging, have helped him guide the company towards those goals. Working at various big tech companies as an ads manager allowed him to understand the power of attention and how to retain it.\n\nThis knowledge influenced how the brand positioned its products. Spencer showed the functionality of the products, which include ultra-moisturizing and healing properties; aligned with what would resonate with men, such as the allure of certain scents; and demonstrated the products’ efficiency, as they could cut morning routines in half by functioning as a two-in-one product.\n“We ended up running with those street marketing pieces. And then we learned that through creative messaging, through compelling five- to ten-second ad content around that messaging, that’s what really compelled. That’s what really propelled the business forward very, very fast,” he acknowledged.\n“So then at that point, we were getting our revenue shot up. The business was funding itself. We were very profitable. We were mindful of our return on ad spend, and we were able to scale up as more funds came in. And the next thing we knew, at that point, we really didn’t need any outside investments,” he added. “We didn’t need any other injections of capital … We chose to scale intentionally and scale when revenue came in.”\n\nRevenue Crowned Skin earned $4 million in revenue within its first year and is now a multi-million-dollar company, Spencer confirmed to AFROTECH\n. This feat is aided by strong teams across financial, fulfillment, product development, and manufacturing. Additionally, e-commerce has remained a major component of Crowned Skin’s success through Amazon and TikTok Shop, which have particularly helped boost revenue for the venture.\n“If you want to be a highly competitive and successful brand and company in today’s age, you need to diversify, be on every e-commerce channel across the board, and be your best at all of them. TikTok Shop has been huge. TikTok shop is becoming one of our biggest revenue channels. And the way that you can work with affiliates and really seed samples and fuel your company through affiliates, but also the age of live selling on TikTok, we’re coming into a whole new age of e-commerce marketing,” Spencer explained.\nTikTok Shop has become a six-figure-a-month channel for the company. Crowned Skin also makes history as the first Black male-founded skincare company to reach the #2 spot on TikTok Shop, according to information shared with AFROTECH\n.\n“I get to really be a forward-thinking leader in this space as a Black man in an underrepresented category where there’s not many other Black males doing this … This all was self-taught … Representation is everything for me because I think there’s so many other Black men out there that are in that similar position, but honestly, fear might stunt them. I’m really proud that I get to really create this amazing company and showcase all that you can do as a Black man. If you truly put your head down, it really works,” Spencer explained.\n\nFirst Retail Partnership The overarching goal is to position Crowned Skin as a one-stop shop for men’s grooming. There are currently various products in research and development, including body washes and deodorants, Spencer told AFROTECH\n. It will also soon gain greater visibility following its first-ever retail partnership with Walmart.com. There are plans to later expand regionally, then nationally on store shelves, Spencer shared.\nSpencer also stated that he intends to raise a Series A, likely in 2026, to scale the company globally.\n\n“I want Crowned Skin to be around for years and years, and I want it to last even when I’m not here. I want this to be a legacy company … I want global access … That’ll be an amazing opportunity for us to scale to even more heights, bring on an amazing partner or partners right in this space that have done it, that have scaled companies to nine, 10 figures, and that can really position Crowned Skin to be one of the most dominating forces in men’s grooming,” he expressed.\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

With shareholders of each company expected to own approximately 50% of the merged entity, the transaction is expected to close in mid-2026, subject to approvals.\nFollowing the announcement, Trump Media shares are surging 37% in early trading today as the merger aims to create one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies. It would position the combined firm to build utility-scale fusion power plants, with the first one beginning construction next year. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs.\n\nTruth Social's Limited Reach Truth Social was launched in 2022 as an alternative platform emphasizing free expression, but has struggled to achieve broad market traction because of its association with President Trump -- Barron's reports he indirectly owns about 115 million shares of the company. Instead, the app primarily attracts users aligned with his political base, limiting its appeal beyond that demographic.\n\nReports indicate Truth Social has far fewer active users compared to established platforms such as Meta Platforms ' ( NASDAQ:META ) Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- which collectively boast billions of monthly active users worldwide -- and X, which also commands hundreds of millions of users. Truth Social's user base remains significantly smaller, with estimates placing it in the low millions, reflecting challenges in expanding beyond its core audience.\nFusion: Energy's Chimera TAE Technologies was founded in 1998 and has pursued nuclear fusion -- a process mimicking the sun's energy production -- for over 25 years. Fusion is often called the energy industry's holy grail due to its potential for abundant, clean power without long-term radioactive waste, unlike traditional nuclear fission.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has built and operated five experimental reactors, raising more than $1.3 billion from investors, including Google and Chevron ( NYSE:CVX ). The company now plans to advance to utility-scale operations, aiming to commence construction on its first commercial plant in 2026. This step represents a significant escalation from research prototypes to power generation capable of supplying electricity to the grid.\n\nDespite progress, achieving commercial fusion remains elusive globally, with no operating plants producing net energy for the grid. TAE's ambition to deploy utility-scale facilities faces substantial technical and financial challenges. Although the company has demonstrated advancements in reactor design, transitioning to reliable, cost-effective power production is fraught with hurdles.\nKey Takeaways TAE's timeline for a utility-scale plant beginning next year appears highly ambitious, requiring not only technical breakthroughs but also extensive regulatory approvals from bodies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy.\nTrump Media is seeking to leverage growing energy demands from artificial intelligence data centers, where fusion could theoretically provide vast power. However, combining a social media operation with cutting-edge fusion research represents a sharp divergence from core businesses for both entities. It reeks of opportunistic grandstanding by attempting to capitalize on the hot topic of AI's energy demands, much like its previous venture into the crypto world.\n\nGiven fusion's history of overpromising and delay -- and the merger's execution risks -- the deal carries a high probability of complications, setbacks, and failure. Investors should avoid buying into the hype. If TAE and Trump Media can actually succeed in the effort, there will be plenty of opportunity to buy in afterward.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nMatt Hussey,Jason Nelson\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:40 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMETA\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts —self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps , that run without banks, governments, or big tech.\n\nWhen programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain —not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games , digital art , and assets worth billions.\nUltimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.\nThis guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.\nSmart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.\nSmart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.\n\nWho Invented Ethereum? Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.\n\nDevelopment of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nA crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.\n\nThe network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.\nThe switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work\nThis shift, known as “ The Merge ,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.\nBlocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhat applications have been built on Ethereum? 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.\n📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.\n💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.\n💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.\n💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.\n🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.\n\nTimeline: Major milestones in Ethereum Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.\nMid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.\nJuly 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.\nSeptember 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.\nMarch 2016: Homestead upgrade improves protocol security and usability.\nApril 2016: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, launches via crowdsale.\nJune 2016: Hackers exploit The DAO and drain roughly $50 million in Ether. Community votes to hard-fork, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\nOctober 2017: Byzantium hard fork enhances performance, privacy, and sets the stage for Proof-of-Stake.\nDecember 2017: CryptoKitties and CryptoPunk NFTs go viral, stressing network capacity and highlighting scalability issues.\nJanuary 2018: ERC-721 NFT standard is introduced, enabling unique digital assets.\nDecember 2020: Beacon Chain launches, beginning Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake.\nMarch 2020: Visa begins settling USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin transactions using Ethereum.\nApril 2021: Berlin hard fork reduces gas costs.\nAugust 2021: London hard fork activates EIP-1559 ; introduces fee burning, reducing inflation.\nSeptember 15, 2022: “The Merge” transitions Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, cutting energy use by more than 99 percent.\nApril 12, 2023: The Shanghai upgrade enables withdrawal of staked Ether from the Beacon Chain.\nMarch 13, 2024: The Dencun upgrade introduces proto-danksharding, a step toward reducing costs and increasing scalability.\nMay 7, 2025: The Pectra upgrade, combining Prague and Electra updates, aims to expand staking flexibility and improve Ethereum’s efficiency.\nDecember 3, 2025: The Fusaka upgrade introduces changes to Ethereum's data availability and block capacity.\n\nEthereum and DAOs One of Ethereum’s most radical innovations was the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes . Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.\nThe first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack , but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.\n\nWhat Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?\nSince then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon , to investment collectives like Syndicate , and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO , which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.\nSupporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.\nA network tested by crisis If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.\nEthereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.\nThe community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nEthereum and the NFT boom Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.\nThe breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties , CryptoPunks , and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\nBy 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million , and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.\nEthereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nThe race to scale Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.\nTo address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 . The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.\n\nVitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'\nEthereum and the Web3 vision Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.\n\nBut competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana , Cardano , and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.\nEthereum and privacy In 2025, privacy has become a key focus of the Ethereum project. In November, Vitalik Buterin stated that \"Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene,\" building on a narrative in which he framed it as a fundamental requirement for digital systems such as blockchain platforms.\nEthereum Foundation Launches New Cluster Focused on Privacy\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has followed suit, launching a privacy cluster in October 2025 that includes 47 researchers, coordinators and cryptographers. The Foundation also launched Kohaku, a \"privacy-first\" toolkit for Ethereum, alongside a browser wallet and SDK. Upon its launch, Buterin commented that \"Full-stack privacy and security are first-class priorities in Ethereum.\"\nA decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.\nWhat’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

JPMorgan's 2026 outlook, backed by new CEO survey data, suggests markets are now recalibrating expectations — shifting focus from AI adoption to whether it actually delivers profits.\nGenAI Fell Short Of CEO Expectations PwC's latest global CEO survey, covering more than 4,700 executives across 109 countries, shows a clear expectation gap. While over 40% of CEOs entered 2025 expecting GenAI to boost revenue and nearly half anticipated a lift in profitability, only about one-third reported meaningful gains in either metric by year-end. Efficiency improvements were more visible, but even those undershot initial expectations.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nJPMorgan's interpretation isn't that AI spending was misplaced — it's that monetization arrived slower than anticipated. Adoption moved quickly, but translating that into top-line and margin expansion proved harder than forecasts implied.\nFrom Experimentation To ROI Discipline That gap is now changing behavior. JPMorgan notes that boards and CFOs are pressing harder on return on investment, favoring projects with clearer financial outcomes over open-ended experimentation. Growth alone is no longer enough; it needs to come with margin discipline.\nAs a result, valuation frameworks are tightening. Metrics like the Rule of 40 — and JPMorgan's stricter Rule of X — are reasserting themselves as filters rather than afterthoughts.\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nWhy 2026 Will Look Different The implication for 2026 is straightforward.

      "Content": "Charlie Munger Said, 'Find A Way To Get Your Hands On $100,000' Even If It Means Walking Everywhere — The Magic Number If You Want To Be Rich\n\nJeannine Mancini\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nCharlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

Dublin already hosts the European hubs of major technology groups such as Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) and ByteDance's TikTok, and industry observers suggest the current AI boom could reinforce the city's long-standing ties to US technology firms. Anthropic declined to comment on its specific leasing plans but said it is expanding rapidly, with existing European offices in London, Paris, Zurich and Munich, and has described EMEA as its fastest-growing region in a November blog post.\n\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), also declined to discuss specific property plans, but said it employs about 60 people in Ireland and expects to continue adding staff in 2026. The company began its Dublin operations in 2023 and is advertising roles including software engineers and trust and safety analysts, while also planning to increase the size of its London office.

      "Content": "Trump Media is merging with fusion power company TAE Technologies in $6B+ deal\n\nTim De Chant, Amanda Silberling\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies , a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.\nThe all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.\n\nTMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch , the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”\nTMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.\nTruth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.\n\nTMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.\nBut the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.\nCurrently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion , are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.\n\nIf one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.\n\nOver the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.\nIn the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.\nAfter the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 18)\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:50 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThis year, one of the better performers among the Magnificent 7 had been Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ: META ). But its third-quarter earnings report raised investor concerns about the company’s massive capital spending on artificial intelligence initiatives. In addition, Meta says it plans to make significant cuts to the budget of its Reality Labs metaverse division in the coming year. The stock is down 13.6% since the quarterly report was released.\n\nStrong quarterly reports earlier this year (despite a tax charge) had lent credence to the claim that Meta would continue to outshine its competitors over the next year. The share price hit an all-time high of $796.25 back in August. Due to the recent pullback, the stock is up 4.9% year over year, underperforming the broader market. Furthermore, the near-term future of the economy is uncertain—just like the markets themselves—and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a controversial figure. Certainly, Zuckerberg's sudden shift to the metaverse and brand name change to Meta Platforms raised a few eyebrows several years ago.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Meta Platforms Inc.’s ( NASDAQ: META ) AI push has been a key driver for the company in 2025, with integrations coming across numerous platforms, which is fueling engagement and increasing ad sales.\nDespite economic cloudiness, Meta announced that its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) estimate increased significantly, much of which will be allocated to AI project development and integration.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNow, the Meta Platforms CEO is shifting the company's focus and riding a powerful, bullish trend. Against this complex backdrop with many moving parts, investors should consider the wide range of Meta stock price targets and formulate a strategy for all possible outcomes. To help, 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis. Let's jump in.\nWhy Invest in Meta Platforms? Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room. Investors should not rely on Meta Platforms' Reality Labs metaverse business to drive the company's near-term future growth. In Q3 2025, Reality Labs generated $470 million in revenue, up from $370 million in revenue in the prior quarter. However, during that same time frame, Reality Labs recorded a loss from operations of $4.43 billion.\n\nFortunately, it appears that the CEO's attention has turned to a different tech field lately. In particular, Zuckerberg seems to expect AI to be Meta Platforms' key driver going forward. AI integrations into Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp could provide an economic moat for Meta Platforms if new features translate to greater user engagement. WhatsApp, in particular, has seen notable growth with more than 3 billion monthly users now.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta's AI focus evidently helped the company succeed in the third quarter of the year despite losses in its metaverse business. Impressively, Meta Platforms grew its revenue 26% year over year to $51.2 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus call for $49.5 billion. Furthermore, excluding a one-time tax charge, the company's earnings per share (EPS) surged 20% to $7.25, easily outpacing the analysts' consensus estimate of $6.74.\n\nThere's no doubt that Zuckerberg is all-in on the AI revolution now. He envisions a future in which AI will be used for \"a lot\" of \"social tasks.\" And he believes it's \"really compelling\" that AI will \"get to know you better and better.\" Some reporters have expressed skepticism of an AI-infused future. Yet, if Meta Platforms can parlay machine learning into profits, investors shouldn't dismiss the growth potential of Meta stock.\nAnother key driver for Meta Platforms is its Threads short-form messaging platform. Granted, Threads is still playing catch-up to the popular X platform, which is owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Still, Threads is making inroads as its monthly active user count grew from 320 million in 2024's fourth quarter to 350 million in Q1 of 2025. That's not at the level of X, which reportedly has more than 580 million monthly active users. Yet, perhaps AI feature integration can make Threads even more competitive with X in the coming quarters.\n\nThe company expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenue to range from $56 billion to $59 billion. That is expected to be driven primarily by ongoing strength in its advertising business, bolstered by the positive impact of AI-driven enhancements to ad targeting and user engagement across its family of apps.\nMeta Platforms as a Stock It is impossible to know how the economy will perform going forward. Similarly, it remains unclear whether Meta Platforms will achieve significant returns on its AI investments. These unknowns will not stop analysts from publishing their Meta stock price predictions, though.\nOppenheimer and Benchmark downgraded the stock following the third-quarter earnings release, citing increased capex concerns. However, BofA Securities has reiterated its Buy rating on the shares, keeping its price target at $900 and affirming long-term confidence in Meta, citing its user base and potential AI integration opportunities. Cantor Fitzgerald also reaffirmed its positive stance by reiterating an Overweight rating and $920 price target. It anticipates that improvements in AI execution will lead to a \"sentiment reversal\" for the company in 2026.\n\nThe aforementioned uncertainties are reflected in the wide range of Wall Street analysts' price targets for Meta Platforms. The Zuckerberg-led firm has a high price target of $1,117.00, a median price target of $837.92, and a low target price of $685.00. However, the consensus recommendation of 67 analysts covering the stock remains to buy shares.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$685.00\n5.5%\nMedian\n$837.92\n29.0%\nHigh\n$1,117.00\n72.0%\n\nMeta Platforms 2025 Outlook Meta Platforms raised its 2025 capex estimate from a range of $66 billion to $72 billion to a range of $70 billion to $72 billion. By now, you can probably guess what Meta Platforms is spending those extra billions on. If you guessed AI, you are correct. More specifically, Meta Platforms' management anticipates \"additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.\"\n\nHence, the multi-billion-dollar question is whether Meta Platforms can effectively leverage its costly AI enhancements. That's difficult to predict. The same goes for the state of the economy, which might not support an increase in ad spending if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate in the remainder of this year.\n24/7 Wall St.'s Meta forecast is a more bullish than the mean forecast, calling for the share price to rise to $935.29 by the end of next year. That implies a run of 44.0%. It is based on the company’s ability to sustain strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency. This should drive its bottom line despite higher capital expenditures for AI objectives.\nUltimately, your price target for Meta Platforms stock should depend on whether you expect the company to take full advantage of ramped-up AI features. If so, then get ready for Meta Platforms stock to eventually head for new all-time highs. However, it may be a bumpy ride along the way.\n\nMeta’s Heavy AI Spending Justified Says Pro. Is He Right?\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided.

What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(META) Boasts Significant Upside Potential Despite Morgan Stanley Price Target Cut\n\nNeha Gupta\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:15 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMS\n\nGOOG\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) is one of billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2026 . On December 11, Morgan Stanley cut its price target of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to $750 from $820 while reiterating an Overweight rating.\nMeta App 3D sign\nThe price cut comes amid concerns that sentiments around the social media networking stock have turned negative. That’s in part because of growing fears about revenue durability, operating expense uncertainty, and issues around the company’s Llama AI model. The shift in sentiment comes amid growing confidence in Alphabet’s prospects, buoyed by the tech giant’s AI initiatives.\n\nDespite the cut, the price target represents a significant upside potential. Additionally, Morgan Stanley insists Meta is one of the few companies that can leverage its data, distribution capabilities, and AI investments to generate long-term value.\nAdditionally, the stock came under pressure after the company detailed plans to develop a closed, monetizable AI model incorporating technology from Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba. Avocado is the proposed AI model slated for release next spring. Meta will reportedly retain control over the closed AI model, marking a significant departure from the open-source model it has championed over the years.\nThe Pivot towards a closed model is part of an effort to address the disappointments associated with Meta’s Llama 4 Open Source model.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a tech giant focused on connecting people through social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), advertising, and building the future of the internet with virtual and augmented reality (Metaverse, Quest headsets, AI), aiming to blend digital and physical worlds for work, play, and connection.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the Top AI and Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. On December 4, analyst John Blackledge of TD Cowen maintained a “Buy” rating on the company’s stock, retaining the price objective of $810.00. The analyst’s rating is backed by a combination of factors highlighting Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s strategic cost management and potential for earnings growth.\nOne of the main reasons is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s plan to significantly reduce its Metaverse-related expenses, which form part of the Reality Labs segment. As per the analyst, such cost reductions are anticipated to be ~30% by 2026, potentially leading to savings of $5 billion – $6 billion. Notably, this move can help partially mitigate the increased spending on AI infrastructure, which happens to be a key area of investment for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Stanley reduced its price objective on the company’s stock to $750.00 from $820.00, while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. While the firm reduced its price objective, it believes that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) happens to be one of the few selected companies that could leverage leading data, distribution capabilities, and AI investments to fuel earnings power and maintain technological leadership.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
