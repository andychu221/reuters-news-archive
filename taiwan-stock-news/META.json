      "Content": "Inside OpenAI's $1.5 million compensation packages\n\nCatherine Baab\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 5:48 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nOpenAI is paying its employees at levels that have little precedent in Silicon Valley history — $1.5 million in stock-based compensation per employee in 2025. That’s according to financial projections shared with investors and first reported by the Wall Street Journal .\nSuch compensation dwarfs what earlier generations of tech giants paid their workforces before going public. Adjusted for inflation, OpenAI's equity payouts are multiples above the norm for large tech firms over the past two decades, and even several times higher than what Alphabet or Meta disclosed ahead of their IPOs.\n\nFerocious competition for AI talent The $1.5 million figure makes clear just how fierce the competition is for top AI talent, with compensation for individual employees beginning to resemble packages that were once reserved for founders .\nAs generative AI models become central to corporate strategy, researchers and engineers with the most relevant expertise are becoming some of the most expensive employees anywhere in the world. To retain current employees and win sought-after job candidates, rival research labs and tech giants must make staggering offers .\n\nA classic example of \"prisoner's dilemma\" In game theory, such a dynamic is known as “ prisoner's dilemma ,” which describes situations in which competition effectively forces participants to escalate costs beyond what any individual would prefer.\nIn this case, if leading AI firms collectively capped compensation, they'd all benefit from lower costs and less-diluted equity. But no single company can afford restraint when competitors are bidding aggressively — not when falling behind in talent means falling behind in the technology itself. The result is a bidding war none of the participants can escape, even as it pushes the economics of AI development into increasingly unprecedented territory.\n\nAccordingly, OpenAI has had to loosen internal equity rules to stay competitive. One recent change removed a waiting period that required employees to stay six months before stock awards began vesting — a nod to a job market where researchers frequently move between companies and can command immediate payouts.\nCompensation now consumes 50% of OpenAI's revenue For OpenAI, this compensation strategy carries steep costs — in several senses. The company has about 4,000 employees at present, and stock compensation now consumes about half of the company’s annual revenue. That’s an unusually high share that likely contributes to operating losses and, at the same time, functions to dilute existing shareholders.\n\nStory Continues\nIn historical terms, the numbers are even more jarring. Among major tech companies that eventually went public, stock-based compensation typically accounted for a modest, single-digit percentage of revenue in pre-IPO years. But at OpenAI, it now approaches 50%.\nWhat’s more, per Wall Street Journal reporting , OpenAI’s investor materials suggest those costs will keep rising for years, even as the company continues to invest heavily in infrastructure and development.\nSo, can it last? Whether the strategy proves sustainable or not, it captures something essential about the contemporary tech economy. The overall pattern is familiar — a handful of firms create world-historical value while a tiny fraction of workers capture most of the gains — but the scale makes earlier booms look quaint. OpenAI is just making the math more explicit and more extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI Weekly: Meta wants Manus, AI investors want more in 2026\n\nReuters Videos\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:48 AM PST\n\nIn this video: META\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSTORY: From Meta's plans for Manus... to the AI outlook for investors in 2026. This is AI Weekly. :: AI Weekly Meta has said it will buy Chinese-founded startup Manus as the tech giant accelerates efforts to integrate advanced AI across its platforms. Financial terms were not released, but a source told Reuters the deal values Manus at between $2 billion and $3 billion. Manus went viral early this year on X after it released what it claimed was the world's first general AI agent, capable of making decisions and executing tasks autonomously with less prompting than ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The company was cheered by Chinese state television, with commentators calling it China's next DeepSeek. Nvidia is reportedly scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies. And according to sources, has approached contract manufacturer TSMC to ramp up production. They added that Chinese tech firms have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds just 700,000 units in stock. SoftBank Group said it completed a $41 billion investment in OpenAI. The move is one of the largest-ever private funding rounds that would give the Japanese firm a stake of about 11% in the ChatGPT maker. Artificial intelligence software developer Eliza Labs has ended its lawsuit accusing billionaire Elon Musk’s X Corp of extracting valuable information from the company before launching copycat AI products. A federal judge in Texas dismissed the case, after Eliza Labs and X said that they agreed to dismissal with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be refiled. X had denied wrongdoing. And as global markets closed out the year, they remained buoyed by strong fundamentals and rising capital flows into growth markets, amplified by an AI-driven investment boom. And that is expected to continue into 2026 as investors keep channelling capital into AI-linked infrastructure, foundries and supply chains. As well as betting on growth from data centers, advanced chip making, and next-generation computing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But I think the the the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So, you know, a lot of people should be actually reallocating now. Maybe not today, you know, on a few of the last trading days in the uh in the sessions here, but, you know, from a tax consequence standpoint. But I think, you know, you have an opportunity in the forward, you know, months coming forward here in 2024, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think I think the the point is is that you should. Don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n00:54 Speaker A\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n00:58 Speaker B\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, one out of every 10 years that you know, they've outperformed and we get seven out of 10 on the uh broader markets of out performance. So I like to stay US. So, you know, my thought is is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2024, but, you know, the dollar may, you know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cost average in, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just uh hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump 2.0, stocks soar again, gold hits records, AI boom rolls on — Yahoo Finance's 2025 year in review\n\nMyles Udland · Head of News\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 17 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGC=F\n\nBRK.A\n\nBTC-USD\n\nGOOG\n\nWhen the closing bell rings on Wall Street Wednesday afternoon, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) will clinch its third straight year of double-digit gains and end the year near a record high. Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on the year ahead too.\nPowered by the artificial intelligence trade once again, the 2025 financial markets story might seem, on the surface, to be a rerun of what investors lived through in 2023 and 2024.\n\nShine a bit of light on the subject, however, and we see the inner workings of the market's path in 2025 spun an eventful story that won't soon be forgotten.\nDonald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president.\nThe largest company in the world lost nearly 20% of its value in a single day.\nThe S&P 500 registered its worst week since the COVID crash of 2020, crashing 10% in just two days.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%.\nGold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year in two generations. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

      "Content": "These Stocks Are the Market’s Biggest Winners and Losers in 2025\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nUpdated Wed, December 31, 2025 at 3:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nLULU\n\nTSLA\n\nCOIN\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index is poised to end 2025 up more than 17% as the bull market continues for a third year driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.\nThe AI trade broadened out this year, as chip stocks again led the S&P 500 but were joined by the shares of companies tied to building the data centers that will power the technology. Three of the index’s top 10 performers in 2025 were data storage companies, which are among the main beneficiaries of the hundreds of billions of dollars in pledged spending by the giant AI cloud service providers known as hyperscalers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nOn the flip side, economic uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs weighed on the shares of consumer companies, while health-care stocks struggled with uncertainty surrounding the administration’s policies and pressure on drug prices.\nHere are some of the biggest winners and losers in the US stock market this year.\n\nWinner: New AI Leadership Technology stocks, especially those tied to AI, again dominated the market. But leadership shifted to the shares of companies associated with data — from storage to the building, heating and cooling of data centers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ) Corp., Amazon.com ( AMZN ) Inc., Alphabet ( GOOG ) Inc. and Meta Platforms ( META ) Inc. have pledged to spend more than $440 billion over the next 12 months to build out AI capabilities, benefiting firms such as Sandisk ( SNDK ) Corp., Western Digital ( WDC ) Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc ( STX ), which were three of the four best performing stocks in the S&P 500.\nWinner: New S&P 500 Additions A slew of companies were added to the S&P 500 in 2025, including Robinhood ( HOOD ) Markets Inc., Sandisk, AppLovin ( APP ) Corp. and Carvana ( CVNA ) Co., all of which posted triple-digit percentage gains and landed among the top 20 performers in the index.\nOf course, not every stock that joined the S&P 500 got a boost. Trade Desk ( TTD ) Inc. shares were the worst performers in the index with a nearly 70% loss, while Block ( XYZ ) Inc. tumbled more than 20% and Coinbase ( COIN ) Global Inc. sank more than 6%.\n\nWinner: Palantir Palantir ( PLTR ) Technologies Inc. shares are set to notch a triple-digit gain for the third year in a row. The software developer got a boost from AI enthusiasm and strong buy-in from retail traders who are drawn to the company’s outspoken Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp.\n\nBut the stock is now rather pricey. With a multiple of more than 180 times forward earnings, it’s the third most expensive member of the S&P 500 behind Tesla Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWinner: Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ) soared almost 175% in 2025 on the strength of takeover speculation. The company formally put itself up for sale in October, and there’s an ongoing battle between the top two bidders, Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) Corp. and Netflix ( NFLX ) Inc., with both suitors jockeying to strengthen financial backing for their offers.\nThe Warner Bros. board prefers the Netflix bid and is reportedly planning to reject Paramount’s offer, but Larry Ellison, the billionaire chairman of Oracle Corp. and father of Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison, is personally guaranteeing the Paramount proposal.\nLoser: Consumer Staples Economic uncertainty, tariffs and concerns about the health of the US consumer as inflation creeps higher weighed on consumer stocks, especially some major staples names. Clorox ( CLX ) Co., frozen french fries maker Lamb Weston ( LW ) Holdings Inc., Campbell’s ( CPB ) Co. and beverage giant Constellation Brands ( STZ ) Inc. were among the 20 worst-performers in the S&P 500. Shares of fast-casual dining brand Chipotle ( CMG ) Mexican Grill Inc. sank nearly 40% after two years of double-digit gains.\n\nLoser: Retail The same economic uncertainty also hit shares of some retail companies. Deckers ( DECK ) Outdoor Corp., which owns brands such as Hoka and Ugg, was down almost 50% in 2025, snapping a nine-year streak of gains. The stock was hit hard by a few weak earnings forecasts and analyst downgrades.\nLululemon ( LULU ) Athletica Inc. shares are set to fall nearly 45% this year, their second consecutive double-digit annual decline, as the athletic apparel retailer struggles through an overhaul after a period of slow growth and the recent exit of its chief executive officer. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in the company.\n\nLoser: Managed Care Health insurance stocks underperformed in 2025 despite hopes that the group would benefit from a shift in policy by the Trump administration. Molina ( MOH ) Healthcare Inc. shares were down more than 40%, their second straight year of double-digit declines. UnitedHealth ( UNH ) Group Inc. and Centene ( CNC ) Corp. have both shed more than 30%, putting them among the 25 worst performers in the S&P 500.\nStill, there are signs of hope for the group as some investors view the beaten-down valuations as attractive, making the stocks possibly due for a rebond. Money manager Michael Burry has said he’s long Molina shares and that he views the company as acquisition target in 2026 if it remains this cheap.\n\n—With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

For now, demand for data center hardware from the likes of Nvidia and Micron Technology remains high, and that will continue at least through the first half of 2026.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta Platforms (META) Increases Despite Market Slip: Here's What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nMeta Platforms (META) closed at $666.01 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.11% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.14% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.24%.\nThe social media company's shares have seen an increase of 2.78% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.94%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $8.16, indicating a 1.75% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $58.4 billion, showing a 20.69% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $23.04 per share and revenue of $199.46 billion. These totals would mark changes of -3.44% and +21.25%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 1.71% upward. Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note Meta Platforms's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 28.59. This denotes a discount relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 28.78.\n\nIt's also important to note that META currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.73. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.85 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 62, finds itself in the top 26% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "An AI super-bull who just backed the Nvidia-Groq deal warns of a data center bust: ‘We foresee a significant financial crisis’\n\nEva Roytburg\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 11:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nEQIX\n\nMSFT\n\nCIFR\n\nOne of the most aggressive backers of the AI boom—whose firm most recently facilitated Nvidia’s largest deal ever —has issued a warning to the rest of the market: The “build it and they will come” approach to data centers is a dangerous gamble.\nAlex Davis, chief executive of Austin-based investment firm Disruptive, wrote in a letter to investors he expects a “significant financing crisis” to hit the speculative data-center market as soon as 2027 or 2028, driven by extreme capital expenditure and a growing mismatch between who is constructing AI infrastructure and who will ultimately use it.\n\n“We are seeing way too many business models (and valuation levels) with no realistic margin expansion story, extreme capex spend, lack of enterprise customer traction, or overdependence on “roundtrip” investments – in some cases all with the same company,” Davis wrote.\nDavis’ warning was first reported by Axios .\nThe warning comes just days after Nvidia agreed to license assets from Groq, a high-performance AI chipmaking startup Disruptive has backed since its founding (not to be confused with Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot). The transaction, which Davis has said is valued at roughly $20 billion in cash, represents the largest deal Nvidia has ever completed and underscores how aggressively the company is moving to lock up all the verticals in AI talent and intellectual property.\n\nYet, Davis argues the same exuberance driving landmark transactions at the chip level is also fueling excess elsewhere in the AI stack, particularly among third-party data-center developers betting on what he called the “build it and they will come” model.\n“If you’re a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers,” Davis wrote in the letter. “We want to back the owner-users, not the speculative landlords.”\nThe risk, as the venture capitalist sees it, is not that demand for AI compute disappears, but rather that capital has rushed into the wrong hands. While hyperscalers and well-capitalized tech companies can absorb massive upfront costs, speculative landlords rely on short-term financing and customers that may never materialize at scale.\nDavis didn’t name names in his letter, but if you follow his distinction about “speculative landlords” versus “owner/users” like Microsoft and Meta that will eventually build their own facilities, the most obvious targets could be the legacy wholesale giants like Digital Realty and Equinix .\n\nStructured as something called “real estate investment trusts,” these companies generate returns by developing and leasing capacity to the same tech giants Davis predicts will soon cut out to capture margins themselves. If that shift accelerates, it could leave landlords facing refinancing pressure just as a wave of debt comes due, even if overall demand for AI compute continues to rise. That imbalance, he warned, could place significant stress on private credit markets and ripple outward if financing conditions tighten.\n\nStory Continues\nDigital Realty and Equinix did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nDavis’ argument echoes warnings made on the other side of the aisle, including the thesis of famed short-seller Jim Chanos , who explicitly bets against “neoclouds” and converted crypto-miners like Cipher Mining. Chanos has argued that data center hosting is becoming a “commodity business,” warning clients that “the magic and the money is going to come from what the chips produce ultimately, not where they reside.” Both investors seem to agree that while the AI technology itself is valuable, the third-party landlords rushing to house it are walking into a trap.\n\nYet the caution is startling coming from Davis, who said in the letter that he remains deeply bullish on AI itself. Disruptive has deployed billions of dollars across private technology companies it views as core to the AI economy, including Groq, open-source model developers, and defense-oriented software firms. Davis describes the current wave of AI innovation as a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.\n“While I continue to believe the ongoing advancements in AI technology present ‘once in a lifetime’ investment opportunities, I also continue to see risks and reason for caution and investment discipline,” he wrote.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta closed the deal at more than $2 billion.\n\nManus, a Singapore-based platform with some Chinese roots, launched its first “general-purpose” AI agent earlier this year. The platform offers paid subscriptions for customers to use this technology for research, coding and other tasks.\n“Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide,” Meta said in a Monday announcement, adding that it plans to scale this service — as Manus will “deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including in Meta AI.”\nXiao Hong, CEO of Manus, added that joining Meta will allow the platform to “build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made.” Manus confirmed that it would continue to sell and operate subscriptions through its own app and website.\n\nThe platform has grown rapidly over the past year. Earlier this month, Manus announced that it had crossed the $100 million mark in annual recurring revenue, just eight months after launching.\nSome of Manus' initial financial backers reportedly included China's Tencent Holdings, ZhenFund and HSG. And the company that first launched the platform — Butterfly Effect, which also operates under the name monica.im, which was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that there would be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” following its transaction, and that the platform would also discontinue its services and operations in China. Manus reiterated that it would continue to operate in Singapore, where most of its employees are based.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been pushing to revive its commercial AI efforts as the company faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI , maker of ChatGPT. In June, the company made a $14.3 billion investment in AI data company Scale and recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang to help lead a team developing “superintelligence” at the tech giant.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

According to Bloomberg , the deal values Manus at more than $2 billion. Hennessy Funds portfolio manager Josh Wein, along with Yahoo Finance Senior Reporters Brooke DiPalma and Ines Ferré , discuss the deal and what it reveals about the state of AI.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian\nJosh, good to see you here. Uh, I talked a little bit about it yesterday, kind of continuing the theme of uh what Nvidia did with Groq that that big $20 billion deal. Today, we have this deal, Manus spending two, uh I should say Meta spending $2 billion to buy Manus. What does that signal to you about the AI trade?\n00:18 Josh\nYeah, I I it's good to be with you, Brian. Yeah, it seems like, you know, there's certainly a an overall theme in the market of a lot of cash on balance sheets. You know, the S&P has about, the S&P companies about $7 trillion in cash. I think with AI, it's like an arms race.\n00:32 Josh\nyou know, these small companies are obviously being bought up and they don't mean anything to the average investor, but, you know, it's kind of, I think time is of the essence and instead of developing these technologies on their own, a lot of companies, you know, are just going to the M&A market and it it signals an urgency that uh, you know, we haven't seen in a while on the part of a of a sector of the economy.\n00:52 Brian\nBrooke, poll 5,000 people yesterday and I would argue they never even heard of Manus before.\n00:57 Josh\nNo.\n00:59 Brian\nGo ahead, Brooke.\n01:00 Brooke\nDefinitely have not heard of Manuse. I I mean or Manis or rather. But basically what we're hearing from Wall Street this morning is that this is really Meta's way of getting in on the action as Josh alluded to. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts saying largely that this purchase expands Meta's former AI agent test capabilities as it currently lacks applications built on foundations. Think about it, you have chat GBT, you have Google Gemini, you have Anthropic, Claude and so really what was needed here was something like this for Meta to really get in the game.\n01:29 Brooke\nThey said they're going to spend billions of dollars on data projects in the coming years. And so really investors are waiting on that key return of this investment and how this plays out and that certainly gives Meta the reality of this. Also, this company really kind of getting in on the action here, this startup, really getting in uh on Meta's uh on a good note, getting in where it's early on. Meta can really mold this over the next couple of years to make it what it is.\n01:49 Brian\nAnd Ines, I love seeing these deals. Nvidia for Groq, $20 billion, Meta dropping $2 billion on this company I I would argue not a lot of folks that even heard of. It really pushes back on that AI bubble thesis.\n01:58 Ines\n100%. And if you take a look at what this company is, I mean, they have, they launched in March of 2024. So it really speaks to the speed of where AI is going. This is not just a chatbot. It is much more sophisticated from what I've seen compared to Google Gemini, compared to Chat GBT because it actually can do things for you.\n02:18 Ines\nI mean if you look at their, one of their videos online about what this can do for recruiters, it can look through resumes, it'll give you a synopsis and get recommendations. When your laptop is even off, you can it's still running for you, the program's still running. It can do property research, it can build websites, it can make videos. It does so much more. So the fact that Meta has acquired this company at such an early stage, really signals where this agent AI uh is going and the the big, big capabilities that you're seeing within AI.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nTuttle Capital Management Launches the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\n\nNewsfile\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:02 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CBOE\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGreenwich, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - December 30, 2025) - Tuttle Capital Management, a leading provider of thematic and alternatives ETFs, today announced the launch of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (CBOE: MAGO) , now trading on the CBOE.\nMAGO is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the equity performance of the \"Magnificent 7\" - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - using an options 1 -based strategy designed to harvest option premium while maintaining equity-like exposure to these market-defining companies.\n\nThe fund combines direct exposure to the Magnificent 7 with a systematic put-spread 2 program implemented with listed options and FLEX Options® 3 to potentially generate income. The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the fund, please call (833) 759-6110 or visit the Fund's website.\n\nDistributor: Foreside Fund Services, LLC\nMedia Contact:\nMatthew Tuttle\nTuttle Capital Management\nmtuttle@tuttlecap.com\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/279159\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta to Buy Manus, an AI Startup With Chinese Roots\n\nKurt Wagner, Luz Ding and Lulu Yilun Chen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:44 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTCEHY\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to buy Manus, a popular Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, in its effort to build a business around its massive AI investment.\nThe deal values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a rare US acquisition of an Asian tech company and the latest multibillion-dollar AI bet from Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The agreement was struck in about 10 days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are not public.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nMeta intends to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating the technology into its products, it said in a statement. Backed by some of China’s biggest names including Tencent Holdings Ltd., ZhenFund and HSG, Manus shot to prominence early this year not long after DeepSeek’s debut. All of its existing investors have been bought out in Meta’s takeover, one of the people said. It's unclear whether severing Chinese ties will ease government concerns at a time when the Asian nation and the US are vying for AI dominance.\n“There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson said. Manus' parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\n\nZuckerberg has made AI his company’s top priority, and is spending billions to hire researchers, build data centers and develop new models. Manus had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year from selling its AI agent to businesses via subscriptions, which could give Meta a more immediate return on some of its AI spending.\nThe Manus AI agent can complete a handful of general tasks, such as screening resumes, creating trip itineraries and analyzing stocks in response to basic instructions. Butterfly Effect raised money earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in an investment round led by US venture capital firm Benchmark.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nMeta's purchase of Manus is likely aimed at expanding the former's AI agent task capabilities, as it currently lacks applications built on its own foundation model compared to a broader application ecosystem for ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. While the deal marks an early step for Meta to build a subscription and API business around its AI investment, it could draw regulatory scrutiny given that Singapore-based Manus was founded in China.\n\nStory Continues\n— Mandeep Singh and Robert Biggar, BI analysts\nAI agents are tools that don’t need human supervision to perform specific digital tasks. Enterprise software companies such as Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. have heavily promoted their versions of agents as the most effective way for businesses to use the emerging technology, rather than generative AI features such as chatbots, which require user prompts and interaction.\n\nMeta already has an AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available through the company’s social media and messaging platforms — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — in addition to its AI glasses. The US company is acquiring the technology and leadership group from Manus, though its statement didn’t detail where the new team will sit within the organization. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the deal’s value, said Manus co-founder and CEO Xiao Hong will report to Javier Olivan, chief operating officer of Meta, citing people familiar with the acquisition.\nAlexandr Wang, Meta’s Chief AI Officer who joined this summer as part of a high-profile investment into his startup, welcomed the Manus team of about 100 staff with a post on X. In his own message on the platform, Manus’ Xiao said that the deal would help his company expand the reach of its agents. “The era of AI that doesn’t just talk, but acts, creates, and delivers, is only beginning,” he wrote. “And now, we get to build it at a scale we never could have imagined.”\n\nMeta’s aggressive spending to compete in the AI race is matched by rivals like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. Zuckerberg has pledged to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure projects over the next three years, many of them expected to be AI-related. The company has hired an expensive team of researchers to develop a new state-of-the-art AI model it plans to debut next spring, and has faced some skepticism from investors who worry that the heavy spending won’t result in meaningful revenue anytime soon.\nVC firm Benchmark was criticized earlier this year by lawmakers and other venture investors for backing an AI company with ties to China. “Who thinks it is a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me,” US Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, wrote in a post on X in May. Benchmark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Meta deal Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the deal during a regular press briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday referred reporters to relevant regulatory agencies without elaborating.\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Philip Glamann.\n(Updates with US-China context in third paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens News of the day for Dec. 30, 2025\n\nTerry Lane\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:22 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGC=F\n\nSI=F\n\n^DJI\n\nBTC-USD\n\nStock futures are little changed this morning after two consecutive sessions of losses for major indexes; tech stocks have stabilized after slumping on Monday; gold and silver prices are surging after the precious metals posted steep declines to start the week; Facebook-parent Meta announced it acquired AI agent firm Manus. Here's what investors need to know today.\n\nStock Futures Steady After Two Days of Losses Stock futures are holding steady this morning after major indexes lost ground on Monday for the second straight session. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were hovering near unchanged in recent trading. Bitcoin was at $87,900, up from an overnight low of around $87,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences mortgage rates and costs on other consumer loans, was at 4.14%, up from 4.12% at yesterday's close. Oil prices continued to climb amid tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up 0.3% at $58.30 per barrel, trading near their highest levels of the month.\n\nMajor Tech Stocks Stabilize After Rocky Start to Week Shares of some of the world's biggest technology companies are back on firmer footing Tuesday after leading the market's downturn yesterday.Concerns about whether major tech companies will profit from massive investments in artificial intelligence have weighed on investor sentiment in recent months. In premarket trading Tuesday, Tesla ( TSLA ) shares were up 0.5%, after the stock fell 3.3% on Monday to lead Nasdaq decliners. Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia ( NVDA ) inched higher after shedding more than 1% yesterday, while Palantir ( PLTR ) ticked higher after dropping more than 2% Monday and Oracle ( ORCL ) was little changed after sliding 1%.\n\nGold and Silver Prices Surge After Monday Sell-Off Gold and silver prices are bouncing back from the big declines posted yesterday after exchange operator CME Group made a key change to its metals contracts. Gold futures were recently up 1.7% at $4,415 an ounce, after sliding as low as $4,330 yesterday. Silver futures were up more than 7% this morning, at around $75.55 an ounce. After a weeks-long rally that had lifted the precious metals to a series of record highs, gold and silver plunged on Monday after CME raised its margin requirements for precious metals contracts.

( NASDAQ:META ) has agreed to acquire Manus, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, as it looks to build more immediate commercial returns from its expanding AI investments. The transaction values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, and was finalized in roughly 10 days. Meta said it plans to continue operating and selling the Manus service while integrating it into its own products, marking a rare US acquisition of an Asian technology company and another major AI commitment under Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nIs META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nManus has been backed by investors including Tencent Holdings, ZhenFund and HSG, and gained attention earlier this year after the debut of DeepSeek. The AI agent had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year, generated through subscription sales to businesses, which could provide Meta with a faster path to monetization than longer-dated AI research efforts. The agent can perform general tasks such as screening resumes, creating travel itineraries and analyzing stocks based on simple instructions. Its parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before relocating to Singapore and raised funding earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in a round led by Benchmark.\n\nThe acquisition comes as AI agents are increasingly promoted by enterprise software companies as tools that operate without constant human supervision, an approach that differs from traditional chatbots. Meta already offers Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and its AI glasses, and is acquiring both the technology and leadership team from Manus, though it has not disclosed where the group will sit internally. The deal lands amid heightened investor debate over Meta's aggressive AI spending, political scrutiny in the US over investment in China-linked AI firms, and limited public comment from Chinese officials, who referred questions to regulatory agencies without further detail.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta's 2025 Reality Check: Three Moves That Redefined Its AI Trajectory\n\nLawrence Nga, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms has traded near-term margins for long-term control of AI.\nIts open-source software could be the answer to building an AI ecosystem.\nMeta rebuilt its AI organization to prioritize execution over experimentation.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n2025 wasn't a year of incremental progress for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . It was a year of commitment. While much of the tech industry debated how quickly to move forward with artificial intelligence, Meta chose a clear path: spend heavily now, accept near-term pressure, and build long-term control.\n\nMeta didn't try to win headlines with a single breakthrough product. Instead, it laid foundations across infrastructure, software, and organization. If AI truly becomes the next computing platform, 2025 may be the year Meta positions itself as an infrastructure business, not just an app company riding the wave.\nHere are the three moves that mattered most this past year.\nMeta prioritized long-term AI control over short-term margin Meta's most controversial decision in 2025 was also its most revealing: committing roughly $60–65 billion in capital , primarily toward AI compute and data centers. That level of spending unsettled some investors, especially those who had grown accustomed to Meta's post-2022 cost discipline.\nBut this wasn't reckless expansion. It was a calculated bet to gain long-term competitive advantage in this area. The bottlenecks in AI development increasingly center around compute -- specifically, who has access to it, who can afford it, and who can iterate the fastest. By scaling one of the world's largest GPU fleets and investing in AI-optimized data centers, Meta aims to remove that bottleneck internally.\n\nFor investors, the key insight is this: Meta stopped optimizing for quarterly optics and started optimizing for strategic independence. As Amazon did with AWS in the early 2010s, Meta chose to absorb upfront costs to secure a durable advantage. If AI economics increasingly favor scale, Meta wants to sit on the right side of that curve.\nLLaMA turned Meta into a player in the AI ecosystem If infrastructure was Meta's physical foundation in 2025, LLaMA was its software wedge. While competitors like OpenAI continued to push closed, API-driven models, Meta has doubled down on open source. With the rolloutof LLaMA 4, the company showed that open-source models can compete near the frontier, while remaining more efficient to deploy and customize.\n\nThe real significance wasn't raw benchmark performance. It was adoption. By making LLaMA freely available, Meta encouraged start-ups, researchers, and enterprises to build on its models. That shifted much of the deployment cost outward, while pulling developers into Meta's orbit. Over time, that creates a powerful network effect: frameworks, tools, and optimizations increasingly standardize around Meta's models.\n\nStory Continues\nThis approach echoes Android's rise in the mobile market. Android didn't need to out-monetize iOS directly. It won by becoming the default layer on which others built. Meta is attempting a similar play in AI by positioning LLaMA not as a consumer product competing with ChatGPT but as AI infrastructure for everyone else.\n\nMeta rebuilt its AI organization around speed and execution The third defining shift of 2025 was internal. Meta reorganized its AI efforts under a new structure, forming Superintelligence Labs and bringing in Alexandr Wang to lead the push toward more capable reasoning systems. At the same time, the company trimmed and reshuffled parts of its AI organization, signaling a move away from sprawl and toward execution.\n\nThis mattered because Meta's challenge was never a lack of research talent. It was translating research into products quickly and consistently. In 2025, management made it clear that success would be measured not by papers or demos, but by how quickly intelligence is reflected in real user experiences.\nThat focus aligns with Meta's most significant advantage: scale. With billions of users across its apps, Meta can deploy AI features, gather feedback, and iterate faster than almost any competitor. Rebuilding the organization around that loop -- build, ship, learn -- was a necessary step.\nFor investors, this shift suggests a disciplined approach. Meta isn't trying to win the AI race by hiring endlessly or chasing abstract goals. It's trying to win by shipping faster than peers at a massive scale.\n\nFor Meta, the payoff doesn't need to show up as LLaMA revenue. It appears when better models enhance ad targeting, content ranking, creator tools, and messaging experiences across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Open source, in this context, isn't altruism--it's leverage.\nWhat does it mean for investors? Taken together, Meta's 2025 decisions tell a coherent story. The company chose to spend heavily on compute, open its models to the world, and restructure its AI organization around speed. None of these moves guarantees success on its own. But together, they significantly raise Meta's odds.\nIf AI becomes the backbone of future digital experiences, Meta has positioned itself not only as a participant but also as an infrastructure provider. For long-term investors, that shift matters far more than any single quarter's margin.\n\nThe real question now isn't what Meta built in 2025 -- it's how effectively it converts that foundation into durable results in the years ahead. All eyes are on the company's execution in the coming quarters.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "AI Trade’s Next Leg Is All About Tech’s ‘Pick-and-Shovel’ Stocks\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBTC-USD\n\nVRT\n\nSNDK\n\nAPH\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The artificial intelligence trade is moving, and investors seeking cutting-edge ways to play it are snapping up technology “pick-and-shovel” stocks as massive cloud service providers pour billions into new data centers.\nData storage companies dominated the S&P 500 Index in 2025, with Sandisk Corp. shares soaring almost 580% to make them the benchmark’s best performer, with Western Digital Corp. in second and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc in fourth. Meanwhile, AI-linked power providers and cable and fiber producers such as Amphenol Corp., Corning Inc., NRG Energy Inc. and GE Vernova Inc. were among the Top 25.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nThat’s a shift from the last few years, when Nvidia Corp. — the original AI pick-and-shovel company — was entrenched among the top stocks in the S&P 500. The chip giant gained 40% in 2025, making it the 71st best performer in the index this year. While Nvidia and cloud hyperscalers Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are still powering the market due to their sheer size, their percentage gains have started to wane.\n“When the benchmarks are fairly concentrated, it’s important to look for themes that are gonna drive sales and earnings growth,” said Jake Seltz, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “AI is kind of one of those dominant themes right now, that’s nothing new. So we’re just looking, broadening our horizons beyond tech.”\n\nInvestors can find room to grow and better valuations by buying into the next wave of companies that are set to benefit from the billions of dollars hyperscalers are spending to build data centers.\n“What we are focused on are the picks and shovels of where that money is being spent,” said Matt Sallee, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which doesn’t own shares of any hyperscalers. “The chips to a degree, but more so some of the names that you haven’t really heard of.”\nOf course, there are some fears on Wall Street that the spending could slow, reversing gains in stocks tied to AI. It’s similar to what happened during the pandemic, when demand for basic home health products took off.\n“Covid hit and this world needed way more face masks, hand sanitizer, all those things,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management. But within six to 12 months there was a glut, and “those businesses that supplied those things went from the best times ever to the absolute worst times ever.”\nStill, investors remain bullish on the AI trade as the hyperscalers keep pledging to spend. Here’s what investors are buying now to play the tech infrastructure buildout.\n\nStory continues\nData Storage\nWall Street expects data storage to remain hot in 2026 after Sandisk, Western Digital and Seagate surged in 2025. However, the boom times for this year’s winners may be coming to an end. For example, the average analyst price target for Sandisk in 2026 is $264, which would be a roughly 8% gain from where it currently sits at around $244.\n\nAnalysts see much bigger upside in a company like Pure Storage Inc., which is trading for $68 but is projected to reach $94 in 2026, a 38% leap. Other digital storage shares tied to AI include NetApp Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc.\nConstruction and Power\nA range of stocks associated with building and powering data centers are expected to keep running. Quanta Services Inc., which provides specialized contracting for utilities and telecommunications companies, is a top pick for Tortoise Capital’s Sallee. Other contractors include MYR Group Inc., Primoris Services Corp. and MasTec Inc.\nCompanies involved in wiring are also popular. They include Amphenol, which designs and manufactures high-speed fiber and copper interconnect solutions used in data centers, and Emcor Group Inc., which does mechanical and electrical construction. Other power infrastructure names include Vistra Corp., Constellation Energy Corp., GE Vernova and Generac Holdings Inc., which makes backup generators.\n\nBitcoin Miners\nBitcoin miners represent a potential “total revaluation story” as they pivot toward powering data centers and away from mining the cryptocurrency, according to Sallee.\n“They have the electricity already, they’ve had it for five-plus years to produce Bitcoin,” he said. “They’re going to redirect that electricity to higher-value, long-term contracts for high performance computing hosting.”\nNames in this area include Bitdeer Technologies Group, whose shares jumped in October after the company announced plans to move further into AI. Shares of IREN Ltd., Cipher Mining Inc., Riot Platforms Inc. and WhiteFiber Inc. have also received a boost from the companies’ intentions to convert to high-performance computing data centers.\nHeating and Cooling\n\nData centers require specialized precision controlled heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, creating demand for the companies that make them. Vertiv Holdings Co., which provides power systems and cooling solutions for data centers, is up 46% in 2025 and remains a stock to watch. Eaton Corp., another power management firm, overlaps with Vertiv but is less of a pure play, according to Seltz.\nOther names in the space include Comfort Systems USA Inc., which provides heating ventilation and air conditioning system installation and maintenance, as well as water providers Xylem Inc., Ecolab Inc. and American Water Works Co.\nSoftware\nSome investors with longer time horizons are looking to software as future beneficiaries of AI as large language models improve and more applications are built.\n\n“Investors are, I think, naturally inclined to look for companies that have cheaper valuations with terrific magnitude of growth that are potentially gonna really benefit from the application of AI,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha.\nSoftware stocks have generally underperformed this year, with the S&P 500 Software Industry Index rising 12% in 2025 compared with a 17% gain in the overall benchmark. But that has made the stocks’ valuations more appealing.\n“I don’t think those stories are dead,” said Allspring’s Seltz, who is watching names such as Snowflake Inc., Datadog Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. “It feels like it might be a little early, but the stocks do look attractive.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta to Acquire Manus in $2 Billion Bet on AI Agents\n\nKurt Wagner, Luz Ding and Lulu Yilun Chen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:18 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTCEHY\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to buy Manus, a popular Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, in its effort to build a business around its massive AI investment.\nThe deal values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a rare US acquisition of an Asian tech company and the latest multibillion-dollar AI bet from Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The agreement was struck in about 10 days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are not public.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nMeta intends to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating it into its products, it said in a statement. Backed by some of China’s biggest names like Tencent Holdings Ltd., ZhenFund and HSG, Manus shot to prominence early this year not long after DeepSeek’s debut. All of its existing investors have been bought out in Meta’s takeover, one of the people said.\n“There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson said. Manus' parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\n\nZuckerberg has made AI his company’s top priority, and is spending billions to hire researchers, build data centers and develop new models. Manus had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year from selling its AI agent to businesses via subscriptions, which could give Meta a more immediate return on some of its AI spending\nThe Manus AI agent can complete a handful of general tasks, such as screening resumes, creating trip itineraries and analyzing stocks in response to basic instructions. Butterfly Effect raised money earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in an investment round led by US venture capital firm Benchmark.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nMeta's purchase of Manus is likely aimed at expanding the former's AI agent task capabilities, as it currently lacks applications built on its own foundation model compared to a broader application ecosystem for ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. While the deal marks an early step for Meta to build a subscription and API business around its AI investment, it could draw regulatory scrutiny given that Singapore-based Manus was founded in China.\n\nStory Continues\n— Mandeep Singh and Robert Biggar, BI analysts\nAI agents are tools that don’t need human supervision to perform specific digital tasks. Enterprise software companies such as Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. have heavily promoted their versions of agents as the most effective way for businesses to use the emerging technology, rather than generative AI features such as chatbots, which require user prompts and interaction.\n\nMeta already has an AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available through the company’s social media and messaging platforms — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — in addition to its AI glasses. The US company is acquiring the technology and leadership group from Manus, though its statement didn’t detail where the new team will sit within the organization. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the deal’s value, said Manus co-founder and CEO Xiao Hong will report to Javier Olivan, chief operating officer of Meta, citing people familiar with the acquisition.\nAlexandr Wang, Meta’s Chief AI Officer who joined this summer as part of a high-profile investment into his startup, welcomed the Manus team of about 100 staff with a post on X. In his own message on the platform, Manus’ Xiao said that the deal would help his company expand the reach of its agents. “The era of AI that doesn’t just talk, but acts, creates, and delivers, is only beginning,” he wrote. “And now, we get to build it at a scale we never could have imagined.”\n\nMeta’s aggressive spending to compete in the AI race is matched by rivals like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. Zuckerberg has pledged to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure projects over the next three years, many of them expected to be AI-related. The company has hired an expensive team of researchers to develop a new state-of-the-art AI model it plans to debut next spring, and has faced some skepticism from investors who worry that the heavy spending won’t result in meaningful revenue anytime soon.\nVC firm Benchmark was criticized earlier this year by lawmakers and other venture investors for backing an AI company with ties to China. “Who thinks it is a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me,” US Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, wrote in a post on X in May. Benchmark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Meta deal Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the deal during a regular press briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday referred reporters to relevant regulatory agencies without elaborating.\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Philip Glamann.\n(Updates with Meta comment in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.\nBuy the \"Mag 7\" Hyperscalers Or Are They Spending Too Much?\nAlthough they are among the world&rsquo;s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\n\nThis includes Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\nThere is no doubt that &ldquo;hyperscaling&rdquo; is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns\nNotably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billio\nROIC Comparison\nWith Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market&rsquo;s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\n\nAmazon&rsquo;s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance\nMagnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon&rsquo;s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon&rsquo;s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts\nAmazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500&rsquo;s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Meta just bought Manus, an AI startup everyone has been talking about\n\nConnie Loizos\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:39 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nTCEHY\n\nMark Zuckerberg has struck again.\nMeta Platforms is acquiring Manus, a Singapore-based AI startup that’s become the talk of Silicon Valley since it materialized this spring with a demo video so slick it went instantly viral. The clip showed an AI agent that could do things like screen job candidates, plan vacations, and analyze stock portfolios. Manus claimed at the time that it outperformed OpenAI’s Deep Research.\n\nBy April, just weeks after launch, the early-stage firm Benchmark led a $75 million funding round that assigned Manus a post-money valuation of $500 million. General partner Chetan Puttagunta joined the board. Per Chinese media outlets , some other big-name backers had already invested in Manus at that point, including Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly known as Sequoia China) via an earlier $10 million round.\nThough Bloomberg raised questions when Manus started charging $39 or $199 a month for access to its AI models (the outlet noted the pricing seemed “ somewhat aggressive . . . for a membership service still in a testing phase,”) the company recently announced it had since signed up millions of users and crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nThat’s when Meta started negotiating with Manus, according to the WSJ , which says Meta is paying $2 billion — the same valuation Manus was seeking for its next funding round.\nFor Zuckerberg, who has staked Meta’s future on AI, Manus represents something new: an AI product that’s actually making money (investors have grown increasingly twitchy about Meta’s $60 billion infrastructure spending spree).\nMeta says it’ll keep Manus running independently while weaving its agents into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, where Meta’s own chatbot, Meta AI, is already available to users.\nThere is one wrinkle, however, which is that Manus, which launched eight months ago, has Chinese founders who founded parent company Butterfly Effect in Beijing in 2022 before decamping to Singapore in the middle of this year. Whether that raises flags in Washington remains to be seen, but Senator John Cornyn already dragged Benchmark for its investment in the company, asking back in May on X who thought it was “a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me.”\n\nCornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has long been one of Congress’s most vocal hawks on China and technology competition, but he’s hardly alone. Being tough on China has become one of the genuinely bipartisan issues in Congress.\nUnsurprisingly, Meta has already told Nikkei Asia that after the acquisition, Manus won’t have any ties to Chinese investors and will no longer operate in China. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson told the outlet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: META ) is among the Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 2026 . On December 23, Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) but slightly lowered the price target from $820 to $815. A day later Sebastian appeared on a CNBC Television interview to discuss his outlook on the stock.\n\nThe rating comes at a time when Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has decreased more than 10.13% over the past 6 months. Sebastian noted that the firm acknowledges the concerns regarding the company’s margins and investments are legitimate. However, he highlighted that the firm is advising investors to look ahead, given the importance of the AI theme and the critical position the company holds in the industry.\nHe added that the company is expected to launch AI products by leveraging all the investment and hiring it has done in the past 2 years. Sebastian highlighted the launch of the next Llama model, updates to Meta AI, and monetization of WhatsApp and Threads as key catalysts for the company’s upcoming growth. He notes that these steps would enable the company to sustain a healthy growth rate.\n\nSebastian also believes that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a fantastic advertising model. He added that Google and Meta have accounted for around 80% of the industry growth in 2025, suggesting the efficiency of their model. The analyst highlighted the huge gap between the monetization at Meta and Google, suggesting a huge upside potential and room for growth for Meta.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is focused on developing AI-powered social platforms and immersive technologies, including Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Why This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is 1 of My Top Dividend Stock Ideas for 2026 and Beyond\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:51 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Meta's dividend is minuscule relative to the company's profits, leaving significant room for growth over time.\nThe social media specialist also returns capital to shareholders through significant share repurchases.\nThe business is growing rapidly, providing another layer of support for dividend growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nWhen most investors think about the \"Magnificent Seven,\" they're typically thinking about growth -- not income. But the truth is that a few of these companies now generate so much cash that they can invest aggressively and still send capital back to shareholders.\nCase in point: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . Though the company's dividend is still young, with the first payments to shareholders starting last year, it's one of my favorite dividend ideas for 2026 and beyond. Not only can the social media company easily afford its dividend, but it also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases . Best of all, the underlying business has seen explosive growth recently.\nSure, the stock may not be a good fit for someone who needs significant income from their investments. At Meta's current quarterly dividend of $0.525 per share, the annualized payout is $2.10, which works out to a dividend yield of just 0.3%. But what makes Meta interesting is the runway for dividend growth, not just the current yield.\nA payout ratio that leaves wiggle room A good dividend is only as strong as the company's ability to keep paying it. One way to gauge that is the payout ratio, or the percent of earnings the company is paying out in dividends.\nMeta's payout ratio is extremely low, at just 9%.\nThis means there's significant room in the coming years for dividend increases. Of course, shareholders likely don't want to see Meta's payout ratio rise meaningfully anytime soon, as the company has a lot of growth opportunities to invest in -- namely AI (artificial intelligence) data centers. In fact, the company expects to spend $70 to $72 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 alone, largely driven by investments in AI computing infrastructure.\n\nBig share repurchases While Meta's dividend yield is low, the company's total shareholder yield has been meaningful when including share repurchases (an indirect way to return capital to shareholders by reducing a company's total share count).\nIn Q3, Meta returned about $1.3 billion in dividends, and it spent almost $3.2 billion repurchasing its shares. In Q2, Meta spent nearly $10 billion repurchasing its shares.\n\nStory Continues\nRapid business growth Of course, the best part of Meta's dividend growth story is the company's strong underlying business growth.\nIts third-quarter revenue rose 26% year over year to about $51.2 billion -- an acceleration from the 22% year-over-year revenue growth Meta posted in Q2. Fueling its third-quarter growth was a 14% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and 10% growth in average price per ad.\n\nFree cash flow is also worth watching for dividend investors because it reflects how much cash is left after capital spending but before dividend payments and share repurchases. Meta reported about $10.6 billion of free cash flow in Q3.\nAn important caveat With all of this said, it's possible that Meta will put dividend growth on hold temporarily, or at least turn to only modest dividend hikes.\nThis is because Meta is investing heavily in AI.\n\"I think that it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load building capacity so that way we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the company's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nIn addition to guiding for $70 billion to $72 billion in 2025 capital expenditures, management said capital expenditures dollar growth is expected to be notably larger in 2026 than in 2025.\nThat spending could cap how fast the dividend can grow in the near term.\nFinally, it's worth noting that while Meta stock isn't necessarily expensive, it's not cheap either. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29 as of this writing. This makes it important that Meta continues growing rapidly -- and that its aggressive investments in AI pay off handsomely.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

Silver and gold swung after a sharp pullback from fresh all-time highs, as traders booked profits and liquidity thinned after the holidays.\nCrypto traders kept describing the same theme, a market that keeps moving, then does it with less depth.\nMarket snapshot Bitcoin : $87,164, down 1.9%\nEther : $2,929, down 2.3%\nXRP: $1.85, down 2.2%\nTotal crypto market cap: $3.03 trillion, down 2.1%\nBitcoin And Ether Drift Sideways As Year-End Volumes Fade Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, said year-end trading has slowed and volumes have faded across major assets. “Bitcoin and Ethereum have both traded largely sideways over the past week, reflecting seasonal inactivity rather than a meaningful shift in market structure,” he said.\n“Activity has cooled across most chains, with a broad consolidation in active addresses, transactions, and fees generated over the past 30 days. Chains like Base saw notable pullbacks in DEX volumes following a very strong run earlier in the year. Solana remains the dominant venue for onchain trading by volume, even as user activity softened slightly over the week, with BNB Chain a distant second.”\n\n“Overall, trading activity hasn’t disappeared; it has simply slowed and become more selective as the year comes to a close.”\nProfit-Taking Hits Metals After New Highs Macro investors, meanwhile, stayed focused on the policy path. Investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes due later Tuesday, a release that often resets rate expectations when positioning runs crowded.\nThe bigger picture still shows a strong year for risk assets, despite the late-year wobbles. The MSCI All Country World Index has climbed about 21% in 2025, and a broad measure of Asian stocks has rallied almost 26%, according to market-wrap data.\n\nIn metals, the latest move showed how quickly crowded trades can unwind. Spot silver fell 4.8% on Monday after earlier hitting a record, and gold eased after setting its own peak on Friday, with profit-taking doing the heavy lifting.\nFor crypto, Bitcoin’s steadiness looked more like a positioning pause than a conviction push, with traders watching liquidity, flows and volatility pricing for the next move into the first week of 2026.\nRead original story Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Holds $87k As Asia Rally Stalls, Wall Street Tech Slips by Shalini Nagarajan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tech Stocks Aren't Always The Answer\n\nDerek Lewis\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIf there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s undoubtedly true over the past decade, it&rsquo;s that technology stocks have been blistering hot.\nAnd it&rsquo;s been for very understandable reasons &ndash; many of these companies&rsquo; products have entirely changed the way the world behaves. People stay solely connected through digital channels such as social media, students are now taking their exams online, and consumers are even utilizing digital apps that allow for grocery delivery.\n\nBut while all that sounds fun and exciting, many have overlooked simple businesses that aren&rsquo;t overly flashy. This includes companies that take care of waste management, provide staffing uniforms, and even energy drink providers, to give a few examples.\nMany of these companies fall into the Consumer Staples sector, whose businesses face steady demand across many economic conditions. In other words, people will want their trash picked up no matter the state of the economy, and we all obviously enjoy our caffeine buzz.\nAnd perhaps to the surprise of some, these non-technology companies have seen wildly strong performance, with their lower beta nature providing nice shields against volatility.\nCintas Outperforms Meta For example, Cintas CTAS, the company responsible for providing staffing uniforms and other relevant materials to employers, has gained +830% over the last decade, which compares to a +530% gain from high-flying Meta Platforms META. Cintas&rsquo; 25% annualized return over the period even outpaces the S&P 500&rsquo;s +15.3% annualized return over the same period.\n\nAnd maybe even more shockingly, Cintas shares have nearly kept pace with even Microsoft over the last decade, with MSFT shares up +900% compared to Cintas&rsquo; +830% gain. While these investments are typically labeled as &lsquo;boring,&rsquo; their stability is undeniable.\nSimply put, you don&rsquo;t have to buy tech stocks to see great returns. Lesser-discussed companies like Cintas have built consistent, dependable growth by doing the &lsquo;simple&rsquo; things exceptionally well. Of course, they&rsquo;re likely not to impress investors given their less-flashy nature, but sometimes boring is better.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Financial terms of the deal were not announced.\nManus, which launched its first General AI Agent earlier this year, has already processed more than 147 trillion tokens and created over 80 million virtual computers. The company currently serves millions of users and businesses worldwide.\n\n\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" said Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus.\nMeta plans to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating it into Meta’s product ecosystem, including Meta AI. The acquisition will bring Manus’s technology to Meta’s billions of users and millions of businesses.\nThe Singapore-based Manus has experienced rapid growth, recently announcing it had reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue just eight months after launch, making it reportedly the fastest startup to achieve this milestone globally. The company’s total revenue run rate exceeds $125 million, including usage-based and other revenue.\n\nThis acquisition comes during what has been described as an intense year for Meta, involving an AI overhaul under CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company has been restructuring to regain ground in the AI race while reportedly developing new AI models like Mango and Avocado for 2026.\nEarlier in 2025, Meta formed Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a dedicated division headquartered in Menlo Park, California, focused on building advanced AI models that integrate deeply into Meta’s ecosystem. The division is lead by Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, a data-labelling startup Meta bought a 49% stake in for $14 billion, effectively acquiring Wang’s services.\nManus will continue to operate from Singapore following the acquisition.\nMeta has not yet responded to Investing.com’s request for comment.\nRelated articles\nMeta acquires Manus to expand AI agent capabilities\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Buy Stock in the Mag 7 Hyperscalers or Are They Spending Too Much?\n\nShaun Pruitt\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAlthough they are among the world’s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\nThis includes Amazon AMZN , Alphabet GOOGL , Meta Platforms META , and Microsoft MSFT , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\n\nThere is no doubt that “hyperscaling” is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns Notably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billion.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nROIC Comparison With Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market’s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\nAmazon’s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance Magnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon’s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon’s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\n\nStory Continues\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts Amazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500’s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Down 40%, This Growth Stock Could Be Set for a Recovery in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:20 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points Shares of Oracle are down big from the all-time high they reached in August.\nOracle's AI spending could be viewed as reckless or a bold bet worth taking.\nOptimists about Oracle's new direction should view the stock as attractive.\n10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›\nShares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) , the database and cloud computing specialist, have kept pace with the S&P 500 in 2025 -- up 17% year to date at the time of this writing, compared to a 17.5% gain in the index. But the tech giant's stock is down about 40% from its all-time high (made in August of this year).\n\nIn hindsight, Oracle's stock probably ran up too far, too fast in a short period, driven by exuberance for its cloud computing deals with OpenAI , Meta Platforms , and other notable companies. But the sell-off is overblown.\nHere's what investors are getting wrong about Oracle and why the stock is a great buy for 2026.\nOracle's divisive transformation Financial markets often struggle to price companies undergoing a transformation. After all, investor expectations stem from what a company does and what it is expected to do in the coming years. And if a company is doing something completely different, there's more uncertainty, which can lead to volatility.\n\nEnter Oracle, a legacy database services company looking to become a cloud computing titan with the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet 's owned Google Cloud.\nOracle's legacy software business is a stable cash cow. But Oracle doesn't generate nearly enough cash flow to cover the massive capital expenditures (capex) needed for building AI infrastructure. So it has turned to the debt markets to fund its massive expansion, which is needed to fulfill $523 billion of remaining performance obligations (RPO).\nThe capex-to-revenue metric shows the relative size of a company's spending within the context of its revenue. Just a few years ago, the major hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon had roughly 0.1 to 0.15 capex-to-revenue ratios, meaning they were raking in around 7 to 10 times more revenue than they were spending on capex. Those ratios have increased as hyperscalers ramp up their spending on artificial intelligence (AI). But Oracle is on another level -- with a capex-to-revenue ratio at a sky-high 0.58.\nOracle is spending so much on AI that its free cash flow (FCF) has turned negative. And that has a lot of investors worried that Oracle is taking an unnecessary gamble on AI. Oracle's credit risk has increased, and it could face a downgrade by ratings agencies to the lower bound of investment grade or possibly even just outside investment grade.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Oracle did mention multiple times on its Dec. 10 earnings call that it is committed to maintaining its investment-grade rating. These fears are arguably already reflected in the stock price. And investors are overlooking the most critical detail about Oracle's debt load: the timeline.\nAn end in sight for Oracle's cash burn Oracle is now more than halfway through building 72 multicloud data centers that embed its database services into third-party clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle expects Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue to ramp up substantially in fiscal 2028, which overlaps with calendar year 2027, as the bulk of its data centers will come online. This is also the time period when Oracle's five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI begins.\nOracle Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Ken Bond said the following when discussing Oracle's negative $10 billion in second-quarter fiscal 2026 FCF on its Dec. 10 earnings call:\nIn sum, Oracle is in the midst of a temporary boom in capex that should soon translate to FCF. It's not a company in a burgeoning industry bleeding cash in the hopes that it can turn profitable down the line.\nTherefore, the biggest risk to Oracle isn't necessarily its debt load or the timeline for converting capex to FCF to pay off debt, but rather, if its customers actually come through on their commitments to pay for OCI services.\n\nOpenAI's $300 billion deal is massive, even within the context of Oracle's $523 billion in RPO. However, even if OpenAI retracts some of that commitment or spreads it out over a longer period, I still believe Oracle will have no shortage of customers to redirect that capacity.\nOracle is a top AI growth stock to buy in the new year Oracle's stock price could be volatile until it proves to investors that it can convert AI capex into FCF. Right now, OpenAI is playing a major role in that narrative because it is potentially Oracle's largest customer. But Oracle doesn't need OpenAI to succeed.\nOracle's data centers are purpose-built for high-performance computing. Its multicloud data centers reduce latency and costs and boost performance by embedding database services within third-party clouds rather than moving large data sets across clouds. So, OCI can be more cost-effective and achieve better performance than its peers.\n\nWith that advantage in mind, it stands to reason that Oracle should be able to win business from other hyperscalers, possibly even OpenAI's top competitors, such as Anthropic, the company behind the Claude AI assistant and large language models.\nWith Oracle stock trading at a26.6 forward price-to-earnings ratio, the market seems to have already digested Oracle's risks, but it is downplaying its potential -- especially the speed at which Oracle could begin paying down debt with FCF. All told, Oracle stands out as a high-conviction growth stock to buy for 2026, but only for risk-tolerant investors who can withstand high volatility.\nShould you buy stock in Oracle right now?

      "Content": "Creator Capital Markets: How Pump.fun Changed Streaming in 2025\n\nRyan Gladwin\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:01 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: PUMP36507-USD\n\nSOL-USD\n\nMETA\n\nThis time last year, the Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun had disabled its livestreaming feature after creators flooded the platform with videos of dangerous stunts in attempts to pump their tokens.\nNow, Pump.fun views streamers as the future of its platform, with plans to take on other livestreaming competitors head on: “Our plan is to kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana,” the company posted on X in July.\n\nThe move is being billed as “ creator capital markets ”—the idea that viewers can help fund their favorite creators while having a stake in the future of their content via a crypto token. It’s a stark contrast from the traditional model, which mostly relies on viewers donating money to creators, with little to nothing in return.\nPump.fun turbocharged this vision when it revamped its fee structure in September to feed more of the fees it generates from each trade to token creators’ pockets. This resulted in some streamers earning tens of thousands of dollars over just a couple days as their content went viral.\nBut the initial momentum soon crashed back down to reality as it became clear that creators and traders made the most money when they leaned into crazy stunts. And Pump.fun found itself back where it started, with a model that incentivizes creators to walk the line of controversy. Now the industry is reflecting on how to change that.\n\nLivestreams return On April 4 , Pump.fun rolled out its updated streaming feature to 5% of its users with revamped user guidelines and a bolstered moderation system. It then slowly expanded the feature to more users, making sure it didn’t get out of control as it did in 2024.\nTwo months later, crypto influencer Jake “ SolJakey ” Hillhouse launched Basedd House , a content crew full of up-and-coming influencers living together in a frat-like house with weekly episodes and meme coins attached to each character. It’s from this that now-established creators made their name, like the wacky Iseem and crypto rapper Whish . Pump.fun directly funded the whole venture, Hillhouse previously told Decrypt .\n\nOther creators and viral moments started to bubble up around them in June, too.\nLeland King Fawcette became the second-fastest person to race through all 50 U.S. states , according to Fifty States Club , all while livestreaming on Pump.fun. A Ukrainian man called Ricken said the words “Pump fun” one million times on stream. And one man even livestreamed the birth of his child , and then named her “Solana”—after the crypto network that hosts the meme coin machine.\nIt was clear that Pump.fun had tapped into something with its audience, and it was then that the company began investing in what it now saw as the future of the platform.\n\nStory Continues\nPump.fun invests Pump.fun started paying people to post clips of the launchpad’s top creators, the opposite of traditional livestreaming platforms, which require their creators to source, manage, and pay these “clippers.” Pump.fun co-founder Alon Cohen told Decrypt this was a bet on “stimulating social activity” in the hopes of incentivizing more adoption of crypto-native livestreaming.\n\nBut it was in September, when Pump.fun revamped its fee model to increase the earnings of creators on the platform tenfold, that streaming started to explode. On one day in September, Pump.fun handed out over $4 million in creator fees, according to Dune data. This meant that streamers, who create their own meme coins attached to each viral (they hope) event, no longer had to sell their own supply of these tokens to make good money.\nPump.fun then doubled down on its livestreaming bet. It began shipping out streamer backpack kits to help creators boost the quality of their streams. The launchpad also hired an unknown number of recruiters, who helped Pump.fun offer contracts to traditional content creators.\nAlec Strasmore , a former assistant to musician Post Malone , was one of these recruiters. Stasmore told Decrypt in September that he would approach content creators in the traditional space who had big audiences but were struggling to monetize effectively, and introduce them to Pump.fun and help onboard them.\n\nThe exact terms of these streamer contracts remain undisclosed. A source familiar with these deals, however, told Decrypt that the contracts included commitments to streaming time, token supply control, and were usually short-term—weeks and months, rather than years. This helped prompt a stream of well-known influencers outside of crypto to join the platform.\nChad Tepper, a former member of Jake Paul’s influencer crew Team 10, who has millions of followers across social media , was one of those who joined Pump.fun. Others, like retired League of Legends esports player Michael “ BunnyFuFuu ” Kurylo, also joined the platform.\nUsually, these tokens would debut with an immediate surge in price, as the content creators' audience bought into the token. More often than not, though, it didn’t last—the hype would eventually fade and the tokens would then slowly trend downwards.\n\nThese scenarios resulted in streamers making big bags during the first few days of trading (BunnyFuFu made over $130,000 in fees in his first three days), before their fees tapered off as trading volume plummeted. (BunnyFuFu only made $29,000 in the three months following). The short shelf life didn’t just hurt creators—traders and viewers also made less money over time.\nAnd, as a result, many of these traditional streamers and creators have since stopped streaming on Pump.fun.\nFormer Pump.fun Dev Sentenced to Six Years in Prison for $2 Million Solana Fraud\n“A lot of those didn't work out. Maybe the best course of action is to not go spend a shit ton of money on Web2 streamers,” Hillhouse told Decrypt , referring to streamers outside of the crypto or “Web3” space. “But you do get those few that matter, that now become a proof of concept,” he said, pointing to Misfits boxer B Dave and TikTok influencer Minikon as shining examples. Both creators ’ tokens are down over 90% from highs set shortly after launch.\n\n“Moving forward, I don’t think [Pump.fun] should be doing that again,” Hillhouse said, suggesting any future deals need to be “more long-term.”\nVirality matters But Pump.fun’s biggest success stories this year came from its homegrown talent: Hillhouse’s Basedd House, the random degens looking to break world records on the site , and the Bagwork boys.\nIn September, two dudes, Chris and Mike, created a token called Bagwork and then livestreamed various stunts to work those bags. The first stunt was relatively mild, running onto the field during a baseball game. They then went mega viral after filming themselves stealing gym influencer Bradley Martyn’s hat and getting slapped for it. The Bagwork token surged 2,000% as a result, netting the duo $49,000 in fees. All it took was just one viral video.\n\nJust days later, the pair leaked unreleased songs from rapper Drake, which brought the Bagwork brand international recognition—and legal trouble, in the form of an apparent cease and desist notice. This stunt earned the Bagwork boys $83,000 in fees over just two days.\nBut the token fell victim to the same ailment that many meme coins before it suffered: once the attention, hype, and controversy fade, so does the price. Bagwork is currently down 96% from its all-time high market cap of $53.8 million, back during the Drake leaks, and now sits at $1.9 million, according to DEX Screener .\nIn an interview with Decrypt , Mike from Bagwork called that period “the best few days of my life.” He thought he was about to turn into one of the “biggest and richest” streamers in the world. As the attention waned, though, he realized there is “definitely a little bit of an issue” with Pump.fun streamers “needing crazier content to pump their tokens.”\n\nSolana Dev Hospitalized With Third Degree Burns Trying to Pump Meme Coin\nHillhouse agreed that something isn’t right with the current model. He suggested more community activations that require tokens, such as voting on what a creator does on stream.\nPump.fun did not respond to Decrypt ’s request for comment on how the company plans to address this tension.\nIt may be make or break for creator capital markets in the coming year. Will Pump.fun find a way to fix its reliance on sensationalist viral moments? Or will creator capital markets fade into obscurity, like the many meme coin trends before it?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2025 was the year AI got a vibe check\n\nRebecca Bellan\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nSCAI.PVT\n\nMoney was no object for the AI industry in early 2025. A vibe check crept in the second half of the year.\nOpenAI raised $40 billion at a $300 billion valuation. Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machine Labs raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech.\n\nSuch astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta shelled out nearly $15 billion to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending.\nThe first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace.\nThe era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment?\n\nWe’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself.\nHow the year started The biggest AI labs got bigger this year.\nIn 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a Softbank-led $40 billion round at a $300 billion post-money valuation. The company also reportedly has investors like Amazon orbiting with compute-tied circular deals, and is in talks to raise $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation . That would bring OpenAI close to the $1 trillion valuation it is reportedly seeking in an IPO next year.\n\nOpenAI rival Anthropic also closed $16.5 billion this year across two rounds, its most recent raise pushed its valuation to $183 billion with heavy hitters like Iconiq Capital, Fidelity, and the Qatar Investment Authority participating. (CEO Dario Amodei confessed to staff in a leaked memo that he was “not thrilled” about taking money from dictatorial Gulf states).\nThen there’s Elon Musk’s xAI, which raised at least $10 billion this year after acquiring X , the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk also owns.\nWe’ve also seen smaller, new startups get a hypey boost from froth-mouthed investors.\n\nStory Continues\nFormer OpenAI chief technologist Mira Murati’s startup Thinking Machine Labs secured a $2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation despite sharing almost no information about its product offering. Vibe-coding startup Lovable’s $200 million Series A earned it a unicorn horn just eight months after launching; this month, Lovable raised another $330 million at a nearly $7 billion post-money valuation. And we can’t leave out AI recruiting startup Mercor, which raised $450 million this year across two rounds, the latest bringing its valuation up to $10 billion .\n\nThese absurdly large valuations are still happening even against the backdrop of still-modest enterprise adoption figures and serious infrastructure constraints, heightening fears of an AI bubble.\nBuild, baby, build For the larger firms, those numbers aren’t coming from nowhere. Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure.\nThe result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding with Nvidia . In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage.\n\nSome of the biggest deals this year powering the infrastructure boom were:\nBut cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently pulled out of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be.\nWhether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers – including calls from figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders to rein in data center expansion – are already slowing projects in some regions.\nEven as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype.\nThe expectation reset In 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout .\nWhile it was meaningful on paper, it didn’t land with the same punch as earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific.\n\nEven Gemini 3 , which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI – which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous ‘code red’ memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance.\nThere was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of R1, its “reasoning” model that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost.\nFrom model breakthroughs to business models As the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows?\nThat shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to sell them hyper-personalized ads . Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI , a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay.\n\nMore than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own Comet browser with agentic capabilities and paying Snap $400 million to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels.\nOpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own Atlas browser and other consumer-facing features like Pulse , while also courting enterprises and developers by launching apps inside ChatGPT itself.\nGoogle, for its part, is leaning on incumbency . On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like Google Calendar , while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting MCP connectors to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge.\n\nIn a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat.\nThe trust and safety vibe check AI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025. More than 50 copyright lawsuits wound through the courts, while reports of “AI psychosis” – the result of chatbots reinforcing delusions and allegedly contributing to multiple suicides and other life-threatening episodes – sparked calls for trust and safety reforms.\n\nWhile some copyright battles met their end – like Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement to authors – most are still unresolved. Though the conversation appears to be shifting from resistance against using copyrighted content for training, to demands for compensation (See: New York Times sues Perplexity for copyright infringement ).\nMeanwhile, mental health concerns around AI chatbot interactions – and their sycophantic responses – emerged as a serious public health issue following multiple deaths by suicide and life-threatening delusions in teens and adults after prolonged chatbot usage. The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots .\n\nPerhaps most telling: the calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects.\nIndustry leaders have warned against chatbots “ juicing engagement ,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional over-reliance on ChatGPT.\nEven the labs themselves started sounding alarms. Anthropic’s May safety report documented Claude Opus 4 attempting to blackmail engineers to prevent its own shutdown. The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy.\nLooking ahead If 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value.\nThe era of ‘trust us, the returns will come’ is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia.

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nEllie Diamond\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: FIG\n\nSTLA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAAPL\n\nThere are countless articles and profiles of entrepreneurs who dropped out of college. Fortune magazine recently featured several, including Figma CEO Dylan Field and Scale founder Lucy Guo, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire woman, who built her own fortune.\nInnovators like these young people make the news because they’re inspiring, intelligent and innovative. They’re also exceptional. which can make them unrealistic role models, according to Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from experience before striking out on their own.\n\nThe Exception, Not the Rule In October 2025, two entrepreneurs took the stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin. One was John Elkann, the chair and executive director of automaking giant Stellantis [ 3 ]. During his interview with Bezos, Elkann asked what he thought of the ideal of the prodigy entrepreneur.\nThese are personalities such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Steve Jobs. Each became hugely successful after rejecting the conventional pathway to success: a college education and years of climbing the ladder .\n\nElkann didn’t take this route, and neither did Bezos. They have great respect for those who did, but Bezos is quick to point out that it shouldn’t be an expectation.\n“It is possible to be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur ,” he said. “We have famous examples of that. But these people are the exception.”\nThe numbers back him up. A Clifford-Lewis Private Wealth study found that among the top 0.1% of rapidly growing new businesses, the founder’s average age was 45 at startup. Based on its data, Clifford-Lewis estimates that entrepreneurs have a much higher chance of success at 30 than at 20.\nSee Next: I Asked ChatGPT How To Build Wealth for the Rest of Trump’s Term: Here’s Its Plan\nTrending Now: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\n\nThe Value of Professional Experience Bezos started Amazon at age 30. He had graduated from Princeton University in 1986 and worked at several Wall Street companies, including Fitel and Bankers Trust. In 1990, he became the youngest-ever vice president of hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He opened Amazon in July 1995 at age 31.\nBezos said these 10 years of working for others improved Amazon’s chances of success . He gained hands-on experience leading a growing company, and these skills helped him guide Amazon through its early days of explosive growth. In only two years, he took the company public, with an initial public offering price of $18 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nBezos now counsels young aspiring entrepreneurs to follow a similar path. As he said in Turin:\n“I always advise young people, go work at a best-practices company where you can learn a lot of basic, fundamental things: how to hire really well, how to interview, etc. There’s a lot of stuff you would learn in a great company, and there’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it”.\n\nBezos believes that these early career lessons do what pure inspiration and talent cannot: They teach young entrepreneurs how to do things right from day one. This knowledge supports better decision-making, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Ranking the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy for 2026. Here's My No. 3\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Meta is spending a lot on AI, but its free cash flow provides plenty of resources.\nAI is already paying off as Meta is seeing higher revenue and greater ad engagement.\nWith the stock down 13% in the last three months, now seems a good time to consider it.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\nNot every company has quite a history as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . Famously immortalized by the 2010 film, The Social Network (starring Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, and Justin Timberlake), Meta Platforms counts more than 3.5 billion people among its daily active users across its family of apps.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has never been one to rest on his laurels, though. The company, which changed its name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in 2021 to emphasize its focus on building the metaverse, is making massive investments in artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. As a result, the company's revenue numbers continue to climb, but there's some nervousness among bears that the company may be overspending.\nThis is the fifth installment in a series of seven articles that rank the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026. In previous articles, I identified Apple as No. 7 , Amazon as No. 6, Tesla as No. 5, and Microsoft in the No. 4 spot.\nMeta Platforms is a deserving member of the Magnificent Seven, sporting a market capitalization of more than $1.6 trillion, to be one of the biggest publicly traded companies in the world. Let's take a closer look at why Meta is deserving of the No. 3 ranking on this list of best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026.\nMeta's spending creates upside, not risk Zuckerberg knows that to make money, you have to spend money. And he's never been afraid to do that. Meta Platforms has recorded losses of $73 billion so far on its Reality Labs division, which is charged with building virtual reality and augmented reality hardware and software to support the metaverse.\n\nI confess I never saw the appeal of the metaverse, so I was as relieved as anyone when Zuckerberg finally signaled a long-overdue pivot. According to Bloomberg, Meta is planning deep cuts in its Reality Labs division as the company pivots to developing artificial intelligence. Meta stock rose 4% on Bloomberg's early December report.\nThis time, I think that Zuckerberg is getting it right. Meta already has some massive platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, that have huge followings and tons of engagement. With its Meta AI assistant, the company can deliver personalized content and ads, including those powered by generative AI tools. Meta's Llama large language model enables users to create and interact with AI personas, providing more engagement across its family of apps.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd Meta's AI tools are having an immediate impact on the company's bottom line. Revenue in the third quarter totaled $51.24 billion, up 26% from a year ago. Net income fell from $15.68 billion to $2.70 billion, but that was only because of a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion that was required by the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Meta says excluding the charge, income would have increased to $18.64 billion.\n\nNotably, Meta recorded $50.08 billion in advertising revenue in the quarter, up from $39.88 billion a year ago.\n\"We are at an exciting point for our company, where we have continued runway to improve our core services today as well as the opportunity to build new AI-powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the future,\" management said in the earnings report.\nWhy Meta is No. 3 Meta is investing heavily in AI, with capital expenditures for 2025 expected to range between $70 billion and $72 billion. And that number is expected to increase in 2026, according to Chief Financial Officer Susan Li. But while other companies may struggle with that, Meta's in great shape. It generated $44.8 billion in trailing free cash flow during the third quarter, giving it the resources to invest in AI.\n\nZuckerberg wants Meta's AI spending to lead to \"personal superintelligence,\" which he describes as an AI companion that allows Meta's users to improve their relationships, automate work, encourage creativity, and help them achieve personal goals. That's an achievable goal, because that's how people are starting to use AI already.\nMeta stock is down 13% in the last three months and has been underperforming the S&P 500 for most of the year. But I think the shares are on the verge of a rebound, and are now trading at a discounted price-to-earnings ratio of less than 30. I believe that Meta stock will be a big winner in 2026, and this is an ideal place to buy a Magnificent Seven stock at a discounted price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:49 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nMeta Platforms' AI Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\nMeta Platforms is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META&rsquo;s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META&rsquo;s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms&rsquo; initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company&rsquo;s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet and Amazon , are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space\n\nMeta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\nAlphabet&rsquo;s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon&rsquo;s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nMETA&rsquo;s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\nMeta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 24.6%.\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s 6.62X. META has a Value Score of C.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.16 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, suggesting 1.75% year-over-year growth.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc.

They have made bank in Mac 7. Uh not only this year, the year before and the year before that, maybe even a couple years before. They're they're sitting on a lot of gains is what I'm trying to say. What should they be doing right now with these gains?\n00:14 George\nGood morning, Brian. Can you imagine being a short seller in this market and trying to bet against the the Mag 7 or the AI trade or anything. I mean, you get carried out. Short selling's been like the worst uh possible thesis on the market you could have the last 15 years other than maybe going long oil and gas stocks. So I I I would not bet against any of any of these complexes, any of these movements. You want to talk about earnings growth, this market's got it. A lot of the other developed countries really don't. So betting against the US has been a fool's game and I'm certainly not going to be doing it in 2026. I'm going not I'm be going to not try to time the market. I'm going to try to stay in there, stay positions as is and just trim and reallocate as as wisdom would would dictate.\n01:05 Brian\nGeorge, I just had a a guest on uh I'm doing double duty here. I was in the 9:00 a.m. hour and they were making the case for healthcare. If you had to stack up these two sectors side by side, you got uh AI plays, you got the Mac 7, healthcare. What excites you more and why?\n01:22 George\nYeah, I don't really like any of those the best. I think healthcare's seen a significant rally in the closing parts of 2025. If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits.

Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer discussed.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s shares are up by 10.7% year-to-date after having dipped by 11% in late October. The stock had its worst day in three years after the firm released its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. While the results saw Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s $51.24 billion in revenue and $7.25 in earnings per share beat analyst estimates, investors were caught off guard by the firm’s capital expenditure guidance. As part of the earnings, management outlined that the firm would spend between $70 billion and $72 billion in 2025, the low end of which was higher than the previous guidance of $66 billion. Cramer had defended the stock after the earnings as he asserted that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was positioning itself to protect against OpenAI’s potential entry into the social media ecosystem. On December 19th, Wedbush cut the firm’s share price target to $880 from $920 and kept an Outperform rating as it commented on margin contraction in 2026. For his part, Cramer continues to be an ardent believer in Meta Platforms, Inc.

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Investing in These 3 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Right Now Could Set You Up for Life\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:57 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nWMT\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms continues to dominate with its social networks while exploring AI glasses, which can become a lucrative revenue stream.\nInteractive Brokers is one of the top beneficiaries of surging interest among investors who want to beat the stock market.\nWalmart's online ads continue to gain momentum and can yield higher profit margins in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Interactive Brokers Group ›\n\nInvesting in high-quality growth stocks and gradually building your positions can turn you into a millionaire investor. It takes a while to achieve that goal, and some people look beyond the S&P 500 index to amplify their returns. These are some of the most promising stocks that can produce appealing long-term returns.\nMeta Platforms is still a top-tier ad platform Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the second-largest advertising stock , only behind Google. However, Facebook's parent company has been reporting higher financial growth rates than Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which gives it an edge for new investors.\nTop-line results continue to expand, based on the company's 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter. Meta Platforms also recently launched its AI glasses, which may turn into a valuable revenue source that diversifies the company's finances in a few years.\n\nSocial media growth remains strong, with the company reporting 3.54 billion daily active users in Q3, which represents an 8% year-over-year increase. Continued demand for Meta Platforms' family of apps will yield more ad impressions and sales.\nInteractive Brokers is riding strong demand from investors When people make more stock trades and use margin to boost their exposure to equities, brokerage firms like Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ: IBKR) come out as the big winners. Shares are up by more than 40% year to date and have more than quadrupled over the past five years. Recent earnings results suggest that the momentum can continue.\n\nInteractive Brokers increased its total revenue by more than 20% year over year in Q3, with commission revenue and net interest income as two of the biggest winners. Strong engagement drove these results, with customer account growth increasing by 32% year over year. Interactive Brokers added 4.13 million accounts while delivering stock and options trading volume gains of 67% and 27% year over year, respectively.\nInvestors are still feeling good about the stock market based on a 39% year-over-year increase in Interactive Brokers' customer margin loans. Strong demand for the stock market should help the brokerage firm continue to outperform the S&P 500 and deliver millionaire-maker returns.\n\nStory Continues\nWalmart's pivot to advertising is a long-term tailwind that will boost margins Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) has made its mark as the world's top retailer and has a real shot at exceeding a $1 trillion market cap in 2026. The company continues to boost sales and delivered 5.8% year-over-year revenue growth for investors in Q3 FY26.\nHowever, the company's advertising segment is addressing one of Walmart's biggest weaknesses. Walmart enjoys high order volumes but struggles with profit margins. The company's net margins usually hover near 3% since retail stocks aren't known for high margins. Ads can be a game changer, especially since Walmart reported 53% year-over-year revenue growth for its global advertising business.\n\nAds don't make up a large portion of Walmart's total business, but they can grow over time and boost margins. In the meantime, Walmart continues to gain market share in retail while expanding its e-commerce sales, which were up by 27% year over year. Each Walmart store acts as a distribution facility, which results in lower shipping costs and quicker deliveries.\nFew companies can compete with Walmart in terms of size, and that works well for investors who want millionaire-maker stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Interactive Brokers Group right now?

At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the Best Quality Stocks to Buy Before 2026 . According to a report by The Wall Street Journal released on December 18, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is set to release two new and significant AI developments in 2026.\n​The company is developing its next large language model called Avocado, along with a new image and video generation AI model called Mango. The chief AI officer of Meta, Alexandr Wang, noted that these models are expected to be launched in the first half of 2026. Moreover, Wang also highlighted that the company is making the next LLM better at coding. In addition, the chief AI officer also pointed out that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is in the early stages of developing World Models, which are AI models that learn about their environment through visual inputs.\n​That said, on December 18, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was reiterated with a Buy rating and a $810 price target by Bank of America. The firm noted the company’s 2026 expense guidance and its LLM launch planned for the first half of 2026 as major catalysts behind the bullish sentiment. For long-term investors, BofA suggests that they should follow the company’s returns from heavy AI spending across core apps, ad monetization, and new ventures.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

      "Content": "Beloved specialty clothing store closing after 49 years\n\nDaniel Kline\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:07 AM PST 4 min read\n\nRunning a family business for 50 years requires a lot of sacrifice.\nI grew up in a family business, Lynn Ladder & Scaffolding, which has actually existed for longer than that. When it's your family's business, there's little separation between work hours and off hours.\nAs a kid, I remember late nights when the alarm went off at corporate headquarters, and my father had to go meet the police in order to figure out what happened. When I got older and spent four years working for the business, I experienced early mornings bringing product to job sites to keep customers happy, and I learned that mixing family and business has its challenges.\n\nTo make any family business last nearly 50 years, you have to have a passion for it, and that's something Ronnie Sylvester, known as “Mr. Boot” in the Country and Western industry, had for Western clothing.\nHis store, Sylvester's Western Wear, served locals from its Louisiana store and was a regional destination as well as a tourist attraction. Sylvester ran the store until he passed away in 2020 following a battle with Parkinson’s disease.\nHis wife, Lisa Sylvester, has operated the business since.\n“My husband worked so very hard. He’s a legend.

      "Content": "I'm an 83-year-old yoga instructor. I'm not your typical grandma — I still work to feel fulfilled and supplement my Social Security.\n\nNoah Sheidlower\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 6 min read\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Barbara Brown, 83, who works as a yoga instructor in Richmond, Virginia. Brown said her work has been fulfilling, given that many of her classes are at nursing homes . Though she needs to work to supplement her Social Security , Brown said she has no intention of retiring. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started working after school at the age of 15 and have been working ever since. My family wasn't well-off and needed help, so I took it upon myself to attend college at night and work all day.\nWhile I was in school, a gentleman from JPMorgan recruited me to work for the company. I began my career as an auditor after earning my degree in accounting.\nI spent over 15 years at JPMorgan, and it was a wonderful experience, but it wasn't easy. I then worked at smaller companies as a controller, overseeing accounting operations. I also worked for entertainment companies and startups in New York.\nBusiness Insider's \"80-over-80\" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. If you are 80 and older and still work, fill out this form to contribute to the series.\n\nRead our capstone story from the series and watch our video .\nI moved to Richmond about 20 years ago. My husband got sick and had a stroke, so we moved here because my son was going to college here. Richmond is very different from New York, but I found a job at a visual arts place, where I stayed for about 10 years until 2009.\nAfter retiring from that job, I became a yoga instructor, and I'm still running my business full-time at age 83.\nI've always done yoga I did so especially when I worked on Wall Street to keep my nerves together. In Richmond, I started doing a lot of yoga while I was working, and it came to a point where I thought I'd like to be a teacher, as I was getting older.\nI took my vacation time and spent two weeks at an ashram. I returned six months later to complete my training.\n\nI earned my first certification as a 200-hour yoga teacher and got a job at the Y, where I taught a class during my lunch hour in 2009. I then retired from my full-time job. I distinctly remember my last day, when I boxed everything up and then went to teach my yoga class . I never really stopped working.\nI would travel to cafés to teach seniors, and I taught at studios. I made it my business to teach everywhere and continue to study.\n\nStory Continues\nI led yoga retreats, taking people overseas to countries like Costa Rica and Guatemala. I would teach twice a day, and we would have vegetarian meals. I did that for seven years, in addition to my regular teaching.\nNow, I'm concentrating on teaching at nursing homes I have five nursing homes that I travel to, and I'm grateful because it's a great experience for me, as a person over 80 , to be in the shape I'm in. I visit several places where people experience memory loss, so I have developed a technique to teach them.\nThey love music, so I go in with a drum and get them singing. It's fascinating that people with memory loss often recognize familiar tunes. I can give them a laugh, and even with some loss, they can benefit from yoga.\n\nI teach chair yoga, so I don't have to get down on a mat. I can sit in the chair and demo to the class what needs to be done. I still privately teach one person on the mat who comes to my house.\nThere's a woman who never moves, and they put her in my class, and I looked over and saw her moving her hands and feet. It's a truly rewarding experience to see that I'm making a positive impact on people's lives.\nI can also work with young people — I can work with anybody. It's just that I couldn't work with young people constantly because I'd have to be on the mat, and that would be too much for my body, so this works for me.\nI'm not like the average yoga teacher. I've handled all the finances for my business and haven't asked anyone for help. I hope to continue teaching for as long as possible.\n\nI'm also a vegan, and I follow a very strict diet I've been vegan for over 35 years. It isn't very expensive to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, and I don't eat a lot. Seeing so many people in the conditions that they're in, many of whom are younger than me, I wish a lot of them would eat a better diet.\nI don't take any medications. At my last physical, I was told my vital statistics put me at age 40. I don't feel old. When I went to the chiropractor, one of the staff members asked me how old I was. I said, I'm not going to tell you, because then you put me in a range.\n\nI'm not working just for the money because I really love it, but I need the money to help me financially I work to supplement my Social Security , which would not be enough on its own.\nI bought a house to rent out, but when COVID-19 broke out, the renters didn't pay me for seven months. I'm still paying back my credit cards. I also have a mortgage on my own home.\nBecoming a yoga teacher is also extremely expensive. I could have never done it now. It costs around $10,000 to start, and then you have to keep up with ongoing learning. Even yoga clothes are expensive, and it's a very upscale activity.\n\nI have a son and three grandkids My schedule is so busy that I'm not a typical grandmother. I'm not baking cookies and cooking for my grandkids, though I do see them often. Once I finish teaching, I rest, because it is a lot of energy, especially for an older body. I do some breath work when I come home.\nEverybody has had challenges of all kinds. Losing my husband and my mother was very hard. I stay in the moment, not looking back or regretting. My time is spent creating. What can I do now to create a better life and to help others have a better life?\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Financially independent investors swear by this overlooked passive-income stream. Here’s why some call it ‘easy’ money\n\nJessica Wong\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nPassive income is more than Airbnb side hustles and dividend stocks . There’s another moneymaker that’s earning savvy investors money on the side.\nIt’s called private money lending, where everyday people — not banks or hedge funds — are pulling in returns just by wiring cash to local real-estate investors who need quick funding.\n\nBut how exactly does private money lending work, and is it right for you?\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nBenefits and risks of private money lending Think of private money lending as short-term, high-interest loans for real-estate deals. In this case, a private lender isn’t an institution like a bank, credit union or government-backed mortgage provider; it’s an individual or business that lends their own money.\nBecause they aren’t regulated like traditional banks, private lenders have more flexibility and they often focus on the value of a property instead of a borrower’s credit score or employment history. (1)\n\nFlippers, renovators, and buy-and-hold investors often need to close quickly, sometimes faster than a traditional bank will allow. So they borrow from private lenders instead, and pay for the privilege.\nA recent Business Insider article shared the story of Carl and Mindy Jensen, an early-retired couple who built a $5 million net worth. They’ve dabbled in different investment strategies, but one of their favorites is private lending. (2)\n“Private lending generates such a nice return that it's difficult to be like, ‘No, we don’t want the easy money,’” Mindy Jensen told Business Insider.\nAnother real-estate investor, Josh Lupo, was also featured in the article and said that interest rates of 10 to 12% are considered “normal” and 12 to 15% is common on shorter loans of around three to six months. The lender typically sets the terms.\n\n\"It takes us 30 minutes driving to the bank, wiring the funds, and then the investor that is borrowing the money sends us updates, and that's the extent of it,” Lupo told the website.\nBenefits High returns. You’re not pulling 12% from even the best high-yield savings accounts, and most rentals aren’t a short-term cash infusion. Private lenders like Lupo routinely see 12% on six-month loans or 15% on three-month deals, often backed by real estate.\n\nStory Continues\nHands-off investment. Private lending is an attractive option for older investors who’ve paid their dues unclogging toilets, replacing water heaters, and dealing with tenants. They still want real-estate-style returns, but without the headaches. Private lending keeps them in the game without the stress of being landlords.\n\nQuick turnaround. Real-estate investors love private lenders just as much. Speed is everything in the real estate game. Investor Mike Gorius told Business Insider he can close in eight days with private lenders compared with 30-plus days and a stack of paperwork when dealing with a bank (2).\nRisks Risk of default. If a borrower stops paying, you’re on the hook. Even though the deal is backed by real estate, there’s no guarantee you’ll recover your initial investment, especially if the borrower bails mid-project. You may also have to manage the foreclosure process.\nProperty-value risk. Private money loans may be secured by a house or building, but if values dip, the collateral may not cover what’s owed. In markets where After Repair Values (ARV)s get overly rosy, lenders can get left holding the bag.\n\nLiquidity and timing headaches. These deals are short-term, which means the borrower has to repay or refinance fast. If the market slows or a project hits delays, your money is stuck. And you can’t just sell your position since once that cash is in, it’s basically locked up. (3)\nRead More: This is the quiet portfolio shift many wealthy investors are making in 2026 . Should you consider it too?\nHow to get started If you think private lending is for you, you can get started using this roadmap:\nBuild capital first. Private lending requires cash, and while there’s no minimum, you’re looking at an average of between $50,000 and $250,000. (4)\nWhether it’s through house hacking, a rental or two, side hustles, dividend investing, or just saving aggressively, you’ll need to have some money ready to lend to get into the game.\n\nGet involved in your local real-estate scene. Relationships are key. The more investors you meet, the more deals you’ll be exposed to. Attend meetups, local investor events, and flip/wholesaler gatherings.\nStart small, scale smart. Most savvy private lenders grow by starting with a small loan, getting a good experience under their belt, lending again to repeat borrowers, and gradually levelling up to bigger deals. (5)\nThat said, if you want property exposure without the property headaches, private lending isn’t the only option to explore:\nREITs. Buy shares of real-estate investment trusts , collect dividends and stay hands-off.\nFractional ownership. Own slices of rental homes without ever talking to a tenant.\nCrowdfunded real-estate deals. Collectively invest in big commercial or residential projects using real estate crowdfunding investment platforms.\n\nGrocery-anchored commercial real estate. Grocery-anchored shopping centers can be surprisingly recession-resistant , and a smart diversifier.\nIf you’ve built up capital, want to earn some passive income, and love the idea of being the bank instead of the buyer, private lending might be the next big move in your portfolio. Just make sure you vet the deal and review your risks before handing over your money.\nYou May Also Like This $1B private real estate fund is now accessible to non-millionaires.

      "Content": "This Biotech Is Up 194% in a Year but One Investor Took Millions Off the Table\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:56 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INDV\n\nKey Points Oregon-based Stonepine Capital Management reduced its Indivior stake by 250,000 shares in the third quarter.\nThe overall position value fell by about $2.75 million from the previous period.\nAs of September 30, the fund reported holding 100,000 INDV shares valued at $2.41 million.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nOregon-based Stonepine Capital Management reported a sale of 250,000 shares of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ:INDV) , reducing its position by approximately $2.75 million, according to a November 13 SEC filing.\nWhat Happened According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated November 13, Stonepine Capital Management sold 250,000 shares of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ:INDV) during the third quarter. The transaction led to a decrease in the fund’s position value by approximately $2.75 million, bringing its Indivior holding to 100,000 shares worth $2.41 million at quarter-end.\n\nWhat Else to Know Stonepine's Indivior position now represents 1.96% of reportable AUM, down from 5.06% the previous quarter.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:VSTM: $23.58 million (19.17% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:ADMA: $10.83 million (8.81% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:EOLS: $9.43 million (7.67% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:ZVRA: $7.70 million (6.26% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:NKTR: $4.84 million (3.93% of AUM)\n\nAs of Friday, Indivior shares were priced at $36.21, up a staggering 194% over the past year and vastly outperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 15% in the same period.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of Friday)\n$36.21\nMarket Capitalization\n$4.53 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.18 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$124.00 million\n\nCompany Snapshot Indivior PLC develops and markets buprenorphine-based prescription drugs for opioid dependence, as well as treatments for substance use disorders, opioid overdose, and schizophrenia. Key products include SUBLOCADE, SUBUTEX PRO, SUBOXONE, OPVEE, and PERSERIS.\nThe company generates revenue primarily through the sale of branded pharmaceutical products, with a focus on long-acting injectable therapies and sublingual formulations targeting opioid use disorder and related conditions.\nIndivior's primary customers are healthcare providers, treatment centers, and government agencies addressing opioid addiction and mental health disorders in the United States and international markets.\n\nIndivior PLC is a specialty pharmaceutical company with a leading position in the treatment of opioid use disorder and related behavioral health conditions. The company leverages a diverse portfolio of proprietary therapies and invests in innovative pipeline assets targeting substance use and mental health disorders.\n\nStory Continues\nFoolish Take After years of volatility, Indivior finally looks like a company with operational momentum, and that’s exactly when position sizing starts to matter most for long-term investors. In the third quarter, Indivior posted $314 million in revenue, with SUBLOCADE sales up 15% year over year to $219 million, driving a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $120 million. Management raised full-year 2025 guidance sharply, now calling for $1.18 billion to $1.22 billion in revenue and as much as $420 million in adjusted EBITDA, while laying out a plan to generate at least $150 million in annual operating expense savings beginning next year.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, trimming a position after a 194% one-year run looks less like doubt and more like portfolio math. Stonepine remains concentrated in small and mid-cap biotech names, and even after the sale, Indivior still represents meaningful exposure relative to peers like ADMA, Eton, and ZVRA. Ultimately, Indivior’s fundamentals are improving, and the stock now reflects much of that progress. From here, returns hinge less on turnaround hope and more on sustained growth, cost discipline, and execution beyond this year.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable AUM: Assets under management that must be disclosed in quarterly SEC Form 13F filings by institutional investment managers.\nAUM (Assets Under Management): The total market value of investments managed on behalf of clients by a fund or firm.\nNet position change: The difference in the number or value of shares held in a security after a transaction.\nTop holdings: The largest investments in a fund’s portfolio, typically ranked by market value or portfolio percentage.\nQuarter-end: The last day of a fiscal quarter, often used as a reference point for financial reporting.\nBranded pharmaceutical products: Medications sold under a trademarked brand name, as opposed to generic versions.\nLong-acting injectable therapies: Medications administered by injection that release their active ingredients over an extended period.\nSublingual formulations: Medicines designed to be placed under the tongue for absorption into the bloodstream.\nOpioid use disorder: A medical condition characterized by problematic opioid use causing significant impairment or distress.\nPipeline assets: Experimental drugs or therapies a company is developing but have not yet reached the market.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $2 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTSLA\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom each have market caps around $1.6 trillion.\nAI is the driving force behind all three stock prices.\nOne of these tech leaders is seeing immediate results from AI spending, and its stock valuation is more attractive right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is responsible for adding trillions of dollars in value to a handful of companies over the last few years. Nvidia , for example, briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year, thanks to its dominant position in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). Four other companies sit firmly above the $2 trillion threshold as we approach the new year.\nBut three AI stocks currently have similar market caps around $1.6 trillion as of this writing, and are vying to become the first new $2 trillion company of 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Here's my prediction for the next company to top the milestone, and it could come as soon as next year.\nArtificial intelligence is fueling all three Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom have all seen their stock prices heavily influenced by advances in AI this year.\nMeta stock climbed higher early in the year as its efforts to improve its recommendation algorithms bore fruit. Ad revenue climbed higher as time spent on its apps increased, and ads became more effective. However, the stock took a step back recently as management shared plans to increase its AI-related spending.\n\nTesla's value is heavily tied to its robotaxi service and AI innovations. The stock received a boost over the summer when it launched its robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas. Investors added to those gains on promising progress on the company's next-generation AI chip for its vehicles.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator business has gained momentum in 2025, as the company signed big contracts with OpenAI and Anthropic, the latter of which is buying Alphabet 's Broadcom-designed tensor processing units (TPUs). To that end, Alphabet and Broadcom are seeing excellent progress in shifting more developer workloads to TPUs, which offer greater energy efficiency and cost savings versus Nvidia's GPUs.\nBroadcom stock took a step back after its last earnings report, as many analysts were disappointed with management's expectation that greater AI chip sales would come at a lower gross margin.\nWhile all three of these stocks have a path to a $2 trillion valuation in 2026, I expect Meta Platforms to reach the milestone first. Here's why.\n\nStory Continues\nAI-powered earnings growth at an attractive valuation Even with its run rate of $200 billion in annual revenue, Meta is still growing its bottom line quickly. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 20% in the third quarter, and improvements in AI are the reason.\nMeta has seen an increase in both ad impressions and price per ad for eight straight quarters. That indicates that it's increasing user engagement and opening new places within its apps for advertising while making ads more effective.\n\nManagement attributes a shift in its recommendation algorithm to make it more general across formats as the primary reason users are spending more time on its apps. Meta has seen similar improvements by applying the same methodology to its advertising algorithm. In other words, bigger models have directly translated into more revenue.\nThat trend should continue in 2026, as Meta opens up more opportunities for advertising, including on Threads and WhatsApp. It could also begin monetizing Meta AI, its generative AI chatbot. The improvements in its algorithms over the last couple of years should enable it to ramp up advertising quickly without as much negative impact on its pricing as we've seen in the past.\nThe bigger opportunity for Meta in 2026, though, may be the expansion of its generative AI features. It's reportedly working on an AI agent that can manage advertising campaigns for small businesses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly talks about the opportunity to handle everything involved with creating, testing, and optimizing ad campaigns on its platform through an AI agent.\n\nAnd chatbots specializing in sales and customer service for a company could open the door for more businesses to push Facebook and Instagram users to start messaging them through Meta's chat apps.\nWith small- and medium-sized businesses accounting for the bulk of advertisers on Meta's platform, these innovations have the potential to dramatically increase the amount they're willing to spend on ads. If the overhead for these clients is much lower, they can increase their ad spending and scale up their businesses faster.\nThose efforts should fuel another year of strong revenue growth. And while depreciation expense from the increase in AI-related capital expenditures could eat into earnings growth, Meta should be able to manage continued improvements in earnings per share with the help of share repurchases.\n\nThe stock trades for just 26 times forward earnings expectations, which is much lower than Broadcom's multiple and less than one-tenth the multiple Tesla stock trades for. I expect Meta to fetch a higher earnings multiple as it proves its AI spending to be well worth it once again in 2026, pushing its valuation to $2 trillion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Ahead of 2026, According to Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Palantir)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Morningstar analysts recently ranked Nvidia and Microsoft as the two best artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\nBrian Colello at Morningstar says Nvidia has an economic moat due to its leadership in GPUs, networking, and software tools needed for artificial intelligence.\nDan Romanoff at Morningstar says Microsoft’s cloud computing unit has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence due to investments in OpenAI.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nPalantir Technologies has been one of the best-performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent years. Shares have advanced 1,000% since January 2024, but many analysts worry about its valuation. That may explain why Palantir did not appear on Morningstar 's recent list detailing the best AI stocks to buy now.\nInstead, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took the top two spots, followed by Amazon , Broadcom , and Meta Platforms . But optimism concerning Nvidia and Microsoft is not limited to Morningstar. Most Wall Street analysts believe the stocks are undervalued.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $190.\nAmong 63 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 29% upside from its current share price of $488.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Morningstar analyst Brian Colello writes:\nTo summarize, Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its full-stack strategy. The company is best known for its GPUs, chips that accelerate demanding data center workloads like AI training and AI inference. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs best-in-class GPUs with CPUs, high-speed interconnects, and networking platforms, such that the company essentially builds entire data centers.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has spent the better part of two decades creating its CUDA software platform, which comprises an unparalleled number of code libraries, pretrained models, and application frameworks that assist developers. While custom AI chips developed by Broadcom may be cheaper, the total cost of ownership is often higher because they lack pre-built software tools.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has over 90% market share in data center GPUs, a market where sales are projected to grow at 36% annually through 2033, and the company is likely to maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 48% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2028. That makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look cheap.\n\n2. Microsoft Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for Microsoft 365 (a suite that includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), the company also has a strong position in other software verticals, including business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning.\n\nMicrosoft has added generative AI copilots to several software products and monthly active users surpassed 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter. And CEO Satya Nadella told analysts, \"Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services sales. \"Azure has several distinct advantages, including that it offers customers a painless way to experiment and move select workloads to the cloud,\" according to Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff. \"Based on its investment in OpenAI, the company has also emerged as a leader in AI.\"\n\nMicrosoft owns a 27% equity stake in OpenAI and it has exclusive rights to the AI start-up's most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5). Also, The Information reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the agreement. Those payments will top $1 billion this year, up from about $500 million last year, according to TechCrunch.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% during the last four quarters, which makes the current valuation look more reasonable. Nvidia is still the more attractive option, but I think patient investors should consider buying a small position in both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Peter Thiel warns US real estate ‘catastrophe’ will deal massive blow to young Americans, but boomers might get windfall\n\nJing Pan\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 5:27 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nPYPL\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nAs a co-founder of PayPal and the first outside investor in Facebook, Peter Thiel is widely recognized for his expertise in tech. But now, the billionaire venture capitalist is sounding the alarm on an entirely different sector: real estate.\n\nDuring an interview with Commonwealth Canada, Thiel drew upon the insights of 19th-century economist Henry George to underscore the gravity of America’s real estate crisis (1).\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“The basic Georgist obsession was real estate, and it was if you weren't really careful, you would get runaway real estate prices, and the people who owned the real estate would make all the gains in a society,” Thiel said.\nThe core of the issue, Thiel explained, lies in the “extremely inelastic” nature of real estate, especially in regions with strict zoning laws.\n“The dynamic ends up being that you add 10% to the population in a city, and maybe the house prices go up 50%, and maybe people's salaries go up, but they don't go up by 50%,” he said. “So the GDP grows, but it's a giant windfall to the boomer homeowners and to the landlords, and it's a massive hit to the lower-middle class and to young people who can never get on the housing ladder.”\n\nThiel warned that this “Georgist real estate catastrophe” is playing out across many “Anglosphere countries,” including the U.S., Britain and Canada.\n‘Incredible wealth transfer’ The surge in U.S. home prices has been nothing short of alarming for non-homeowners. Over the past five years, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index has climbed by 45% (2). This indicates that, on average, the value of a single-family home in the U.S. has nearly doubled in that five-year period.\n\nThough there is reason to believe that growth could be slowing down. A Reuters poll of property experts suggests that U.S. home prices will rise just 1.4% in 2026 (3). While that increase would be relatively minimal compared to the last few years, it’s nevertheless an increase.\nThiel connected growing prices to inflation, stating, “There's a way you could talk about inflation in terms of the prices of eggs or groceries, but that's not that big a cost item, even for lower-middle-class people. The really big cost item is the rent.”\n\nStory Continues\nAt its core, Thiel argued, the issue boils down to supply and demand.\n“If you just add more people to the mix, and you're not allowed to build new houses because of zoning laws, where it's too expensive, where it's too regulated and restricted, then the prices go up a lot,” he said. “And it's this incredible wealth transfer from the young and the lower-middle-class to the upper middle class and the landlords and the old.”\n\nThiel isn’t the only one raising the alarm. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has highlighted similar concerns.\n“The real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough housing … It’s hard to find — to zone lots that are in places where people want to live … Where are we going to get the supply?” Powell said at a press conference in September.\nThe gap in the housing market is significant. The U.S. had a housing shortage of 4.7 million properties in 2023, despite having added 1.4 million new homes, according to a Zillow report (4).",

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the AI Stocks Investors Are Watching . On December 23, Baird reiterated the stock as “Outperform” and cut its price target to $815 per share from $820. Despite the price target cut, Baird believes that investors should buy the dip.\nAnalyst Colin Sebastian said that Meta has emerged as a controversial “battleground” stock following the release of its third-quarter earnings report. While near-term risks to sentiment still exist, expectations are now in better balance compared to three months ago.\nThe firm further said that mixed sentiment may persist heading in 2026, but narrative may shift to become more constructive through the year.\nMeta Platforms has been expanding its advertising capabilities and also invests heavily in artificial intelligence and the metaverse.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?\n\nJordan Chussler, MarketBeat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 1:45 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n688802.SS\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After China-based GPU manufacturer MetaX recently debuted on the Shanghai market, the stock gained 700%.\nWith investors rotating out of U.S.-listed AI stocks, the news was reminiscent of January 2025’s DeepSeek market scare.\nBut NVIDIA’s central role in the AI landscape and its strategic partnerships with companies like OpenAI nearly assures its long-term success.\nInterested in NVIDIA Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nOn Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%.\nThe company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence.\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nBecause of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion.\nAs an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance?\n\n→ These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nMetaX Is the Latest Example of a DeepSeek Market Scare On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter.\nAt the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500.\n\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nThe MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing.\nFor analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices.\nIn turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out.\n\nStory Continues\nBut it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived.\n\nNow, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX.\nWhy MetaX Isn’t the Market Threat It’s Made out to Be NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term.\nOver the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times.\n\nMetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years.\nAdditionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success.\nCompounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.”\nFund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.”\n\nNVIDIA and Its Shareholders Will Be Fine Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\nNVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon.\n\nThe stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%.\nOver the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float.\nThe article \" Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare? \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But the communications sector actually includes several major tech players, such as Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, which returned 66.6% for 2025 through Wednesday, and Meta Platforms Inc.

With about 400,000 of Vanguard’s retirement-account customers required to take RMDs, that 7% made for quite a set of IRS penalties.\n\nThe current IRS rule is that people with retirement accounts must begin taking required minimum distributions at age 73. If you are in any doubt about when to begin taking RMDs, or how to address being late or to plan ahead, you should call the company (or companies) handling your retirement accounts immediately to formulate a plan. There are many ways to handle RMDs.\nA retirement-savings opportunity Some people prepare for retirement by putting as much money as possible into tax-deferred retirement accounts every year.

Beth Pinsker dug into all the new retirement-account contribution limits and tax rules .\nIf you are self-employed, run your own company or even have a side hustle, you have an opportunity to save much more for retirement.

      "Content": "Meta Platforms Might Be the Biggest Bargain in Big Tech\n\nJoey Frenette\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nQuick Read Meta trades at 22.1x forward P/E. This is close to the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven.\nMorgan Stanley expects revenue re-acceleration from stronger ad demand and AI-improved ad performance.\nMeta is shifting from open-source LLaMA models to closed-source AI models including Avocado and Mango.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMeta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) certainly stands out as one of the bigger \"deals\" to be had in big tech for those looking to play the value side of the AI trade. Undoubtedly, when it comes to the Magnificent Seven, investors might wish to be more selective with which members of the famed group they buy going into the new year.\nWhether that's due to the variance in performance between the individual names, the different slates of expectations set ahead of them, or their potential to make up ground in this AI race, there are reasons to get pickier when it comes to the most magnificent names atop this market.\nSince it feels unlikely that the non-stop chatter about stretched stock valuations, bubbles, and all the doubts that AI can live up to its potential will pull back in the new year, investors might need to increase their tolerance for turbulence going into the new year, especially with the companies that have been spending far more than your average investor might be comfortable with.\n\nShares of Meta certainly appear dirt-cheap, but are expectations too elevated given its AI spend? At this juncture, the higher the AI spending bar, the higher the expectations bar is likely to be in the new year, and for companies like Meta Platforms, it seems like the shares are looking relatively cheap for a reason. But what happens if there are decent returns that lie just a bit further down the road that investors and analysts can't yet see?\n\nIn such a case, shares of Meta Platforms may very well be in for more consolidation or even downside before investors come to the realization that its AI strategy is paying off, perhaps many times over. Some upbeat analysts over at Morgan Stanley seem to think that the new year could be incredibly kind to the social-media juggernaut.\nNotably, they see revenue re-acceleration at the hands of stronger ad demand as well as improved performance of ads at the hands of AI. Add Reels and WhatsApp business messaging momentum into the equation, and it certainly feels like 2026 will see enough of an AI return to soothe the fears of the rising tide of AI spend.\n\nStory Continues\nAnother bull, Colin Sebastian, over at Baird, also thinks 2026 could be a good year for Meta Platforms shares. He thinks new AI models (think closed-source Avocado and Mango models, as Meta Platforms moves on from its open-source LLaMA model) might help push the name to $815 per share. Undoubtedly, the sudden and surprising shift from open-source to closed-source models might be a head-scratcher for some. Either way, it seems to be the right way to go, especially given industry trends.\n\nThe bottom line I think Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg can deliver more than a few surprises in the new year, as the company potentially looks to give investors what they want over the near- to medium-term while also ensuring enough is spent on the long-term opportunity at hand. On the one hand, some of the bears see the firm as spending a bit too much on AI efforts. On the other hand, some skeptics might see Meta Platforms as \"lagging\" in the AI race.\n\nUndoubtedly, there's room to catch up if Meta AI is to catch up to the likes of the current leaders. Either way, it's just too easy to be bearish on the stock right here. And that's why the stage might be set for a big rally that helps shares catch up to the rest of the Mag Seven after a rough, but still positive (shares up 11% year to date) year.\nAt the time of this writing, Meta Platforms' shares are going for 22.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). That's the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven, thanks in part to the nasty decline the stock encountered back in October.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Meta Platforms' AI-Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMeta Platforms META is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META’s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\n\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META’s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms’ initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company’s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN, are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\n\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space Meta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nAlphabet’s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon’s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nStory Continues\nMETA’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Meta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 24.6%.\nMETA’s Stock Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector’s 6.62X.

      "Content": "Is ORCL Stock Poised for Growth Amid Rising AI Infrastructure Demand?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nOracle ’s ORCL positioning in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market presents a complex investment picture as the company navigates unprecedented demand against escalating capital requirements. The database software provider reported second-quarter fiscal 2026 results that underscored both the opportunity and challenge ahead.\n\nCloud infrastructure revenues surged 68% year over year to reach $4.1 billion, with GPU-related revenues jumping 177% as customers secured computing capacity for AI workloads. Total remaining performance obligations climbed 438% to $523 billion, driven primarily by commitments from major technology companies, including Meta and NVIDIA. The metric expanded by $68 billion sequentially during the quarter, reflecting accelerating contract signings.\n\nHowever, the aggressive expansion strategy carries significant financial implications. Oracle now projects capital expenditures of approximately $50 billion for fiscal 2026, up from an earlier $35 billion estimate and substantially above the prior year's $21.2 billion. Free cash flow turned negative by approximately $10 billion in the November quarter, exceeding analyst expectations by a considerable margin.\n\nThe company's collaboration with the Department of Energy, announced in December 2025, and its flagship Stargate supercluster project with OpenAI demonstrate Oracle's infrastructure ambitions. The recently unveiled Zettascale10 system promises multi-gigawatt AI capacity, connecting hundreds of thousands of GPUs across distributed data centers.\n\nWhether Oracle can convert its substantial contract backlog into profitable revenue streams while managing debt levels remains the central question for investors evaluating the stock's growth potential amid surging AI infrastructure demand.\n\nHyperscaler Rivals Accelerate AI Infrastructure Investments Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN are pursuing parallel AI infrastructure buildouts with significantly higher capital commitments. Microsoft projects $120 billion in capital expenditure for 2026, anchored by Azure's sustained growth momentum between 31% and 40% throughout 2025. Microsoft's AI services contributed nearly 20 percentage points to Azure's expansion as the company deepened its OpenAI partnership. Amazon announced plans to spend $125 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from $83 billion in 2024, with the vast majority directed toward AI infrastructure for AWS. Amazon's strategic focus includes custom Trainium and Inferentia chips to reduce reliance on third-party GPU suppliers. Both Microsoft and Amazon maintain stronger balance sheets compared to Oracle's leveraged position, though Amazon faces uncertainty around monetizing its custom silicon investments.\n\nStory Continues\nORCL’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Oracle have lost 6.1% in the past six-month period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 20.4% and the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s 1.6% decline.\nORCL’s 6-Month Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, ORCL stock is currently trading at a premium with a trailing 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 34.77x, which is higher than the industry average of 34.19x. Oracle carries a Value Score of D.\nORCL’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $7.33 per share, marking an upward revision of 7.6% over the past 30 days.

This is the biggest transaction Nvidia has made so far to buy anything. The goal of the move is to make Nvidia more competitive in the quickly increasing market for AI hardware and data centers.The business will use Groq's specialized chip designs in future products and hire Jonathan Ross, the startup's CEO, and other top engineers. Ross was part of the team that started Google's own AI chip initiative.The deal is part of a larger wave of investments worth billions of dollars that are changing the AI infrastructure environment. Recently, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta, and Amazon have made big promises to increase their AI processing power and work with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and CoreWeave.Analysts argue that Nvidia's partnership with Groq will help it stay ahead of AMD, Intel, and bespoke chipmakers in the AI accelerator market by giving it access to more technologies. The transaction also supports Nvidia's plan to improve vertical integration as demand for AI computing keeps going up until 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Sector Rotation: 2 Smart Money Moves for 2026\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:15 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: XLC\n\nUNH\n\nXLV\n\nMETA\n\nNFLX\n\nKey Points The recent shift in interest rate policy is encouraging institutional investors to move capital into undervalued sectors with strong cash flows.\nCommunication services stocks offer a compelling mix of reasonable valuations and earnings growth driven by resilient digital advertising spending.\nThe healthcare sector offers a unique combination of defensive stability and explosive growth potential from pharmaceutical innovations.\nInterested in Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has officially shifted gears. By lowering interest rates in mid-December 2025, the Fed sent a decisive signal to the global markets. For the better part of the last year, the stock market narrative was dominated by hardware and semiconductors. Investors poured billions into the companies building the physical infrastructure of artificial intelligence (AI). However, as borrowing costs drop and the economic temperature begins to cool, the market is entering a new phase.\nWe are witnessing a sector rotation. This phenomenon occurs when large institutional investors, the smart money, move capital from one area of the market to another to adapt to changing economic conditions. The capital that fueled the hardware rally is now looking for new homes. Specifically, investors are targeting sectors that offer a combination of reasonable valuations, steady cash flow, and defensive stability.\n\n→ Vertical Aerospace Traded a Delay for a Major Advantage\nTwo specific areas are emerging as winners in this new environment: Communication Services and Healthcare. By analyzing the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLC) and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLV), investors can identify opportunities to build a portfolio with a strong outlook heading into 2026.\nThe Mechanics of the Market Shift To understand why this rotation is occurring, investors must examine how interest rates affect business valuations. When rates are high, investors tend to favor companies with massive immediate cash flows or speculative growth. But when rates fall, the playbook changes. Lower interest rates make dividend-paying stocks more attractive because they compete more effectively with bonds. Simultaneously, lower rates reduce the cost of debt for companies that rely on borrowing to fund operations.\n\n→ Forget The Chips: Oracle Wins Phase 2 of AI\nThis creates a Goldilocks scenario for specific sectors. The market is broadening. The narrow leadership of a few massive tech companies is giving way to a wider array of opportunities. Analysts at major financial firms have already adjusted, or are beginning to adjust, their ratings to reflect this. They are pivoting toward sectors that have sat on the sidelines during the semiconductor frenzy, strategically realigning their portfolios to capture the next leg of projected growth.\n\nStory Continues\nCommunication Services: Growth at a Discount One of the primary beneficiaries of this rotation is the Communication Services sector. Multiple firms, including RBC Capital, recently upgraded this sector to Overweight, a rating that suggests they expect these stocks to outperform the broader market averages. The argument for this sector is built on relative valuation. While hardware stocks trade at historically high multiples relative to earnings, communication services stocks appear far more reasonably priced.\n\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nThe Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) is the primary vehicle for this trade. While still a technology-heavy investment, the XLC focuses on Service Tech (software, media, and search) rather than physical chips.\nThe fund is heavily concentrated. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) together account for roughly 40% of the portfolio. This concentration brings specific advantages.\nDigital advertising spending has remained surprisingly resilient, providing a steady stream of revenue for these top holdings.\nFurthermore, these companies are shifting from spending on AI to monetizing it. By using AI to make advertising algorithms more efficient, they are boosting profit margins.\n\nBeyond the giants, the fund also includes major entertainment companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Disney (NYSE: DIS). As the streaming wars stabilize and these companies focus on profitability over subscriber growth, they add another layer of value to the fund. This mix of advertising dominance and media consolidation makes XLC an attractive option for growth-oriented investors.\nHealthcare: The Defensive Growth Engine On the other side of the spectrum lies the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) . Historically, healthcare is viewed as a defensive sector. Demand for medical care is inelastic; people require prescriptions, surgeries, and insurance coverage regardless of whether the economy is booming or entering a recession. This stability makes XLV a critical anchor for portfolios during periods of uncertainty.\n\nHowever, the 2026 iteration of XLV offers more than just safety. It includes a significant growth kicker driven by pharmaceutical innovation.\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has grown to become the fund's largest holding, representing roughly 15% of the ETF.\nThis dominance is mainly due to the explosive global demand for GLP-1 medications used for weight loss and diabetes management.\nThis single innovation has decoupled the fund from the slow-growth reputation of traditional healthcare.\nThe fund is also diversified beyond pharmaceuticals. It holds significant positions in health insurance providers such as UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) and medical device manufacturers such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO).\nThese companies benefit from the Silver Tsunami, the aging global demographic that requires increasing levels of medical care. While there are risks, such as potential government policy changes regarding drug pricing, the sector generally exhibits lower volatility than the wider market. This means XLV tends to fluctuate less violently than the S&P 500, offering a smoother ride for investors.\n\nThe Income Factor: Dividends and Yields For investors rotating into these sectors, income plays a vital role. Both XLV and XLC recently went ex-dividend on Dec. 22, 2025. This technical term simply means the cutoff date for the latest cash payment has passed. Consequently, the share prices of both funds adjusted downward yesterday. This is a standard accounting procedure: the cash that is about to be mailed to shareholders is no longer part of the company's value, so the stock price drops by that exact amount.\n\nWhile new investors missed the Dec. 24 payout, the yields remain a key attraction. XLV currently offers a dividend yield of approximately 1.6%, while XLC sits closer to 1%. In a lower-interest-rate environment, these regular cash distributions are valuable. They act as a buffer against price declines. When these dividends are reinvested to buy more shares, they compound returns over time.\nThe Barbell Strategy: Balancing Risk and Reward The divergence between Communication Services and Healthcare allows investors to deploy what is known as a barbell strategy. This approach involves balancing two distinct asset types to manage risk.\nOn one end of the barbell is XLC . It captures the upside potential of the digital economy, with a heavy weighting toward the growth engines of Google and Meta. It is the offensive player in the portfolio, designed to capitalize on positive market sentiment.\n\nOn the other end is XLV . It provides a solid floor, supported by essential human needs and breakthrough science. It is the defensive player, designed to protect capital and provide income if the economic landing gets bumpy.\nRather than viewing these sectors as competing alternatives, investors should view them as complementary. As the economic landscape shifts in 2026, combining the aggressive earnings momentum of Service Tech with the defensive reliability of Healthcare offers a prudent way to navigate the market. By stepping out of the crowded hardware trade and into these diversified sectors, investors can position themselves for a balanced and profitable year.\nThe article \" Sector Rotation: 2 Smart Money Moves for 2026 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The authority's published tally showed Asfura with 40.3% of the vote versus 39.5% for Nasralla, with ruling-party candidate Rixi Moncada trailing at 19.2%. The result came more than three weeks after election day, following repeated allegations of irregularities from Nasralla and Moncada, and was formally released after markets closed on Christmas Eve, a timing that may have limited the immediate risk of unrest.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with META.\nIs META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nNasralla rejected the outcome in a livestream on Facebook ( NASDAQ:META ) and TikTok, calling the vote a fraud and saying results were declared without all ballots being counted, while also alleging manipulation in congressional and mayoral races. He compared the situation to Venezuela's disputed election last year under Nicolas Maduro and referenced Honduras's own 2017 election, which triggered deadly protests after a result widely viewed as fraudulent. Even so, Nasralla said he would pursue peaceful and legal avenues rather than mobilizing supporters in the streets, framing his response as an effort to defend the vote without escalating tensions.\n\nFrom an investor perspective, early market signals suggested cautious optimism. Honduran bonds rallied after Asfura, a civil engineer and former two-term mayor of Tegucigalpa, took the lead in preliminary counts, reflecting expectations of a more market-friendly agenda. Asfura has pledged to cut red tape, seek new free trade agreements, and promote large infrastructure projects, including a liquefied gas pipeline linking Mexico, El Salvador, and Honduras, alongside fiscal incentives aimed at attracting foreign direct investment. He has also said he would reverse Honduras's 2023 decision under President Xiomara Castro to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing, instead prioritizing closer relations with the US, Taiwan, and Israel. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was quick to congratulate Asfura, a development that could align with support he received from Donald Trump in the days leading up to the vote, even as Honduras's long history of electoral controversy continues to shape the political and investment backdrop.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 25)\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThis year, one of the better performers among the Magnificent 7 had been Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ: META ). But its third-quarter earnings report raised investor concerns about the company’s massive capital spending on artificial intelligence initiatives. In addition, Meta says it plans to make significant cuts to the budget of its Reality Labs metaverse division in the coming year. The stock is down 13.6% since the quarterly report was released.\n\nStrong quarterly reports earlier this year (despite a tax charge) had lent credence to the claim that Meta would continue to outshine its competitors over the next year. The share price hit an all-time high of $796.25 back in August. Due to the recent pullback, the stock is up 4.9% year over year, underperforming the broader market. Furthermore, the near-term future of the economy is uncertain—just like the markets themselves—and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a controversial figure. Certainly, Zuckerberg's sudden shift to the metaverse and brand name change to Meta Platforms raised a few eyebrows several years ago.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Meta Platforms Inc.’s ( NASDAQ: META ) AI push has been a key driver for the company in 2025, with integrations coming across numerous platforms, which is fueling engagement and increasing ad sales.\nDespite economic cloudiness, Meta announced that its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) estimate increased significantly, much of which will be allocated to AI project development and integration.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNow, the Meta Platforms CEO is shifting the company's focus and riding a powerful, bullish trend. Against this complex backdrop with many moving parts, investors should consider the wide range of Meta stock price targets and formulate a strategy for all possible outcomes. To help, 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis. Let's jump in.\nWhy Invest in Meta Platforms? Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room. Investors should not rely on Meta Platforms' Reality Labs metaverse business to drive the company's near-term future growth. In Q3 2025, Reality Labs generated $470 million in revenue, up from $370 million in revenue in the prior quarter. However, during that same time frame, Reality Labs recorded a loss from operations of $4.43 billion.\n\nFortunately, it appears that the CEO's attention has turned to a different tech field lately. In particular, Zuckerberg seems to expect AI to be Meta Platforms' key driver going forward. AI integrations into Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp could provide an economic moat for Meta Platforms if new features translate to greater user engagement. WhatsApp, in particular, has seen notable growth with more than 3 billion monthly users now.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta's AI focus evidently helped the company succeed in the third quarter of the year despite losses in its metaverse business. Impressively, Meta Platforms grew its revenue 26% year over year to $51.2 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus call for $49.5 billion. Furthermore, excluding a one-time tax charge, the company's earnings per share (EPS) surged 20% to $7.25, easily outpacing the analysts' consensus estimate of $6.74.\n\nThere's no doubt that Zuckerberg is all-in on the AI revolution now. He envisions a future in which AI will be used for \"a lot\" of \"social tasks.\" And he believes it's \"really compelling\" that AI will \"get to know you better and better.\" Some reporters have expressed skepticism of an AI-infused future. Yet, if Meta Platforms can parlay machine learning into profits, investors shouldn't dismiss the growth potential of Meta stock.\nAnother key driver for Meta Platforms is its Threads short-form messaging platform. Granted, Threads is still playing catch-up to the popular X platform, which is owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Still, Threads is making inroads as its monthly active user count grew from 320 million in 2024's fourth quarter to 350 million in Q1 of 2025. That's not at the level of X, which reportedly has more than 580 million monthly active users. Yet, perhaps AI feature integration can make Threads even more competitive with X in the coming quarters.\n\nThe company expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenue to range from $56 billion to $59 billion. That is expected to be driven primarily by ongoing strength in its advertising business, bolstered by the positive impact of AI-driven enhancements to ad targeting and user engagement across its family of apps.\nMeta Platforms as a Stock It is impossible to know how the economy will perform going forward. Similarly, it remains unclear whether Meta Platforms will achieve significant returns on its AI investments. These unknowns will not stop analysts from publishing their Meta stock price predictions, though.\nOppenheimer and Benchmark downgraded the stock following the third-quarter earnings release, citing increased capex concerns. However, BofA Securities has reiterated its Buy rating on the shares, keeping its price target at $900 and affirming long-term confidence in Meta, citing its user base and potential AI integration opportunities. Cantor Fitzgerald also reaffirmed its positive stance by reiterating an Overweight rating and $920 price target. It anticipates that improvements in AI execution will lead to a \"sentiment reversal\" for the company in 2026.\n\nThe aforementioned uncertainties are reflected in the wide range of Wall Street analysts' price targets for Meta Platforms. The Zuckerberg-led firm has a high price target of $1,117.00, a median price target of $837.15, and a low target price of $685.00. However, the consensus recommendation of 67 analysts covering the stock remains to buy shares.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$685.00\n2.6%\nMedian\n$837.15\n25.4%\nHigh\n$1,117.00\n67.3%\n\nMeta Platforms 2026 Outlook Meta Platforms raised its 2025 capex estimate from a range of $66 billion to $72 billion to a range of $70 billion to $72 billion. By now, you can probably guess what Meta Platforms is spending those extra billions on. If you guessed AI, you are correct. More specifically, Meta Platforms' management anticipates \"additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.\"\n\nHence, the multi-billion-dollar question is whether Meta Platforms can effectively leverage its costly AI enhancements. That's difficult to predict. The same goes for the state of the economy, which might not support an increase in ad spending if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate in the remainder of this year.\n24/7 Wall St.'s Meta forecast is a more bullish than the mean forecast, calling for the share price to rise to $935.29 by the end of next year. That implies a run of 40.1%. It is based on the company’s ability to sustain strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency. This should drive its bottom line despite higher capital expenditures for AI objectives.\nUltimately, your price target for Meta Platforms stock should depend on whether you expect the company to take full advantage of ramped-up AI features. If so, then get ready for Meta Platforms stock to eventually head for new all-time highs. However, it may be a bumpy ride along the way.\n\nMeta’s Heavy AI Spending Justified Says Pro.

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaires Are Buying an AI Stock That Could Be the Apple of the 2030s\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Meta recently debuted its first pair of augmented reality smart glasses, a stepping stone along a roadmap that leads to fully-immersive glasses powered by superintelligence.\nJust as smartphones have replaced personal computers for many tasks, Mark Zuckerberg says smart glasses will displace smartphones as our primary computing devices in the future.\nMeta dominates the nascent smart glasses market, and it could become a consumer electronics giant if it successfully integrates its devices with a superintelligence system.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized mobile computing when it launched the first iPhone in 2007. Since then, smartphones have gradually become our primary computing devices, but it stands to reason that another technology could eventually fill that role.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is betting on smart glasses. The company currently earns the vast majority of its money by selling targeted ads across its social media properties. But smart glasses developed by its Reality Labs business unit could eventually become a major source of revenue, especially with assistance from its Superintelligence Labs unit.\nThe following hedge fund billionaires, all of whom outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three years, bought shares of Meta Platforms in the third quarter.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management added 793,500 shares. Meta Platforms is his eighth-largest holding, excluding options.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors added 1.4 million shares. Meta Platforms is his fourth-largest holding, excluding options.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management added 355,900 shares. Meta Platforms is his largest holding.\nHere's what investors should know.\nWhy Meta Platforms could be the Apple of the 2030s In September, Meta Platforms launched its first augmented reality (AR) smart glasses, which feature a built-in display on the right lens. The glasses, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, also integrate the artificial intelligence assistant Meta AI. While analysts do not anticipate earthshaking sales, they do see the product as an important stepping stone toward the Orion glasses.\n\nMeta first announced Orion in 2024 and is reportedly working toward a product launch in 2027. Orion smart glasses will have a built-in display on both lenses, creating a true holographic experience that blends the digital and physical worlds. Meta eventually plans to pair Orion with a superintelligence system, an AI assistant that surpasses human intelligence and can teach itself.\n\"Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote earlier this year. \"Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.\"\n\nStory Continues\nZuckerberg does not mean we will abandon smartphones in the future. Instead, he thinks AR smart glasses (paired with superintelligence) will be our go-to devices. For instance, personal computers are still very useful, but smartphones have replaced them for various tasks. Zuckerberg thinks smart glasses will displace smartphones in much the same way.\n\nImportantly, Meta has been investing in smart glasses for years, and Zuckerberg says the company is \"several years ahead\" of its closest competitors. Indeed, Meta accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025, up from 66% in the second half of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research.\nIf everything comes together as Zuckerberg expects -- meaning AI smart glasses become our primary computing devices, and Meta maintains its leadership position in the market -- Orion could be as successful as the iPhone, if not more so. In that scenario, Meta could become the Apple of the 2030s as it evolves into a consumer electronics giant.\nWhy Meta Platforms stock is worth buying today In the near term, the investment thesis for Meta Platforms centers on its status as the second-largest ad tech company, a position derived from its dominance in social media. Facebook and Instagram generate consumer data on a large scale, creating a network effect that makes Meta's content recommendation and ad targeting engines increasingly effective over time.\n\nMeta Platforms has invested in artificial intelligence to reinforce that network effect. New AI-powered recommendation and ranking systems are deepening user engagement and improving ad conversion rates (i.e., more clicks) by showing people more relevant content across its social media properties. Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan writes, \"Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share.\"\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842.50 per share. That implies 26% upside from its current share price of $665.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

These 29 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.\nNebius Group Investment Narrative Recap To own Nebius, you have to believe that demand for high performance AI infrastructure will stay strong enough for the company to scale capacity, execute its mega-deals with Microsoft and Meta, and move toward sustainable profitability despite heavy capital needs and stock volatility. The Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 launch reinforces that core thesis by putting Blackwell Ultra into production, but it does not materially change the key near term catalyst of capacity build-out and delivery against those contracts, or the biggest risk around funding and execution.\n\nAmong recent announcements, the multi year Microsoft AI infrastructure agreement, valued at over US$19 billion, is the most relevant context for Nebius AI Cloud 3.1. The new Blackwell Ultra based platform and real time capacity tools are what Nebius must lean on to reliably serve that take or pay style contract, which in turn underpins expectations for rapid revenue growth and heightens the importance of managing capital intensity and customer concentration.\nBut while the growth story is appealing, investors should also be aware that customer concentration and funding needs could...\nRead the full narrative on Nebius Group (it's free!)\nNebius Group's narrative projects $3.2 billion revenue and $428.7 million earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Nebius Group's forecasts yield a $159.29 fair value , a 75% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives Thirty one members of the Simply Wall St Community currently see Nebius’s fair value anywhere between US$15.07 and US$159.29, reflecting sharply different expectations.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk weighed in on an AI debate, siding with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis after Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: META ) outgoing AI chief Yann LeCun dismissed the idea of \"general intelligence\" as an illusion.\n\nMusk Weighs In On AGI Debate Musk amplified Hassabis' rebuttal to LeCun in a post on X , writing simply, \"Demis is right,\" throwing his support behind the DeepMind chief in a widening public dispute over whether artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a meaningful concept.\nThe exchange underscores growing divisions among leading AI researchers over how intelligence should be defined — and whether human intelligence itself can be considered \"general.\"\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nHassabis Says Brains Are Fundamentally General Hassabis pushed back strongly against LeCun's statement that there is \"no such thing as general intelligence,\" arguing that LeCun is conflating general intelligence with the idea of universal intelligence.\nIn a detailed post, Hassabis said human brains are among the most complex systems known and are, by design, highly general learning machines.\n\nWhile acknowledging that no real-world system can escape some degree of specialization, he said the architecture of the human brain — much like modern AI foundation models — is capable of learning any computable task in theory, given sufficient time, memory and data.\nHe added that humanity's ability to invent chess, science and modern engineering, despite evolving for survival tasks like hunting and gathering, demonstrates the breadth of human intelligence rather than its limits.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nLeCun Calls Humans Extremely Specialized LeCun also responded to Hassabis' criticism, saying the disagreement is largely semantic.\n\nStory Continues\nHe objected to equating \"general\" with \"human-level,\" arguing that humans are deeply specialized systems optimized for efficiency in narrow domains.\nWhile conceding that the human brain is theoretically Turing complete, LeCun said it is highly inefficient for most computational problems under real-world constraints.\nHe also argued that the brain can represent only a vanishingly small fraction of all possible functions, making true generality impossible in practice.\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump’s $100,000 H-1B Visa Application Fee Upheld by Judge\n\nMadlin Mekelburg\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:18 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTCS.BO\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge said the Trump administration can move ahead with a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, providing a setback for US technology companies that rely on hiring skilled foreign workers.\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell said in a ruling Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s effort to radically increase the cost of the popular visa is lawful. The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Broadcom's Semiconductor Growth Picks Up: A Sign of More Upside?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:02 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nGOOG\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nBroadcom ’s AVGO Semiconductor revenues are benefiting from strong demand for XPUs, which are a type of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) necessary to train Generative AI (Gen AI) models. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI revenues surged 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. XPU adoption accelerated in the reported quarter as enterprises continue to use these to train their large language models and monetize their platforms through inference APIs and applications. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are major users of these XPUs.\n\nAVGO’s expanding clientele, which now includes Anthropic, is driving growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received a $10 billion order to sell Alphabet’s latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received an additional order worth $11 billion from the same customer. The company’s current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as AVGO’s latest 102-terabit per second Tomahawk 6 switch continues to gain traction. AVGO now expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 AI revenues to double year over year to $8.2 billion.\n\nAVGO’s networking portfolio is gaining from strong demand for Tomahawk 6 products, as well as the Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router. Broadcom also has a rich partner base that includes the likes of OpenAI, Walmart, NVIDIA, Canonical, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, among others. AVGO expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 Semiconductor revenues of $12.3 billion, suggesting 50% year-over-year growth. Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to grow 2% year over year to $6.8 billion.\n\nAVGO Faces Tough Competition in the Semiconductor Market Broadcom is a major player in the semiconductor market, but is facing stiff competition from NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for Gen AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues from Data Center (accounted for 89.8% of NVDA revenues) jumped 66% year over year and 25% sequentially to $51.22 billion.\n\nMarvell Technology is benefiting from the strong demand environment across the data center end market. MRVL’s data center end-market revenues jumped 39% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, propelled by strong growth across AI-driven demand for custom XPU silicon and electro-optics interconnect products. Marvell Technology’s AI-driven custom silicon business has secured more than 20 multi-generational XPU and XPU-attach socket wins. MRVL’s design pipeline has expanded to more than 50 opportunities worth $75 billion, underscoring hyperscalers’ growing reliance on Marvell’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nStory Continues\nAVGO’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Broadcom shares have appreciated 45.7% in a year, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nAVGO Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe AVGO stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/earnings of 33.89X compared with the broader sector’s 27.78X.

The the four names that we've identified as top picks for the year are Amazon, Meta, Mercado Libre, and uh DoorDash. And we have more overweight ratings than those, but those four really stand out.\n00:24 Speaker A\nAnd and talk to us a little bit about why. I mean, when you're talking about Meta, uh and and others, what's the what are the driving forces going into 2026?\n00:40 Scott\nSo you have um in in each case, you know, a period of under performance related to um mostly investment cycles. You know, Amazon has spending around AWS and AI infrastructure, which is going to start I think to pay off in 2026. and you're going to see an acceleration in the AWS business, which investors will like and that should help the stock perform. Meta, you know, is on the very front end of an investment cycle. Growth is extremely strong and I think as investors get more visibility to the spend uh and into the second half of 2026, that stock's going to recover uh quite nicely because the dollars are going to be proven to be well spent. And then Mercado Libre and DoorDash also similarly that there's they're spending to grow. You know, we had a period of digestion in 2022 and a period of operating leverage in this sector in um in 23 and 24. As we've entered 25 and gone through 25, it's normalized and in 26, you're starting to see investment cycles again. There's nothing wrong with that. I just think it creates an opportunity in terms of the pullback in the stocks that when you get to the other side of the investment cycle, you get to experience excess returns. So, it's a very back half weighted uh set of recommendations that we think will perform well over the next 12 months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
