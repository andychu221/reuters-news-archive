      "Content": "A Once-in-a-Decade Investment Opportunity: The 3 Best AI Stocks to Buy in January 2026\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMETA\n\nPSTG\n\nJPM\n\nKey Points Nvidia's graphics processing units are the industry standard in artificial intelligence infrastructure, but the company is truly formidable due to its full-stack strategy.\nMeta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve engagement and advertising conversion rates across its portfolio of industry-leading social media properties.\nPure Storage is a leader in enterprise storage solutions, and its all-flash arrays pack more storage density and greater power efficiency than any competing product.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) promises to be the most transformative technology of the decade, if not all of human history. Analysts have compared the AI revolution to other major inflection points, including the advent of the internet, the introduction of the smartphone, and the invention of the microprocessor.\nHowever, AI is being adopted much more quickly than all of those technologies. Indeed, Stephanie Aliaga at JPMorgan Chase writes, \"In the first half of 2025, AI-related capital expenditures contributed 1.1% to GDP growth, outpacing the U.S. consumer as an engine of expansion.\"\nHere's why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , and Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG) are my picks for the three best AI stocks to buy in January 2026.\nNvidia: 32% upside implied by the median target price Nvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that speed up compute-intensive data center workloads like analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). But the company is truly formidable because it complements its GPUs with CPUs, networking platforms, and an unparalleled ecosystem of software tools that assist developers with building applications.\n\nConsequently, while custom AI accelerators developed by competitors like Broadcom are generally cheaper, Nvidia systems frequently have a lower total cost of ownership because the company can optimize performance across most facets of the data center computing stack. Additionally, custom chips lack pre-built software tools, which means they must be built from scratch.\nMorningstar analyst Brian Colello says Nvidia's vertically integrated business model that spans data center hardware and software affords the company a wide economic moat. \"In the long run, we expect tech titans to strive to find second sources or in-house solutions to diversify away from Nvidia in AI, but these efforts will, at best, only chip away at Nvidia's AI dominance.\"\n\nNvidia's adjusted earnings increased 60% in the third quarter, and Wall Street estimates earnings will increase at 67% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 46 times earnings look cheap. Indeed, among 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share, implying 32% upside from its current share price of $189.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms: 29% upside implied by the median target price Meta Platforms is the second-largest ad tech company in the world. The company has an almost unparalleled ability to source consumer data because it owns four of the six most popular social media properties as measured by monthly active users. That data continuously informs content ranking and ad targeting systems to improve the user experience.\n\nMeta has developed several artificial intelligence products, from custom AI chips that reduce dependence on Nvidia GPUs to proprietary machine learning models that optimize the performance of ad impressions. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says \"higher quality and more relevant content\" has led to deeper engagement across Facebook and Instagram.\nMeta's earnings increased 20% in the third quarter (excluding a one-time tax charge) and Wall Street estimates adjusted earnings will increase 21% in 2026. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings a fair price for patient investors. Among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $840 per share, implying 29% upside from its current share price of $650.\nPure Storage: 45% upside implied by the median target price Pure Storage builds all-flash storage systems and adjacent software that lets enterprises manage file, block, and object storage across private and public clouds. The company has distinguished itself with DirectFlash technology, which eliminates many inefficiencies and bottlenecks associated with traditional solid-state drives by managing raw flash memory at the array level rather than the device level.\n\n\"Our DirectFlash modules deliver two to three times the storage density and consume from 39% to 54% fewer watts per terabyte than our closest competitors today,\" according to the company. Consultancy Gartner recently recognized Pure Storage as the technology leader in enterprise storage platforms, listing automation features, data management capabilities, and strong customer satisfaction as key strengths.\nThe all-flash array market is forecast to grow at 16% annually through 2033 as the AI boom continues. Pure Storage's adjusted earnings increased 16% during the third quarter, but Wall Street anticipates an acceleration to 23% annually through the fiscal year ending in February 2027. That makes the current valuation of 39 times earnings look reasonable.\n\nIndeed, among 23 Wall Street analysts, Pure Storage has a median target price of $100 per share. That implies 45% upside from its current share price of $69.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Is This a Rare Buying Opportunity for Amazon Stock?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 10:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon has multiple high-growth business segments, despite low stock returns in 2025.\nThis mismatch presents a buying opportunity, especially as Amazon continues to harness artificial intelligence.\nAmazon's online ads are boosting margins while catching up to Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a reliable long-term performer, but the growth stock didn't have a spectacular 2025. The growth stock only gained 5% despite strong financial results throughout the year, and this mismatch makes Amazon look promising.\nIt has made great strides in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), four industries that are poised for long-term growth. That's enough to warrant a closer look, and when you dig into recent results, Amazon's stock seems undervalued at current levels.\nOnline ads can boost margins Amazon's margins have received a massive boost in recent years as its business diversifies beyond online retail. While Amazon Web Services has taken center stage in the company's long-term plans, investors should also consider the growth in Amazon's online advertising segment.\nThat part of the business was up by 24% year over year in Q3, reaching $17.7 billion. Although ad revenue is a little less than 10% of Amazon's total revenue, it is a high-margin business. Amazon is also competing with tech giants Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) with online ads. Meta Platforms earned $51.2 billion in Q3, while Alphabet brought in $65.9 billion from ads.\n\nAmazon's ad business is catching up to the two adtech leaders. It's still growing at a great pace despite the one-year stock gains not reflecting that.\nArtificial intelligence enables multiple tailwinds While some AI stocks are speculative, Amazon is already making money with this technology. Amazon Web Services revenue growth has accelerated and achieved a 20% year-over-year growth rate, returning to 2022 growth levels, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\nArtificial intelligence requires more cloud computing, and that has resulted in more companies turning to Amazon Web Services. Amazon's cloud platform also lets businesses build AI agents.\n\nAmazon is also using internal Trainium2 chips to power parts of its cloud platform. Trainium2 AI chips can reduce Amazon's chip costs, making it easier for the company to expand its AI presence. These same AI chips are generating strong demand and can become another valuable segment under Amazon's corporate umbrella. For instance, Trainium2 AI chips grew by 150% sequentially and are now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is also using AI to enhance its offerings, such as its online marketplace. AI lets Amazon present personalized product recommendations and display ads that are more likely to get clicks.\nThe tech giant's stock price movements over the past year do not reflect the quality of the business. Amazon's overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year in Q3, while net income rose by 38% year-over-year. Both of those rates are higher than the stock's one-year return, which may set the stage for a 2026 rally.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Perplexity CEO Says On-Device AI Threatens Data Centers As Industry Faces '$10 Trillion Question' — Apple, Qualcomm Positioned To Benefit\n\nMohd Haider\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 7:30 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nPEAI.PVT\n\nQCOM\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAravind Srinivas , CEO of Perplexity AI , which is backed by Jeff Bezos and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), issued a contrarian warning about the future of artificial intelligence, saying on-device intelligence running on personal devices could disrupt the centralized data center model driving massive infrastructure investments.\n\nLocalized AI Could Upend Data Center Industry “The biggest threat to a data center is if the intelligence can be packed locally on a chip that’s running on the device and then there’s no need to inference all of it on like one centralized data center,” Srinivas said in a podcast interview with Prakhar Gupta released last week.\nSrinivas, who has previously worked at OpenAI , Google Brain , and DeepMind , said that AI running directly on personal devices could reduce the need for centralized data centers .\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n“That really disrupts the whole data center industry like it doesn’t make sense to spend all this money $500 billion, $5 trillion whatever on building all the centralized data centers across the world,” he said, calling it a “$10 trillion question, hundred trillion dollar question.”\nHe also highlighted scenarios where AI running locally could learn from repeated tasks on individual devices, adapting over time and automating user activities.\n“It adapts to you and over time starts automating a lot of the things you do. That way you don’t have to repeat it. That’s your intelligence. You own it. It’s your brain,” Srinivas said.\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nChip Companies and OEMs Positioned to Benefit Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has “a massive advantage” due to its M1 chips and power-efficient devices, according to Srinivas. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and original equipment manufacturers, including Apple, Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ), Lenovo (OTC: LNVGF ), and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ ) could also benefit from distributing AI-enabled devices.\n\nHowever, technical barriers remain. Srinivas noted that no AI model has yet been released that can run efficiently on a local chip while completing tasks reliably.\nThe Indian-born entrepreneur expects early adoption on MacBooks or iPads before reaching smartphones.\nImplications For Robotics And Labor He also discussed the potential for AI in the physical world, especially in robotics. Srinivas said AI could transform the labor market by automating many tasks now done by humans, echoing concerns raised by Geoffrey Hinton who is often called the ‘Godfather of AI’.\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nIndustry Risks The U.S. economy is becoming increasingly reliant on AI, raising concerns about a potential AI bubble. If such a bubble bursts, centralized data centers could become a “ single point of failure ,” with widespread economic repercussions.\nSrinivas’s caution highlights a crucial question for the AI and tech industries: will centralized data centers continue to be the foundation of the digital economy as AI becomes more dispersed, or will intelligence on personal devices radically transform the sector?\n\nRead Next: Missed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs?

      "Content": "2 Genius Stocks This Billionaire Is Loading Up on for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 6:34 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points Microsoft is positioned to capitalize on the massive AI buildout.\nMeta Platforms sold off despite a strong quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nDaniel Loeb and Third Point Management have posted an impressive track record since the company's founding in 1995. When they make moves in the market, investors should pay attention, and two stocks they bought in the third quarter look like great investment picks.\nThanks to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements, we know that Third Point added to its Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) positions during Q3. Both moves are significant and indicate that the hedge fund believes these two stocks have strong upside.\nMicrosoft From the second quarter to Q3, Third Point added 700,000 shares of Microsoft. That nearly tripled its position in the stock, indicating huge confidence. Microsoft is a key player in the artificial intelligence realm, and this addition shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.\nWhile Third Point could be buying Microsoft for its underlying business, it could also be adding shares as a way of proxy-investing in OpenAI. Because OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, isn't a public company, owning Microsoft is one of the ways investors can gain OpenAI exposure. Microsoft reportedly owns about 27% of OpenAI, and with rumors swirling that OpenAI could go public sometime in 2026, that could result in Microsoft's stock spiking if OpenAI goes public.\n\nEven without that catalyst, Microsoft's base business is thriving, with its Office products seeing strong growth due to Copilot adoption and its cloud computing business, Azure, being a top option to build AI models in.\nWall Street analysts expect Microsoft to post solid gains over the next few years, with fiscal year 2026 (ending June 30, 2026) and FY 2027 revenue growth expected to be about 16% and 15%, respectively. That's market-beating growth, making it fairly obvious why Daniel Loeb and Third Point want exposure to Microsoft.\nI think Microsoft will continue to be a strong AI pick, and investors can follow Loeb's trade with confidence.\nMeta Platforms Money managers aren't required to report their end-of-quarter holdings until 45 days after the quarter closes, so the information we are dealing with from Third Point is as of Sept. 30, the end of the third quarter.\nUnfortunately for Meta shareholders, the stock is down around 10% since then. This sell-off occurred because of a poorly received Q3 earnings report, highlighting how much money Meta plans to spend on data center capital expenditures during 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIt wouldn't surprise me if Third Point loaded up on the stock in the fourth quarter, though we won't know until it submits its next filing. The reason I think Third Point likely added to its position during Q4 is that Meta's core business was quite strong during that time frame. Despite the stock plummeting following the Q3 earnings announcement, Meta's revenue rose an impressive 26% year over year. This shows the strength of its underlying ads business in the social media space, and is a trend that likely won't slow down anytime soon.\nAfter the sell-off, Meta trades for an attractive 22 times 2026 earning estimates.\nFor comparison, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) trades for 22.3 times forward earnings estimates. With Meta trading at a discount to the broader market, I think that this indicates it's a great time to buy the stock. After all, it's putting up market-beating growth quarter after quarter, so this decline should be temporary.\n\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Cuban explained that many patients end up paying full retail prices during their deductible phase, even though PBMs claim to negotiate lower costs.\n\nThat’s how Cost Plus Drugs came to life . It offers transparent pricing on prescription medications with a flat 15% markup.

It was the second-best year overall for the stock, and it delivered higher returns only in 2009, when U.S. markets soared following the brutal selloff in the previous year.\nTo be sure, not many expected GOOGL to have such a splendid performance last year. It was a combination of factors that supported the stock’s rally.\n\nMore News from Barchart ‘We’ve Done Our Country a Great Disservice’ by Offshoring: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang Says ‘We Have to Create Prosperity’ for All, Not Just PhDs\nMicron Stock Just Moved Into Overbought Territory After Massive 2025 Run.

Subscribe today!\nWhy Did GOOGL Stock Rise 65% in 2025? To begin with, GOOGL entered 2025 with quite tepid valuations as markets questioned its ability to protect its turf from artificial intelligence (AI) upstarts, particularly OpenAI. Depressed valuations laid the groundwork for a rally, which was bolstered by the company’s strong performance across its various businesses.\n\nIts search and cloud businesses performed quite well last year, with the latter continuing to gain market share at Amazon’s (AMZN) cost. At the end of September, Alphabet had a cloud backlog of $155 billion, representing a 46% year-over-year (YoY) increase.\nAlphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) emerged as a key growth driver last year, and Anthropic announced plans to buy a million of these. Reports suggest that Meta Platforms (META) is also in talks to buy chips worth billions of dollars from Alphabet.\nAlphabet’s progress in AI also accelerated last year with Gemini 3 gaining ground, which reportedly prompted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare a “code red” at the world’s most valuable startup.\nApart from this, Alphabet won a major reprieve in the Department of Justice antitrust case. District Judge Amit Mehta allowed it not only to retain Chrome and Android but also to continue its partnership with Apple (AAPL) that makes it the default choice on iPhones.\n\nAlphabet received another boost after Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) disclosed a multi-billion-dollar stake in the company in Q3. While it isn’t known whether the investment was made by Warren Buffett, who has now retired as the CEO, handing over the baton to Greg Abel, it was nonetheless a major vote of confidence for the search giant.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet Stock 2026 Forecast The bar is set quite high for Alphabet now, unlike last year when markets had somber expectations from the company. In contrast to 2025, Alphabet enters 2026 with a sense of optimism. It has proved its mettle by maintaining the search leadership while simultaneously impressing with the execution of its AI initiatives. The company has also dismissed fears over AI monetization, and during the Q3 2025 earnings call, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said that AI is helping Alphabet “understand and predict intent like never before, unlocking entirely new commercial pathways to provide valuable new consumer connections and helping us monetize even more efficiently.”\n\nAlphabet’s subscription business is also growing fast, and it had 300 million paying subscribers between YouTube and Google One at the end of September. TPU sales could potentially become the next big business for Alphabet as companies try to reduce reliance on Nvidia (NVDA). Even as the Jensen Huang-led company continues to lead that market, it likely will continue to do so for the near foreseeable future.\nMeanwhile, while Alphabet has often traded at a discount to the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) over the last couple of years, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of nearly 30x, it now commands a significant premium over the average index constituent.\nAs things stand today, sell-side analysts have a consensus target price of $327.81 on GOOGL, which is only about 4.5% higher than current levels. To be sure, the targets are bound to be revised as the year progresses, but for now, I am not too sold on the stock’s risk-reward given the rich valuations and the rising AI capex. This would hurt the company’s earnings and free cash flows in the short term.\nWhile I remain invested in Alphabet, I don’t find the current valuations enticing enough to trigger a fresh purchase. While Alphabet should still rise from these levels, I expect the returns to be much more muted than last year.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AAPL, GOOG, BRK.B, META, AMZN, NVDA.

To date, they have returned over $300 billion in profits to the government.\nExercise Warrants: The government holds warrants for a 79.9% stake in both companies.

      "Content": "Manus-Meta deal may draw Beijing scrutiny over tech exports controls, experts say\n\nSouth China Morning Post\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 1:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThe more than US$2 billion acquisition of agentic AI start-up Manus by US social media giant Meta Platforms could face scrutiny from Beijing over technology export controls, experts warn.\nThe sale of Manus, a Singapore-based but Chinese-founded AI agent developer, could raise compliance questions around Beijing's technology export regime, and expectations that the company can fully decouple from China may be \"oversimplified\", said Cui Fan, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics and chief expert at the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies.\n\nIn a commentary published on WeChat on Saturday, Cui said the core issue was \"whether there exists any technology whose export is prohibited or restricted under Chinese laws and regulations, but which has been transferred overseas without approval.\"\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nHe cited China's current Regulations on the Administration of Technology Import and Export, adding that regulators would need to assess \"when, in what manner, and which technologies were transferred abroad by Manus' onshore entities, including both natural persons and legal entities\".\n\nCui noted that there had been no confirmation that members of Manus' core team have relinquished Chinese nationality, nor any indication that, as individuals, they were no longer subject to Chinese jurisdiction. He added that Manus' mainland-registered parent, Butterfly Effect, remained under the control of the founding team, and that its early-stage research and development work took place in China.\nThe Meta logo is seen at Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, June 11, 2025. Photo: Reuters alt=The Meta logo is seen at Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, June 11, 2025. Photo: Reuters>\nThe deal has drawn intense industry attention for what appears to be a staggering return for the founders and early investors. It also comes against the backdrop of a widening US-China technology divide, marked by Washington's tighter scrutiny of outbound investments by US venture capital firms and individuals, as well as curbs on advanced technology exports.\n\nOn the Chinese side, long-standing restrictions on major US tech platforms have limited them from launching American AI models in China.\nIn April 2025, Manus - which had just completed its widely-watched product launch in March - raised US$75 million in a funding round led by Benchmark, a move that reportedly attracted closer attention from US regulators. Shortly after, the company - which had its roots in Beijing and Wuhan - relocated to Singapore, laying off some of its China-based workforce and shutting down its Chinese social media accounts. A previously announced partnership with Post owner Alibaba Group Holding on developing a Chinese version of Manus also came to nothing.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Singapore move was considered an effort to secure access to US capital, computing resources, large language models and international markets.\n\"Driven by US regulations restricting investment in China, Manus gradually disentangled itself from its corporate structure and business operations in China, leading to this mutual move towards Meta,\" Cui wrote, describing it as a \"special commercial deal forged under complex geopolitical conditions\".\n\nConcerns over potential intervention from Beijing have also been raised elsewhere. Writing on Substack, Paul Triolo, a partner at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, said AI agents were highly likely to be classified as \"important information technology products and services\" under Chinese rules, potentially bringing the deal within the scope of China's national security review of foreign investment activities.\n\"In theory, if they choose to do so, Chinese regulators could spin a national security narrative around Meta's acquisition,\" Triolo wrote. However, he added that \"as with TikTok, Beijing's primary objectives are to prevent Chinese companies from being subjected to forced divestiture or forced tech transfer: neither is at play here\".\n\nCui noted that Chinese law clearly stipulates legal liabilities for the unauthorised export of restricted technologies.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) , the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Ramsey said most of these people became wealthy by working hard, saving, investing, and improving their skills over time, and that it would be \"absurd\" to claim their money came from luck.\n\n\"It's the idea that a farmer who plants seed and gets a crop after watering it and doing all the weeding and making sure that the land is taken care of, versus the farmer who just stands back and looks at the dirt, is lucky when his harvest comes in,\" Ramsey said. \"It was just luck.

And Abel will undoubtedly be under the microscope, because Berkshire's next decade of returns will likely depend less on operational execution and more on how its cash gets deployed.

But the excess capital they throw off ultimately gets funneled back to Omaha, where it can be redeployed through acquisitions, share repurchases, or stock positions.\nThis capital allocation work from Berkshire's headquarters is what Buffett built his reputation on, and it will likely be what makes or breaks Abel's reputation going forward.\n\nWhile Abel hasn't spoken in detail about where the bulk of the responsibility for capital allocation will lie at Berkshire, it will be in his hands if Buffett gets his wish.\nAt Berkshire's 2024 annual meeting, Buffett said, \"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg. He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks.\"\nThe size of Berkshire's cash pile is what makes this transition so consequential. Berkshire boasts well over $350 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury bills. When the cash position is that large, a handful of decisions can drive shareholder outcomes.\nAbel may share some capital allocation responsibilities Berkshire Hathaway has long disclosed that Todd Combs and Ted Weschler managed portions of its public-stock portfolio, with Buffett managing the majority. But Berkshire announced in December that Combs would conclude his tenure at the company. This leaves investors with some questions, including whether Weschler will take over Combs' portion of the portfolio or if it will go to Abel. In addition, it's possible that Abel relies even more on Weschler than Buffett did, allocating an even larger portion of the portfolio to the investment lieutenant's management. After all, Weschler has an incredible track record when it comes to stock picking.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile it's possible that Weschler takes on even more responsibility at Berkshire, I suspect that Abel will follow Buffett's advice and become Berkshire's primary capital allocator, leaving a smaller portion to Weschler.\nBeyond his 2024 comments, Buffett recently reinforced his confidence in Abel in a recent CNBC interview, saying he'd rather have Abel handling his money than any of the top investment advisors or CEOs in the United States.\n\nComing from the Oracle of Omaha, that says a lot.\nBerkshire stock: What investors should watch next So where does that leave investors?\nHere's what I'd watch next: Berkshire's first truly large capital move under Abel. A modest equity trim or a bolt-on deal will not tell you much. But a decision that commits tens of billions of dollars will. When that first big move happens, investors may get an early glimpse of Abel's capital allocation approach.\n\nAdditionally, I'll be watching for any share repurchases. Since the second quarter of 2024, Berkshire has refrained from repurchasing its shares. If Berkshire resumes repurchases in the first quarter of 2025, it may suggest that Abel believes the stock is undervalued.\nBut investors shouldn't get their hopes up for any significant moves to occur immediately. The company was built around discipline and patience. As Buffett's hand-picked successor, Abel will likely honor those values. Abel, therefore, probably won't make a big move unless it's truly attractive -- and a great opportunity may not surface right away.\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

( CSE:BATX )( OTCQB:BATXF )( FSE:5YW0, WKN:A41RJF ) (\" Battery X Metals \" or the \" Company \") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces a meaningful advancement in the development of its next-generation, patent-pending lithium-ion battery rebalancing technology. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (\" Battery X Rebalancing Technologies\" ), the Company has completed an important preliminary step toward expanding platform compatibility with one of the most widely adopted electric vehicle platforms in the world.\nAs part of its ongoing research and development program, the Company has completed a high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) scan of a Tesla Model 3 battery pack (the \" Tesla Battery Pack \"), a vehicle platform associated with the top-selling electric vehicle brand in the United States. Tesla accounted for approximately 45% of U.S. EV sales in 2024.¹ The Tesla Battery Pack was obtained at no cost from an arm's-length automotive service-center collaboration partner and scanned using a portable 3D scanning system to support battery-interface analysis and adaptor development. The resulting scan captures precise geometric and structural data required to digitally model the battery interface and informs the design of custom connector and adaptor solutions for the Company's rebalancing platform.\n\nThis technical advancement underscores the Company's methodical adaptor compatibility development strategy, supported by an expanding library of real-world battery-pack data used to enable physical interfacing, diagnostics, and rebalancing workflows. The completed scan of the Tesla Model 3 battery pack provides the foundational digital reference required to begin adaptor and connector engineering work intended to allow the Rebalancing Machine to physically interface with this specific battery architecture.\n\nStory Continues\nFollowing completion of the scan, the Company plans to provide the digital dataset to its development partner, Beijing Pengneng Science & Technology Ltd., for further engineering work focused on adaptor and connector design. This step is expected to support continued development of the Company's second-generation rebalancing system and inform broader compatibility strategies across additional high-volume electric vehicle platforms over time. While no assurance can be given that compatibility will ultimately be achieved or commercialized, the Company believes this advancement represents a necessary and deliberate step in its long-term product development roadmap.\n\nSignificance of Tesla to the Electric Vehicle Revolution\nThe strategic relevance of this work is underscored by the scale and influence of Tesla within the global electric vehicle ecosystem. Tesla has played a central role in reshaping the automotive industry and accelerating EV adoption worldwide, and remains the largest electric vehicle brand in the United States. 1\nThe Tesla Model 3, in particular, represents one of the largest single EV populations globally, with cumulative sales estimated at approximately 2.63 million vehicles by the end of the third quarter of 2024. 2 As these vehicles continue to age, a growing proportion is expected to exit original battery warranty coverage over the coming years. By approximately 2032, a significant portion of the Tesla Model 3 fleet currently on the road is expected to be outside warranty, increasing exposure to battery degradation, reduced driving range, and costly replacement requirements. 2,3\n\nThis emerging lifecycle challenge highlights a growing market need for technologies capable of extending remaining useful battery life, restoring lost performance, and reducing total cost of ownership for EV owners. With millions of vehicles approaching or entering out-of-warranty status, demand for advanced battery diagnostics, rebalancing, and second-life solutions is expected to increase materially. 4 The Company is developing its patent-pending rebalancing platform with the objective of addressing this need by correcting cell-level imbalances that degrade battery performance over time, potentially extending the remaining useful life of existing battery packs.\nThe Company believes that advancing compatibility work with high-volume EV platforms such as the Tesla Model 3 represents a meaningful step toward positioning its patent-pending rebalancing technology within a growing addressable market. As the Company continues to refine its hardware, software, and interfacing capabilities, management remains focused on building a scalable platform designed to support the evolving needs of the global electric vehicle ecosystem.\n\nThe Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges\nIn 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023. 5 With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units, 6 a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years. 7,8\nBy 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage. 7,8 This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements. 9 As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.\n\nThe Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity\nBattery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.\nBattery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (\" NRC \"), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC - resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, representing a decrease of approximately 35%. Following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, the battery module's discharge capacity was restored to 70.94Ah, representing the recovery of approximately 99% of the capacity lost due to cell imbalance.\n\nThese advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.\nThe Results disclosed herein are based on preliminary trial conditions and may not be representative of all vehicle models or usage scenarios.

      "Content": "Crypto ‘wrench attacks’ surge as thieves use violence to steal digital assets\n\nRob Lenihan\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:58 PM PST 4 min read\n\nEarly one morning in November, a man posing as a delivery driver rang the buzzer at a home in San Francisco’s Mission District.\nHowever, this person had come with seriously bad intentions, police said, as he pulled a gun, tied up one of the residents with duct tape, and stole $11 million worth of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nLaw enforcement officials reportedly believe the robbery was a targeted hit by an organized crime group.\nThe attacker beat the victim while holding up a phone on loudspeaker as “foreign voices” on the line repeated personal information about him. The thief then poured liquid over the victim before emptying his crypto wallets over the course of around 90 minutes.\nTwo months earlier, on Sept. 25, federal officials said that two Texas brothers had been charged with kidnapping for allegedly holding a Minnesota family hostage and stealing $8 million in cryptocurrency.\nRaymond Christian Garcia and Isiah Angelo Garcia, wielding an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun, zip-tied their victims, officials said, as they demanded that large amounts of cryptocurrency be transferred into a cryptocurrency wallet.\nDuring the incident, Isiah Garcia allegedly drove one victim to a family cabin to retrieve a hard drive-style cryptocurrency wallet.\nWrench attacks are increasing, officials say The victim’s son managed to call 911, prompting such a massive law enforcement response that Mahtomedi Public Schools canceled its homecoming football game due to the ongoing activity near the campus.\n“A violent kidnapping that stole $8 million and silenced a homecoming game is not just a crime,” Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said in a statement. “It is a blow to the sense of safety of everyone in Minnesota. This is not normal.”\n\nMore news\nLongtime fund manager sends blunt message on P/E ratios\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nWhat the White House decision really means for Nvidia\nMichael Burry shares bold predictions for OpenAI, Palantir\nViolent cryptocurrency robberies may not be normal, but industry analysts say they are increasing.\nCryptocurrency ripoffs have been around almost as long crypto as itself, and they exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic as social media became a primary tool for promoters of fake investments and romance scams\nThese crimes tended to be online ripoffs and reports from late 2025 and early 2026 point to a significant, likely record-setting, surge in cryptocurrency scams and theft.\nPhysical attacks are increasing as well, and 2025 is on track to have twice as many such assaults as the previous year, the consulting firm WTW said in a report , with “multiple kidnap and ransom (K&R) incidents, which have targeted senior figures in the cryptocurrency industry across Asia, Europe and North America.”\n\nStory Continues\nThese crimes are called “wrench attacks,” a term that is said to have stemmed from a comedian who joked that “instead of hacking the encryption, just hit them with a $5 wrench until they give up the password.”\n“The increase in security by online crypto trading services may be a factor that’s led to the increase in the trend of malicious actors targeting individual wallet holders instead, employing violence and coercion,” WTW said.\n\nThe firm added that the appreciation in digital assets like Bitcoin and the ease and decentralized nature of transferring cryptocurrency come with a higher risk of physical attacks.\nSmall crypto holders also targeted “It’s becoming increasingly paramount to assess your exposure to physical extortion, coercion and limit public visibility of crypto wealth through personal security and wallet access controls,” the report said.\n\nAri Redbord, the global head of policy and government affairs at crypto analytics firm TRM Labs, said 2025 was a record year for wrench attacks—with roughly 60 reported physical assaults on crypto holders, according to the crypto news site The Block .\n\nRelated: Quantum computing making big leap, analysts say\n“The true number is likely significantly higher,” Redbord noted. “Many incidents are logged simply as robberies or burglaries, with the crypto element omitted, while others are never reported due to victim hesitation or uncertainty about how law enforcement will handle crypto-related crimes.”\nAnd it’s not just ultra-rich crypto holders who are being targeted. A Bloomberg Businessweek investigation found that victims now include children, teachers, a construction worker, and a fireman.\nA report by the risk management and security firm Solace Global said many of these wrench attacks are taking place in countries that are generally considered low-risk for kidnapping and have robust law enforcement capabilities, such as Western Europe, the US, and Canada.\n\n“This further illustrates the risks criminal organizations are willing to take to secure such valuable and easily movable digital assets,” the report said.\nThe firm said that wrench attacks and the use of violence to obtain crypto holdings illegally are highly likely to increase in the medium term.\nWrench attacks on smaller crypto holders will probably further increase with crypto adoption and the expansion of crypto physical infrastructure, such as crypto ATMs, in-person exchange offices, and payment terminals.\nIn fact, the FBI said fraudsters bilked Americans out of more than $333 million in 2025 with ruses perpetrated using bitcoin ATM machines, ABC News reported.\n“As law enforcement adapts and regulation grows, criminal groups operating in safer jurisdictions are likely to increase the outsourcing of violence to local street gangs or proxy groups,” Solace Group said.\n“With this likely comes an increased risk of violence, with proxy groups typically less professional, more unpredictable, and more prone to excessive force.”\nRelated: Fear, fatigue & finances: America's mood heading into 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 2, 2026, where it first appeared in the Economy section.

All information provided is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new wellness practice. This article contains affiliate links. If you purchase through these links, a commission may be earned at no additional cost to you. This article does not offer medical advice, clinical evaluations, or product comparisons intended to influence purchasing decisions.\nAs the wellness technology category enters 2026, Holy Hydrogen , a U.S.-based distributor of Japanese-manufactured hydrogen systems, reports sustained consumer interest in precision-engineered wellness devices following what the company describes as increased public awareness of molecular hydrogen research.\nThe Lourdes Hydrofix Premium Edition, Holy Hydrogen's flagship product , represents a category of home wellness devices designed to generate molecular hydrogen through electrolysis for both water enrichment and inhalation applications. According to the company, each unit is hand-assembled in Japan using dual-chamber electrolysis technology and proprietary membrane systems engineered to produce hydrogen without the use of chemical additives or plated metal components.\n\nThe timing coincides with what industry observers describe as a maturation phase for hydrogen wellness technology. Consumer options now span a wide range—from portable systems to countertop generators—each approaching hydrogen delivery through different engineering philosophies and price points.\nMolecular Hydrogen Research Context\nInterest in molecular hydrogen as a wellness element has grown alongside an expanding body of scientific literature. A simple search of medical research databases reveals over 2,000 publications exploring molecular hydrogen's properties, with ongoing clinical investigations examining potential applications across various health contexts.\nRecent peer-reviewed systematic reviews have explored hydrogen-rich water's possible effects on exercise capacity, oxidative stress markers, and general wellness indicators. These studies consistently emphasize that while preliminary findings show promise, larger-scale research with rigorous methodologies remains necessary. The scientific community continues investigating mechanisms through which molecular hydrogen may interact with cellular processes.\n\nStory Continues\nHoly Hydrogen makes no medical claims regarding its products. The company positions its technology within the broader landscape of wellness practices that emphasize cellular support, hydration optimization, and daily wellness routines.\nEngineering Approach and Quality Standards\nThe Lourdes Hydrofix Premium Edition operates through what Holy Hydrogen describes as a dual-chamber electrolysis process that separates hydrogen production from oxygen during the generation cycle. According to the company's technical documentation, this design aims to maintain hydrogen concentration stability in water while avoiding the introduction of chemical catalysts or corrosive compounds.\n\nThe system's MFPM (proprietary membrane) technology features a three-layer, fiber-reinforced structure designed to create what the company describes as \"ultra-fine hydrogen bubbles.\" According to Holy Hydrogen's materials , these nanobubbles remain dissolved in water for extended periods compared to standard bubbling methods, potentially improving bioavailability for users.\nThird-party testing documentation is available through the company's website . According to certificates from Japan Food Research Laboratories, water samples produced by the Lourdes Hydrofix Premium Edition under specified test conditions did not contain detectable levels of selected plasticizers, BPA, iron, or titanium. The device's pitcher components are constructed from certified 99.9% pure, non-plated titanium, according to materials testing documentation published by the company.\n\nThese certifications reflect what Holy Hydrogen describes as Japan's manufacturing quality protocols. The company emphasizes that each unit undergoes quality testing before shipment and is covered by a warranty addressing manufacturing defects.\nMarket Context and Consumer Considerations\nHoly Hydrogen operates exclusively through its official website, a distribution model the company states is designed to ensure product authenticity and warranty eligibility. The brand positions itself in what it describes as the premium segment of hydrogen wellness devices, with pricing that reflects Japanese manufacturing standards and hand-assembly processes.\nConsumer experiences with hydrogen wellness devices vary significantly based on several factors: product maintenance practices, water quality used in the system, consistency of use, and individual wellness baselines. Review aggregation across multiple platforms reveals patterns in customer feedback.\n\nSatisfied users frequently mention build quality, system reliability over extended periods, and the dual functionality of water and inhalation modes. Users who report challenges often cite learning curves associated with proper maintenance, expectations about outcome timelines, and international shipping logistics from Japan.\nAccording to Holy Hydrogen's published guidance, optimal device performance requires the use of distilled or purified water and adherence to regular cleaning cycles. The company states that mineral buildup from tap water can affect hydrogen output over time if maintenance protocols are not followed.\nWellness Practice Integration and January Timing\nThe company's announcement arrives as January 2026 marks what wellness industry analysts describe as a peak period for health optimization investments. Consumer research into longevity technology, cellular health devices, and biohacking tools typically increases in early January as individuals establish wellness routines for the year ahead.\n\nHoly Hydrogen's educational materials emphasize that hydrogen therapy should be approached as a sustained daily practice similar to other foundational wellness habits rather than an intervention producing immediate, dramatic results. According to user experiences shared through various channels, individuals who report perceived benefits typically describe gradual improvements in energy patterns, recovery timelines, or general vitality over weeks or months of consistent use.\nThis messaging approach addresses expectation management—a factor that significantly influences user satisfaction across the wellness technology category. Products marketed with realistic timelines and outcomes tend to generate more sustained positive feedback compared to those promising rapid transformations.\n\nProfessional Context and Clinical Exploration\nAccording to materials published by Holy Hydrogen, the Lourdes Hydrofix has been introduced in certain wellness-oriented practice environments in Japan. Some practitioners have shared observations about hydrogen therapy within supportive wellness frameworks. These applications occur in non-clinical, complementary wellness settings and do not represent medical evaluations, controlled research, or validated therapeutic outcomes.\nThe company clearly distinguishes between academic research on molecular hydrogen as a subject of scientific inquiry and consumer wellness devices designed for home use. While peer-reviewed studies explore hydrogen's fundamental properties at the molecular level, these investigations do not validate specific product claims or guarantee individual user experiences.\n\nDistribution Operations and Customer Experience\nHoly Hydrogen's business model emphasizes direct customer relationships and educational transparency. The company's website includes detailed technical documentation, safety certifications, and comprehensive disclaimer language addressing product limitations and regulatory positioning.\nWarranty coverage applies to manufacturing defects within specified periods, with return procedures coordinated through the company's customer support team. According to published policies, returned products must be in like-new condition with original packaging to qualify for refunds—a standard practice for precision wellness equipment.\nShipping timelines reflect the product's Japanese manufacturing origin.

By 2026, the category encompasses diverse product types, each addressing hydrogen delivery through different technical approaches and at various price points.\n\nFactors influencing consumer decisions in this category include manufacturing transparency, material quality documentation, hydrogen concentration stability, device longevity, and the presence of verifiable third-party testing. Products that provide clear operational guidance, realistic outcome expectations, and accessible customer support tend to build stronger user retention.\nCurrent research into molecular hydrogen spans multiple disciplines, with investigators examining potential interactions between hydrogen and various physiological systems. This ongoing scientific work does not validate commercial products but provides a foundation of knowledge that informs public interest in hydrogen as a wellness element. Researchers consistently emphasize that molecular hydrogen's mechanisms remain under investigation and that consumer applications should be understood as supportive wellness practices rather than medical interventions.\n\nConsumer Education and Decision-Making\nFor individuals evaluating hydrogen wellness technology, Holy Hydrogen recommends considering several factors beyond initial product cost: long-term reliability expectations, maintenance requirements, the importance of third-party testing documentation, and realistic timeline expectations for any perceived changes in wellness markers.\nThe company's materials acknowledge that hydrogen therapy may not produce noticeable effects for all users and that individual responses vary based on numerous factors including baseline health status, lifestyle practices, consistency of use, and physiological variability. This transparent approach to outcome variability reflects the company's positioning as an educational resource rather than a promotional entity.\n\nSource Information and Contact Details\nProduct specifications, current availability, and detailed technical documentation are maintained on the official Holy Hydrogen website .

      "Content": "Cloud Spending and AI Workloads Push Western Digital (WDC) Higher\n\nVardah Gill\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:44 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: WDC\n\nWestern Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: WDC ) is included among the 20 Best Performing Dividend Stocks in 2025 .\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\nAccording to a report by CNBC, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring sees several near-term catalysts lining up for Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC). He pointed to upcoming events such as the company’s Innovation Bazaar, Investor Day, and its next earnings release early next year as potential drivers for the stock. From Woodring’s perspective, the hard disk drive market remains one of the strongest areas within the tech hardware space he covers. Customer demand has continued to improve, not weaken, which stands out in a sector that often moves in cycles. That backdrop led Morgan Stanley to raise its price target on Western Digital to $228 from $188, reflecting the company’s strong exposure to cloud capital spending. Woodring also reiterated that Western Digital remains the firm’s top pick, citing a rare mix of healthy end markets, solid pricing power, and multiple near-term catalysts. The stock’s performance backs up that view. Shares have surged more than 280% in 2025, effectively quadrupling over the year.\n\nWhile Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) does produce solid-state drives that rely on chips to store data, the company is best known for its traditional hard disk drives. These products use spinning disks and are designed to store massive amounts of data, often measured in terabytes, making them well-suited for large-scale data center use.\nThat focus is showing up in the numbers. In the most recent quarter, revenue climbed 27% to $2.82 billion. Management has been clear about where margins can improve. Selling higher-capacity storage into data centers tends to be more profitable, especially as AI-focused customers demand larger and more expensive drives to handle growing workloads.\nLooking ahead, revenue is expected to rise about 23% in fiscal 2026. Growth is projected to slow to around 13% in 2027, though that still reflects expansion rather than contraction. The company’s structure also changed earlier this year. In February, Western Digital spun off its flash memory business into Sandisk. The standalone company now carries a market value of roughly $35 billion, which is more than half of Western Digital’s own valuation.\nWestern Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) develops and supplies data storage devices and solutions. Its hard disk drive products serve a wide range of customers, from individual users and small offices to large enterprises and public cloud providers.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of WDC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

On Wednesday, John Freeman , Co-Founder and Senior Analyst at Ravenswood Partners, highlighted the potential impact of Microsoft’s Azure on Google’s AI business, particularly in the context of the upcoming ChatGPT 6 and the Gemini 3. Johnson pointed out that Google’s traditional business model, which relies on providing links instead of giving direct answers, has been impacted by ChatGPT, and this shift could potentially cut into Google’s revenues.\n“Anything on the margin that clips it, I think would really…hurt the stock,” he stated.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nFreeman expressed his preference for Microsoft over Google as a stock, citing Microsoft’s Azure as the leading AI cloud provider and its potential for future growth. He added that Microsoft’s Azure is not only the leading AI cloud provider but also has a strong influence on the developer community, which further strengthens its position in the AI market.\n\n“And you don’t have the downside risk of generative AI disruption. I mean, you’ve got Microsoft 365 and Windows. Those are not likely to be disrupted by AI anytime soon,” he added.\nCorey Johnson , chief market strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research , echoed Freeman’s opinion on Google and stated that what Google is doing with AI erodes the core offerings of its business of generating revenue through clicks.\n“Their business is at inherent risk because of the cannibalization of AI,” he stated.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAnalysts Divided Over Google’s Prospects The analysts’ observations align with recent developments in the AI space. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says Wall Street is underestimating Microsoft, arguing the company is getting \"no respect\" despite being positioned for significant AI-driven growth in 2026, with its cloud business seen as a key winner in strategic AI deployments.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is ramping up its cloud and AI expansion with billions in global infrastructure investments, including its largest-ever commitment in Canada. The company plans to invest $19 billion CAD ($13.85 billion) between 2023 and 2027 to build new digital and AI infrastructure, boost data center capacity by late 2026, and advance digital sovereignty and AI skills across the country.\n\nStory Continues\nThat being said, some analysts also feel that Wall Street has already moved away from seeing AI as a threat to Google’s search business and considers it as a \"giant opportunity.\" Landon Swan , co-founder of LikeFolio, says that he is highly optimistic about the company's ability to leverage the technology.\n\nRead Next:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

      "Content": "Why Meta's +$2B AI Startup Acquisition Could Be a Huge Win\n\nLeo Miller, MarketBeat\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 1:32 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Shares of Meta Platforms rose after the firm announced its purchase of artificial intelligence startup Manus.\nManus is growing exponentially, generating $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than one year.\nThe solutions that Meta and Manus provide complement each other, giving the marriage a solid chance to succeed.\nInterested in Meta Platforms, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nConcerns about out-of-control artificial intelligence (AI) spending have cast a shadow of doubt over Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) recently. Despite being up as much as 35% in 2025, the stock ended the year with a total return of just 13%. This is largely due to Meta’s latest earnings report on Oct. 29. The Magnificent Seven company forecasted higher-than-expected spending in 2026, causing a huge sell-off. From then to the end of the year, the stock is down 12%.\nMeta is looking to cut spending in some areas, such as the Metaverse. However, the company’s latest acquisition shows that AI investment remains top of mind. Below, we’ll break down the firm’s acquisition of AI startup Manus and detail its potential implications for the stock. All data is as of the Dec. 31 close unless otherwise indicated.\n\n→ D-Wave vs. IonQ vs. IBM vs. Google: Which Quantum Bets Will Win 2026?\nMeta Buys AI Startup Manus for +$2 Billion, Shares Rise After the market close on Dec. 29, Meta announced its acquisition of Manus. Manus develops general-purpose AI agents, which Meta says can “independently execute complex tasks like market research, coding, and data analysis.\" The exact financials of the deal are unknown at this point. However, several outlets have reported the acquisition price at “over $2 billion.\"\n\nOn Dec. 30, Meta shares rose 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and the tech sector declined slightly. This suggests that markets had a mildly positive view of the deal. This is interesting, considering that Meta’s spending forecasts are the main overhang on the stock. Meta’s price action indicates that markets are not treating all of the company’s AI spending equally.\n→ Hi Ho Silver Away! Silver Breaks $80 as Poor Man's Gold Explodes\nContributing to the market’s positive reaction is Manus’s impressive growth. On Dec. 17, Manus said it had achieved $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) just eight months after launching. Manus claims that it went from $0 to $100M in ARR faster than any startup in the world.\nManus’s AI agent has created more than 80 million virtual computers, indicating significant real-world deployment. Virtual computers are isolated environments where AI agents can operate and execute tasks independently. The creation of over 80 million virtual computers shows that Manus’s agent is executing millions of tasks for customers. Its technology isn’t just theoretically useful; it's making an impact on businesses today. Combining this proof of concept with Meta’s scale could prove to be a winning recipe.\n\nStory Continues\n→ The 3 Stocks That Crushed the S&P 500 in 2025\nManus Can Support Meta’s Business-Centric Model Manus’s technology clearly aligns with Meta’s value creation strategy. The primary reason Meta has grown into a company with a market capitalization of over $1.6 trillion is that it helps other businesses succeed. By advertising within the company’s massive social media network, businesses grow their brand and attract more customers. Meta continually improves its recommendation algorithms using AI, helping advertising campaigns perform even better, delivering more value to marketers. While consumers associate Meta with Facebook posts and Instagram feeds, businesses see Meta as a partner that helps them grow and operate efficiently.\n\nThis is the same value that customers see in Manus, but in a different context. While Meta’s tools help automate advertising campaigns, Manus’s tools help them automate a wider range of business tasks, like research, coding, and analysis. In buying Manus, Meta is likely looking to position itself as more of a \"one-stop shop” for business solutions.\nProviding a streamlined source for business solutions makes sense considering Meta’s customer base. Meta works with a lot of small to medium-sized businesses. In many cases, these businesses may have limited ability to stay up to date on the latest AI tools. By combining its tools with Manus’s, Meta could offer a convenient package to customers. This is something that many smaller companies would likely appreciate.\n\nAt first glance, a $2 billion price tag is somewhat hefty for a business generating $100 million in ARR. However, through Meta’s widespread data center infrastructure and massive customer base, it should be able to scale Manus in a huge way. This makes the price Meta paid feel completely reasonable.\nMeta and Manus: An AI Marriage With Real Potential While Meta’s acquisition of Manus makes sense, the company will likely need to improve its AI models to keep Manus’s capabilities up to par. Nonetheless, the potential upside of the deal is significant. If Meta can deliver a new suite of value-creating AI tools to its customers, there could be meaningful benefits to its revenue and earnings growth over time.\nThe article \" Why Meta's +$2B AI Startup Acquisition Could Be a Huge Win \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "4 Under-the-Radar AI Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nBenzinga Research Team\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 1:31 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nFor investors bearish on artificial intelligence, watching the market action in 2025 had to feel like watching a zombie apocalypse movie. There were so many moments this year when it seemed the AI bull market was cooked, only to rise again like the undead and move forward with its insatiable thirst for more capital.\n\nWith the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both closing in on another 20% annual gain, you might think every rock in the AI landscape has been turned over, and there are no diamonds left to mine.\nBut 2025 also showed us that AI is more than just hyperscalers and semiconductors; there's a whole ecosystem of companies needed to keep data centers humming along.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nToday we'll look at four stocks that are still flying under the radar in the AI industry.\nEach company chosen here has a market cap under $5 billion and at least 30% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth over the last three years, with growing profit margins. These stocks were all big winners in 2025, so they might not stay under the radar for long if the AI rally continues.\n\nInnodata Inc. Innodata (NASDAQ: INOD ) made headlines earlier this year when it posted a DiMaggio-esque streak of 19 gains in 20 trading sessions. But like META before it, the impressive streak was followed by a swift and sharp decline. The stock is still beating the S&P 500 year-to-date (YTD), but it's now down over 30% in the last three months. However, both the fundamental and technical data point to a prosperous 2026. The company posted record revenue of over $62 million in Q3 2025, its fifth consecutive top- and bottom-line earnings beat. The $62 million represented a 20% YOY growth from Q3 2024, and management confirmed the full-year 2025 expectation of 45% YOY growth from 2024. Margins have also grown to a comfortable 26%, which should unlock even more EPS growth moving forward.\nINOD shares slumped following their impressive winning streak, but the stock still retained a more than 30% YTD gain as 2025 draws to an end. And despite the recent slump, the technical picture is beginning to show improvement. The stock has once again found support along the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), an area where buyers have repeatedly flooded in this year. With the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showing signs of turning bullish and Benzinga Edge Scores of 96.36 for Growth and 98.53 for Quality, INOD shares could be an even bigger winner in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nTrending: Have $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nEvolv Technologies Inc. Evolv Technologies (NASDAQ: EVLV ) is a tiny $1.2 billion market-cap holding company developing AI security screening services for large-crowd live events. The company's software uses AI to create a touchless security screening process that identifies weapons from everyday items like phones or water bottles. The company isn't yet profitable, but it still recorded more than $100 million in sales last year, and continues to eke toward profitability with each successive earnings beat. The company pulled in a record $42.85 million in revenue in Q3 2025, marking 57% YOY growth, and management raised full-year 2025 revenue guidance to the upper end of $145 million. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is also a massive part of the business model, and management expects ARR to grow more than 20% YOY in 2026.\nThe EVLV chart also looks promising, with the stock running into support at the 200-day SMA as a bullish MACD crossover occurs. The 50-day SMA is the next level to watch here; if bullish price momentum can sustain a break above it, the first quarter of 2026 should be tremendously positive for EVLV investors.\n\nAeva Technologies Inc. Aeva Technologies (NASDAQ: AEVA ) is a tiny $780 million small-cap company designing systems for one of the most crucial innovations in autonomous vehicle technology. The company's primary product is a 4D LiDAR suite with hardware and software applications. LiDAR is the motion-sensing technology powering Waymo's autonomous vehicles, offering superior performance to the traditional cameras used in Tesla's Robotaxis. Aeva experienced tremendous revenue growth in 2024 and 2025, with quarterly sales rising from $800,000 in Q4 2023 to $5.5 million in Q2 2025. Despite revenue dipping to $3.5 million in Q3 2025, the company still posted its eighth consecutive EPS and revenue beat, and recently inked a deal to become the exclusive LiDAR provider to a major European OEM.\nDespite revenue growth and industry tailwinds, AEVA shares have struggled in the second half of 2025, though this is partially due to an unsustainable parabolic rally that saw shares leap from $3 to $37 in just four months. The stock is back under $13 per share, but it now trades at a more reasonable level given that the company still hasn't turned a profit. On the daily chart, the share price is hovering around support at the 200-day SMA, but a bullish MACD crossover is giving investors hope for another rally in 2026.\n\nSee Also: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nSoundhound AI Inc. Soundhound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN ) may not be flying under the radar as much as it was in 2025, but the stock is approaching a key level that could present a great buying opportunity for new investors. Soundhound previously provided Voice AI solutions primarily to the automotive industry, but the company has branched out into other sectors over the last few years, including restaurants, healthcare, and banking. Revenue growth was strong in 2023 and 2024, but absolutely soared in 2025, growing more than 120% YOY. The company's losses also continued to narrow thanks to more substantial margins, and profitability in 2026 is now within reach.\nDespite the excitement surrounding the company, Q4 has been rough for SOUN shareholders. The stock declined rapidly after the RSI triggered an Overbought signal in October and is now down more than 35% over the last three months. However, technical signals are pointing to the bottom potentially being in. The momentum of the stock's descent has slowed now that the RSI sits right at the Oversold threshold, and the MACD is actually showing some buying momentum beginning to return. Small, growth-oriented stocks like SOUN often go through violent whipsawing streaks, and the stock could be poised for a move to the upside.\n\nRead Next: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "This Under-the-Radar AI Company Could Be the Best Stock You Buy in 2026.\n\nPathikrit Bose\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 1:03 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PWR\n\nThe ancillary trade, or the “picks and shovels” trade, as many refer to it, has been a lucrative way to build wealth over the years. Here, one is not getting on the bandwagon of an exciting or transformative space. Rather, the bet is on the engine and the nuts and bolts powering this bandwagon. Whether it was the “Gold Rush” of the mid-19th century or the AI revolution now, the “picks and shovels” trade has been a rewarding bet for investors.\n\nHowever, the choice of the right picks and shovels is necessary, with thoughtful discernment required to identify the right stocks in this trade. To that end, this Texas-based infrastructure services provider involved in the buildout of AI can be an option that can be looked into.\nMore News from Barchart Commodity Roundup- December’s Top Performers and Underperformers\nNat-Gas Prices Fall on Above-Normal US Weather Forecasts\nCrude Prices Pressured by Concerns About a Global Oil Glut\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nAbout Quanta Services Founded in 1997, Quanta Services (PWR) is a leading U.S. infrastructure services provider focused on complex energy, utility, communications, pipeline, and renewable projects. It is widely regarded as one of the largest specialty contractors in North America. The company is a specialty contracting services firm offering design, engineering, installation, maintenance, and repair services across multiple infrastructure verticals.\n\nValued at a market cap of $63 billion, PWR stock increased by 33.8% in 2025, outperforming the S&P 500's ($SPX) rise of 16.7% in the same period.\nHowever, amid a number of known and proven ways to play the AI infrastructure trade already available, how does Quanta stand out? Let's analyze.\nDecent Financials In terms of financials, nothing really screams out for Quanta. And that is mostly a good thing, with debt kept under control, which is not always the case for infrastructure companies. Over the last 10 years, Quanta has grown its revenue and earnings at CAGRs of 13.45% and 17.97%, respectively, which is, again, nothing extraordinary but steady growth.\n\nFurthermore, the company's quarterly results have been characterized by year-over-year (YoY) growth, as well as estimates beating in the past few years. The latest Q3 2025 did not deviate from the familiar path either.\nQ3 2025 saw Quanta recording revenues of $7.6 billion, up 17% from the previous year. The core electric segment, making up 81% of the total revenues, came in at $6.2 billion. This denoted an annual growth rate of 18.5%. The Underground and Infrastructure segment comprised the rest and reported sales of $1.46 billion, which marked a YoY growth of 15.9%.\n\nStory Continues\nEarnings for the quarter were $3.33 per share. Not only was this up by 22.4% from the previous year, but it also came in higher than the consensus estimate of an EPS of $3.25. Notably, this also marked the ninth consecutive quarter of earnings beat from the company.\nRemaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, a key indicator of revenue visibility, also showed strong growth of 34.5% from the previous year.\n\nHowever, net cash flow from operating activities witnessed an annual decline of 23.8% to $563.5 million. Yet, the company closed the quarter with a cash balance of $610.4 million, which was above its short-term debt levels of $204.9 million.\nOverall, for 2025, Quanta expects revenue to be between $27.8 billion and $28.2 billion and earnings to be in the range of $6.53 and $7.02 per share, the midpoint of which would imply yearly growth rates of 18.3% and 12.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, analysts are expecting Quanta to report revenue and earnings growth rates ahead of the sector median at 14.84% and 20.33% versus 5.07% and 9.68%, respectively.\nQuanta's Strategic Drivers With data center power requirements set to climb steeply in the years ahead, Quanta Services finds itself in a prime spot to reap the rewards. Its ongoing collaboration with American Electric Power (AEP) could turn out to be a standout factor. AEP is already working hand in hand with top-tier hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to fuel their data center expansions. Quanta has earned a spot as a primary contractor in AEP's $72 billion capital spending initiative, which targets upgrades to transmission networks and power delivery. Quanta's piece of the puzzle involves erecting 765 kV lines and similar high-voltage infrastructure to make sure AEP can keep up with customer loads. Arrangements like this stretch across multiple years and noticeably widen Quanta's playing field. Getting tapped for these roles also points to the company's chops, since it can tackle about 60% of what a standard data center job entails, not to mention other high-stakes builds.\n\nAdditionally, acquiring Dynamic Systems and Cupertino Electric shows Quanta's clear drive to get stronger in the data center game. Folding those teams into its existing electric-power muscle rounds out a fuller toolkit for all sorts of infrastructure work.\nHowever, Quanta's real secret weapon is the size of its skilled labor force. The company has pulled together more than 200 subsidiaries since its foundation, creating the biggest group of craft workers anywhere in North America. That lets it have an ever-ready stream of manpower, matching the breakneck speed hyperscalers run at, a tough barrier for others to match on big, hands-on projects.\nThe renewables side keeps building steam too. Last year, Quanta came in 30% ahead on its CO₂ cuts by commissioning over 12 GW of new capacity. Now the sights are set on topping 100 GW by 2035, layering in another solid revenue stream.\n\nPut it all together, and Quanta's tight connections in utilities, clean energy, and construction line it up nicely for lasting trends: overhauling the grid, adding more green power, and the data center rush. Those recent buys only sharpen the edge, setting the stage for reliable sales and profit climbs.\nAnalyst Opinion of PWR Stock Considering this, analysts have deemed the PWR stock a “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target price of $478.64. This indicates an upside potential of about 13.4% from current levels. Out of 29 analysts covering the stock, 18 have a “Strong Buy” rating, and 11 have a “Hold” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Meta Platforms vs. Pinterest: Which Social Media Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 12:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PINS\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points Picture-focused platform Pinterest has transformed itself into a more shoppable site.\nMeta is using AI to keep users on its site longer and help advertisers better target users.\nBoth stocks are attractively valued, but one seems a better opportunity in the year ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nSocial media stocks Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) both experienced volatility in 2025, marked by strong sell-offs and rallies throughout the year. But it was Meta that outperformed, turning in an over 10% gain, while Pinterest fell more than 10% as of this writing.\nBut a new year calls for a fresh look. So let's see which stock is set to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Pinterest Despite the stock's underperformance in 2025, Pinterest turned in robust results, growing its revenue by 16% through the first nine months of the year. Third-quarter results were strong, with revenue increasing by 17%, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA) climbed by 24%, and free cash flow jumped by 30%.\n\nThe company's growth has been led by international markets where it continues to nicely increase its user base and expand ARPU (average revenue per user). Last quarter, European monthly active users (MAUs) rose 8%, while European ARPU soared 31% to $1.31. Meanwhile, the rest of world MAUs climbed 16%, and ARPU soared 44% to $0.21.\nAt the same time, Pinterest has embraced artificial intelligence (AI) to transform its site from an online vision board to an AI-powered discovery and shoppable platform. It has developed a multimodal AI model to improve its recommendation engine and power visual search capabilities while also adding AI-powered features like an AI assistant that can go out and buy recommended products. It even has AI features that can act as a virtual stylist and even allow you to try on clothes virtually.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is also using AI on the back end to help advertisers through its Performance+ offering. Its solutions can help advertisers create better campaigns, such as taking a photo of a product and using AI to turn it into a lifestyle image with the product in the picture. One of the most powerful features of Performance+ is its dynamic ROAS (return on ad spending) bidding, which can help advertisers find customers about to make a major purchase and bid accordingly.\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just above 13 times 2026 analyst estimates compared to 22 times for Meta, the stock is also much cheaper.\n\nStory Continues\nThe case for Meta Platforms While Meta's stock had an up-and-down 2025, the company was hitting on all cylinders. Its revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, going from 16% in Q1 to 26% last quarter.\nLike Pinterest, the company's growth is being powered by AI. First, Meta has incorporated AI into its recommendation engine to feed users content they are more interested in. This has led to users spending more time on its platform, and it has brought more new users to its social media sites as well. More time on its apps, meanwhile, creates more space to show ads. At the same time, it has incorporated AI within its ad suite. It can help advertisers create higher-quality ads using generative AI while also better targeting users.\n\nThis helped drive Meta's growth last quarter. Its number of daily active users increased by 8% while ad impressions climbed 14%. Meanwhile, better-performing ad campaigns helped lead to a 10% increase in pricing. Heading into 2026, the company also has a big opportunity with both WhatsApp and Threads. It is just starting to gradually introduce ads to these platforms, which should be a solid long-term growth driver.\nOne of the biggest investor complaints with Meta is how much it is spending on side projects related to both the metaverse and AI. However, the company is reportedly set to lower its metaverse spending by 30% next year, which should boost profits.\nThe verdict I think both Meta and Pinterest are set up to perform well in 2026. Both companies are nicely benefiting from AI, and if the economy and advertising spend hold up, they should both continue to see strong revenue growth.\nHowever, I think Pinterest will be the stock to outperform in 2026. The shares are just way too cheap given the company's growth, and it has not been credited with the advancements to its platforms that it's made and the strides it's seeing in increasing ARPU in international markets.\n\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "5 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 12:05 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMETA\n\nCRM\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are benefiting from the AI infrastructure boom.\nMeta and Pinterest are social media stocks that are seeing their revenue driven by AI.\nSalesforce has a big AI agent opportunity, helped by its acquisition of Informatica.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTechnology stocks have been leading the market higher the past few years, but that doesn't mean there still aren't good values out there. Let's look at five cheap tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nNvidia While Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock isn't often associated with being cheap, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 25 times next year's analyst estimates. For a company that just grew its revenue by 62% last quarter and continues to see insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) , that's a bargain.\n\nSpending on artificial intelligence (AI) just continues to climb, and Nvidia remains in the best position to capture it. It has about a 90% market share in the GPU market, and its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code has been written, gives it a wide moat. And the company has shown it is ready to go on the offensive following a few recent acquisitions and partnerships.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing With a forward P/E of less than 24, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is another top tech bargain. The company saw its revenue soar 41% last quarter, and it is projecting that demand for AI chips will continue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual rate over the next few years.\nAs the only company that can manufacture advanced chips at scale with few defects, TSMC is in a prime position to benefit from the strong continued demand for GPUs and other AI chips. The company is working closely with chip designers on their semiconductor road maps to expand capacity to meet the increasing demand. And it has strong pricing power that will continue to drive revenue growth as well.\n\nMeta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the cheapest of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, trading at a forward P/E of just 22. However, the company has been a strong grower, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\nMeta's growth is being driven by AI, which it is using to both attract new users and keep people on its sites longer by feeding them more of the content they are interested in. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better ad campaigns and improve targeting.\nLast quarter, this led to a 14% jump in ad impressions and a 10% rise in ad prices. The company has just started gradually introducing ads to its WhatsApp messaging platform and its 3 billion users, as well as on its newest platform, Threads. This should help drive growth in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nSalesforce With a forward P/E of just above 20, shares of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) are inexpensive for a solidly growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) company with recurring revenue and high gross margins. Meanwhile, the company has the potential to become an AI winner.\nIts acquisition of Informatica, whose platform gathers data from a variety of sources and creates a single record, helps position it as a central source for a company's data from which AI agents can then act. This is an important piece of the puzzle with AI agents, which should help its solution continue to gain traction.\n\nLast quarter, annual recurring revenue for its AI agent platform surged 330% to $540 million. And this is really just the beginning of what could become an enormous opportunity.\nPinterest With a forward P/E just above 13, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is not only cheap, but its stock is also in the bargain bin. Last quarter, its revenue climbed 17%, while it grew its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization by 24%.\nThe company has been seeing strong growth in users and average revenue per user in international markets, while it has transformed its site into an AI-powered shoppable discovery platform. Its Performance Plus ad suite is helping advertisers create better campaigns and get better returns on their spending.\n\nUsers are increasingly drawn to Pinterest's platform to shop by the AI features it has introduced, such as visual search and virtual clothes try-ons. Its enhancements on both the front and back ends should continue to drive growth.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The regulation requires large platforms to mitigate the risk of illegal content spreading, the country said in a statement.\nRepresentatives for xAI ( XAAI.PVT ), the company that develops Grok and runs X, didn’t respond to requests for comment. The chatbot Grok generated a post on X in response to users’ questions on Friday that it had identified “lapses in safeguards” that were being “urgently” fixed.

      "Content": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Just Went All in on AI, Buying Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet. Could AI Stocks Still Deliver Big Returns in 2026?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Druckenmiller opened positions in these three AI leaders in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe billionaire has invested in AI stocks throughout this AI boom.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWhen investing, it's often a great idea to consider the moves of billionaire fund managers. They've demonstrated their knowledge of the stock market over the years, so by following their lead on certain occasions, you might score an investing win too. This doesn't mean you should always copy their moves, though. They might have a tolerance for risk that differs from yours or a shorter or longer investment horizon, for example.\n\nAnd it's important to remember that even these experts often disagree -- while one billionaire may pile into a particular stock, another billionaire may sell or avoid it. So it's key to pay attention to their moves, but then consider your own strategy and budget before taking action.\nToday, I'm taking a look at the recent moves of Stanley Druckenmiller, who oversees $4 billion in 13F securities as head of the Duquesne Family Office. Managers of more than $100 million must declare the buying or selling of these securities to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis -- and this is great for us because it allows us a glimpse into the investment moves of these experts.\nLet's check out Druckenmiller's latest moves and consider whether AI stocks still may deliver big returns in 2026.\n30 years of investment success So, first, it's important to consider Druckenmiller's background. The billionaire operated Duquesne Capital Management for 30 years, and during that time, he didn't have any money-losing years -- and he delivered an annual average return of 30%. Druckenmiller closed the fund about 15 years ago, but he continues to manage money at the helm of his family office .\n\nDruckenmiller has been an investor in AI stocks in recent years, but he shocked the market when he exited top-performing players Nvidia in late 2024 and Palantir Technologies in early 2025. And only one AI stock -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- is among the top five positions in his portfolio. The stock has a 5.2% weight in the portfolio for the No. 4 spot.\nStill, in the third quarter of last year, Druckenmiller made three moves that could be seen as a renewed shift into top AI players. Here they are in detail:\nDruckenmiller opened a position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , buying 437,070 shares. The stock now makes up 2.3% of his portfolio.\nHe opened a position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , buying 76,100 shares. The stock makes up 1.3% of Druckenmiller's holdings.\nThe billionaire opened a position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . He bought 102,200 shares, and the stock makes up 0.6% of his portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nAI in 2026 These stocks may not be Druckenmiller's biggest positions, but it's clear that he's confident about the future of AI. Now the question is: Could AI stocks still deliver big returns in 2026?\nIt's true that AI players have soared in recent years, and the valuations of many also have climbed. But certain players, such as Druckenmiller's purchases, remain reasonably priced considering what I'm about to mention right now.\nAMZN PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nWe're still in the early stages of the AI growth story. While training of AI models has been a big thing in recent times, we have yet to actually apply these models to real-life situations in a major way. This will involve inferencing, or the powering of the models through their \"thinking\" processes so that they can serve their purposes. We should see growth here throughout industries -- and down the road, robotics, telecom, and many other areas should keep the AI growth engine running.\n\nJensen Huang's prediction And even in the next few years, we may see a huge wave of growth. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang predicts AI infrastructure spending may reach as much as $4 trillion.\nTrends tech companies have seen so far support these growth forecasts, with demand for AI products and services soaring in recent quarters.\n\nOf course, stocks may not continue to climb without any interruption -- and it's impossible to predict when temporary pauses may occur. But, considering these points I've mentioned, AI stocks could continue to deliver big returns in 2026, and even if they don't, they're well-positioned to do so over the long term. That's why, for growth investors, it's a great idea to follow billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's moves and pick up a few reasonably priced AI stocks as we head into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "CES 2026: What to expect from the tech industry’s biggest show of the year\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 6:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nQCOM\n\nMETA\n\nWelcome to 2026. Now rinse out that champagne glass and pop some Advil because the tech industry’s biggest show of the year, CES, kicks off on Jan. 6 under the bright lights of Las Vegas.\nCompanies big and small will take over the famed Strip and Las Vegas Convention Center, debuting their latest and greatest offerings, and a good helping of fly-by-night products that’ll never see the light of day.\n\nWhile the show officially begins on Jan. 6, the festivities start a few days earlier with events like CES Unveiled and press conferences featuring Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang and AMD ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su. And that means you can expect artificial intelligence to be front and center at the trade show.\nThat will include everything from AI-focused PCs to new chips. But robots are looking like they’ll steal the spotlight in 2026.\n“​Every year CES has a theme. And sometimes you don't know what it is until you get to the show, and everybody's talking about it” explained Kinsey Fabrizio, president of the Consumer Technology Association trade organization, which runs CES.\n“But we can tell you right now, robotics is going to be talked about … big time at CES.”\n\nYahoo Finance will be live and in person in Vegas bringing you all of the latest news and announcements. Here’s what we’re anticipating at CES 2026.\nWhat to expect at CES CES has become a kind of battleground for chipmakers and designers to show off their wares to the world right alongside their biggest rivals.\nLast year, Nvidia was the talk of Las Vegas when Huang held a keynote in front of a massive audience at the Michelob Ultra Arena, debuting the company's newest lineup of gaming chips, a desktop-sized AI rig, and a variety of AI software services and platforms.\nThis year, you can expect even more from the company that closed out 2025 with a $4.5 trillion market cap. Huang, who is scheduled to take the stage at 1:00 p.m. PT on Jan. 5 will likely unveil new gaming offerings, as well as a host of AI apps and capabilities.\nAMD’s Su will then host her own keynote a few hours later at 6:30 p.m. PT, giving that company’s rebuttal to Nvidia’s announcements and providing updates on its own gaming and AI products.\n\nJim Johnson, Senior vice president and GM of Intel's ( INTC ) Client Computing Group, which covers sales of the company’s chips for consumer and enterprise PCs, will also hold a keynote at CES 2026 where he’s expected to provide updates on Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, chips.\nThe processors, which Intel initially revealed in October, are the first to use the company’s highly anticipated 18A chip technology, and are a key part of its broader turnaround effort.\n\nStory Continues\nQualcomm ( QCOM ) will also be on hand at CES, with CEO Cristiano Amon set to participate in a fireside chat with Fortune’s Andrew Nusca. Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon X-series processors for Windows PCs during CES 2025 and will likely build on that momentum at this year’s event.\nEach of the chipmakers will likely provide insights into their plans to power physical AI systems, a technical term for robots, during the show.\nExpect to see humanoid robots on display, as well as a number of robotic arms, AI-powered drones, and self-driving cars scattered across Las Vegas this year, as the industry looks to rapidly advance the technology.\nSpeaking of cars, CES has become a major showcase for the auto industry’s tech ambitions, and this year will be no different. The show will likely include flying car concepts, a mainstay in recent years, as well as a variety of ways car companies are looking to capitalize on the AI trend by incorporating the technology into their vehicles’ dashboards.\n\nAI-powered wearables and fitness trackers could also make their debut at CES 2026. Those can come in the form of smart rings, glasses, or pins. The smart glasses space in particular has gained plenty of attention with the launch of Meta’s ( META ) Ray-Ban Display glasses in September, and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Samsung planning their own smart glasses.\nApple ( AAPL ) is also reportedly looking to get into the smart glasses game, though the company eschews making an appearance at CES in favor of hosting its own highly polished events at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., throughout the year.\nNaturally, there are sure to be some outlandish products at CES 2026. Over the years, we’ve seen everything from smart toilets to forks designed to help you eat healthier foods.\nIt’s sure to be an interesting show, and Yahoo Finance will bring you all of the biggest announcements as they happen.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Billionaire Peter Thiel Sold Nvidia and Tesla to Buy This Other AI Stock\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points Thiel sold a ton of Nvidia and Tesla stock during Q3.\nHe scooped up shares of Apple and Microsoft.\nMicrosoft is well positioned to thrive in 2026 thanks to Azure.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nFew names carry as much weight in the tech realm as Peter Thiel. He has a legendary track record, including being a part of the founding groups of both Palantir and PayPal . He was also the first outside investor in Facebook, now Meta Platforms , making it clear that he has an eye for spotting promising opportunities. When Thiel makes a move, investors should pay attention.\n\nBecause his portfolio is worth more than $100 million, his hedge fund, Thiel Macro, must report its end-of-quarter holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission within 45 days of the end of that quarter via a Form 13F . Those forms are made available to the public. So the most recent information we have on his stock moves is as of Sept. 30, but those moves are noteworthy enough to consider even three months later.\nThiel sold Tesla and Nvidia during Q3 At the end of Q2, Thiel held more than 272,000 shares of Tesla and more than 537,000 shares of Nvidia . At the end of Q3, he owned 65,000 Tesla shares and zero Nvidia shares. Those were huge divestitures, and the Nvidia sale in particular flew in the face of the trends in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm. However, Thiel didn't take these funds and invest them in completely different sectors, like industrial or healthcare. Instead, he put the proceeds of those sales into two other tech megacaps: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) .\n\nApple's AI strategy has been a flop, and it will need to make some major changes to get back in the race. As a result, I don't think Thiel was buying Apple for AI-related reasons (unless he knows something that we don't). I'm more interested in his Microsoft purchase.\nMicrosoft isn't a new holding for Thiel. He has had an on-again, off-again relationship with the stock. As of the end of Q4 2024, he owned no Microsoft shares. By the end of Q1, he owned nearly 80,000 shares. He sold all of them in Q2, then bought nearly 50,000 shares in Q3. Since Sept. 30, Microsoft's stock has declined by around 6%. So unless he has lost his faith in Microsoft, the buying opportunity now could be better than when this information was fresh.\nThe stock is also down by around 2% from June 30. This suggests that right now presents a better buying opportunity than the one that Thiel took advantage of. So should investors follow his lead and buy Microsoft?\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft is acting neutral in the AI buildout Unlike some of its peers, Microsoft chose not to build a generative AI model in-house. Instead, it opted to forge a partnership with OpenAI, and bought a meaningful stake in it. Today, Microsoft owns about 27% of the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC.\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its Copilot product, which acts as an AI assistant for its Office products, Bing search engine, and Windows OS, among other software titles. However, OpenAI's not the only generative AI model maker that Microsoft has a partnership with.\n\nIn its cloud computing segment, Microsoft Azure offers its customers access to multiple models to build applications on. Users can choose from Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, R1 from DeepSeek (a cheaper large language model from China), Meta's Llama, and others. This places Microsoft in a neutral position as a facilitator of the AI software trend. That status helped Azure achieve a jaw-dropping growth rate of 40% in Microsoft's fiscal 2026 first quarter, which ended Sept. 30.\nAzure has become the crown jewel of Microsoft's business, and if it continues to have monster success throughout 2026, Thiel's investment will pay off. Based on its results so far, Microsoft appears well positioned to remain a winner in the AI boom.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $505,641 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,143,283 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 974 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Trading At A 38% Discount?\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Insights The projected fair value for Meta Platforms is US$1,062 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$660 suggests Meta Platforms is potentially 38% undervalued\nThe US$837 analyst price target for META is 21% less than our estimate of fair value\nHow far off is Meta Platforms, Inc. ( NASDAQ:META ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model .\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nCrunching The Numbers We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$25.3b\nUS$39.6b\nUS$69.4b\nUS$90.1b\nUS$119.7b\nUS$142.7b\nUS$163.3b\nUS$181.3b\nUS$197.1b\nUS$211.1b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x13\nAnalyst x12\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x5\nEst @ 19.19%\nEst @ 14.41%\nEst @ 11.06%\nEst @ 8.72%\nEst @ 7.08%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3%\nUS$23.3k\nUS$33.7k\nUS$54.6k\nUS$65.5k\nUS$80.4k\nUS$88.5k\nUS$93.4k\nUS$95.8k\nUS$96.2k\nUS$95.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$727b\n\nStory Continues\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$211b× (1 + 3.3%) ÷ (8.3%– 3.3%) = US$4.3t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$4.3t÷ ( 1 + 8.3%) 10 = US$2.0t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.7t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$660, the company appears quite good value at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nThe Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.090. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\nSWOT Analysis for Meta Platforms Strength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Interactive Media and Services industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nLooking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

But with as we head into 2026, the story is shifting from pure growth to execution, competition, and also risk. So for more on this, we're going to bring in Bob O'Donnell. He is the president of Techlysis Research. Bob, it is great to see you here and we talked about this earlier in the year on stocks in translation. So give us an update. What do you see the AI, what has been the dominant theme of AI excuse me, I was leading you there of the AI trade this year and you know, kind of heading into next year. What are you keeping your eye on?\n00:48 Speaker B\nNo, fair enough, Jared, thanks for having me, of course. Uh yeah, I mean look, one of the things we talked about back on on that program was this notion of hybrid AI. And by hybrid AI, what I was referring to and continue to talk about is this idea that we're seeing AI being deployed of course in the big clouds and and we're seeing a lot of benefit from Google and Amazon, Microsoft and those kinds of companies, um meta as well. But we're also starting to see businesses themselves start to deploy AI. And so this hybrid AI idea is that the fact that you can do some of this uh AI computing in the cloud with the big uh LLMs, but you can also do it on your own premises or within data centers and things like that. So, that's where a lot of the excitement is because that's where there's a huge long ramp of growth and opportunity. And so that's from companies uh like Dell and HPE, Cisco, some of these other companies who sell some of the servers that the companies are buying. Of course, they include Nvidia chips or AMD chips and I think we'll see a lot more uh competition in AI accelerators in 2026 as well. But the point is a lot of those companies and then the software that they're building and creating with that is driving a whole new wave of opportunity and that's like I said, that's sort of that hybrid AI story. We saw the beginnings of it in 2025. I think we'll see a lot more of that uh in 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs.\nOther assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds.\nTo be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters.\nTom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026.\n“Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?”\nCrypto market movers Bitcoin is up 1.7% over the past 24 hours, trading at $89,135.\nEthereum is up 2% over the past 24 hours and trading at $3,040.\nWhat we’re reading Six blockbuster crypto IPOs to watch in 2026 — DL News\nBitcoin miners to tap Zaporizhzhia nuclear power — if there’s a peace deal in Ukraine — DL News\nCrypto.com to Hire In-House Market Maker for Prediction Markets — Unchained\nAlt season ‘26: What it will take — Milk Road\nFive crypto airdrops to watch for in 2026 — DL News\nLance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

I think that&rsquo;s very firmly what&rsquo;s happened over the last six months or so,&rdquo; he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs in November pointed to a boom in foreign funds buying UK stocks while Bank of America data has also suggested an uptick in stockpickers buying British. According to its figures, global investors were net 24pc underweight UK stocks in December, an improvement on November&rsquo;s figure of 29pc.\nBank of America&rsquo;s survey has only ever recorded investors being overweight the UK on two occasions since August 2021 &ndash; but it does suggest the tide could be turning.\nWhile concerns about the US have been an important factor in overseas flows into the UK, the FTSE 100&rsquo;s strong performance last year has also been a major selling point.\nBritain&rsquo;s stock market enjoyed its biggest annual gain since 2009 in 2025, beating performance on Wall Street.\n\nThe rising interest from overseas investors comes in marked contrast to UK investors, who have dramatically sold off their holdings in stocks.\nIn the six months to December, UK investors pulled more than &pound;10bn out of global stock markets in the longest and most severe period of selling on record, according to data provider Calastone.\nOver that period, UK-focused equity funds were among the hardest hit, seeing net selling of &pound;847m.\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

      "Content": "Worried About an AI Bubble? Buy This Tech Stock in 2026.\n\nBen Gran, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 6:38 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points An estimated 75% of stock market returns since November 2022 have come from AI stocks.\nIn the past six months, Apple has outperformed most AI stocks.\nApple is expecting 10%-12% revenue growth in its current quarter, with strong iPhone sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been driving some of the biggest gains in the stock market in recent years. A report from JP Morgan Asset Management found that ever since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns. Major tech companies like Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in high-powered chips and vast data centers to build the infrastructure of AI, which they hope will lead the next transformative wave of innovation and economic growth.\n\nBut in the past few months, some investors have turned skeptical about the AI stock story. In August 2025, an MIT study was published showing that 95% of generative AI projects at businesses failed to deliver a measurable return on investment. This MIT study was a potential warning sign to investors. If businesses can't figure out how to use AI to make money, save money, or be more productive and efficient, all of this AI capital expenditure (capex) spending by these major tech companies might not pay off, and would be halted.\nSome investors are concerned that AI companies are spending too much on capital expenditures for AI, that AI is not demonstrating enough clear real-world use cases and profitable product opportunities, and that the expected returns on all of this AI capex might not arrive. The AI boom might turn into an AI bubble .\n\nThe good news is that no matter what happens next with AI companies, you can still invest in a major tech stock that might not be affected by a possible AI bubble. Here's a closer look at why this company could be a good stock to buy in 2026.\nApple is outside of any AI bubble Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the world's largest and most influential tech companies, but it's not an \"AI company\" or an \"AI stock\" in the same way as Oracle , Nvidia , Microsoft, or Alphabet is. That's because Apple's not spending nearly as much on AI as these other companies, and Apple's business model doesn't depend on the future promise of AI. In fact, earlier in 2025, Apple was widely criticized for not moving fast enough on AI and being \"behind\" on AI strategy.\n\nBut Apple's patient approach to AI might turn out to be a good thing for Apple shareholders. Apple has managed to avoid getting dragged into a costly AI arms race. Instead of plowing billions of dollars into data centers, Apple has focused on its core business of selling phones and laptops. If you're worried that valuations of AI stocks have gone too high, but you don't want to give up on \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, Apple could be a good choice.\n\nStory Continues\nApple is poised to thrive in 2026 During the past six months, Apple stock is up roughly 33% while the S&P 500 is up 11%. Apple also outperformed major AI stocks like Nvidia and Oracle, and other AI-related tech stocks like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. The launch of the iPhone 17 in September 2025 was a huge success, generating blockbuster demand. Apple is expected to ship 247.4 million iPhones in 2025, a 6.1% year-over-year increase, according to IDC.\nOn its most recent earnings call, in October, Apple announced record-breaking numbers. The company earned $416 billion of revenue in its fiscal year 2025 (an all-time record), and its fourth-quarter revenue of $102.5 billion was an 8% year-over-year increase. iPhone revenue was up 6% year over year and hit a new September-ended quarter record. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.85, another September-ended quarter record, and up 13% year-over-year, excluding a one-time charge from 2024.\n\nApple's services revenue was up 15% year over year in the quarter, which is an all-time record. Services have become a major profit engine for Apple because the margins on digital services are so high compared to physical products. Apple's gross margin for services was about 75% in its latest earnings report, compared to 36% for Apple products.\nAnd the services segment is becoming a bigger slice of Apple's overall revenue. In its Q3 earnings for fiscal year 2025, Apple made more sales from services ($28.75 billion) than it made from all of its non-iPhone products combined (Macs, iPads and Wearables made $24.69 billion of sales).\nAnd there are good reasons for investor optimism about Apple to continue into 2026. The company expects to see 10%-12% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2026, with double-digit iPhone revenue growth. That quarter is wrapping up now and includes the holiday selling period. Analysts have raised their estimate for Apple's earnings per share to $2.67 for the current quarter, up from $1.77 for Q4 of Apple's fiscal 2025.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, Apple stock is not cheap compared to where its P/E ratio has been in the past few years. But if investors continue to shy away from high-priced AI stocks, and if more signs of real-world return on investment from AI don't materialize fast enough, Apple could look like a better deal than tech stocks that have more AI exposure.\nUnless some new must-have device gets invented that can replace the iPhone, Apple seems well-positioned to stay highly profitable for a long time to come. No matter what happens next with the possible AI bubble, Apple should be a good stock to buy in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?

Rhea announced the filing of a lawsuit by the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Justice against Meta Platforms (META), Inc. and the company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries – including Instagram, LLC and Facebook Holdings, LLC – to “protect the well-being and safety of the tens of thousands of U.S. Virgin Islands teens and children who use Facebook and Instagram.” In addition, VIDOJ’s complaint marks the first effort by an attorney general to address reports of rampant fraud and scams on Meta’s platforms, which impacts all Virgin Islands residents, including the elderly. The complaint includes allegations that Meta: Knowingly profited from widespread fraudulent advertising. Meta projected that 10% of its revenue in 2025, roughly $16 billion, would derive from fraudulent ads and privately acknowledged that its platforms were responsible for a third of all successful scams in the United States; Intentionally failed – despite public representations to the contrary – to crack down on fraudulent advertising citing potential impacts on profits; Detected ads it believed to be fraudulent, and rather than taking them down, charged fraudsters extra for the right to advertise scams; Allowed fraudsters to use Meta’s algorithms and user data to target the most vulnerable users; Adopted algorithms and platform designs that disabled teens from controlling their time spent on Meta’s platforms and foster addiction, problematic use, anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide; Allowed its platforms – including its social media, messaging, and virtual reality platforms – to become breeding grounds for predators who groom, solicit, and sexually exploit children, and; Publicly promised various policies and initiatives to keep consumers and children safe and privately decided not to follow through on these promises to protect the company’s bottom line.\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

Nearly two years into his marriage, Dan called \"The Ramsey Show\" amid rising tensions over housing and finances.\nAt the center of the disagreement is whether to sell a 130-year-old family farm now and pay an estimated $40,000–$50,000 in capital gains taxes, or keep the land for several more years while purchasing a home another way.\n\nAfter hearing the details, personal finance expert Dave Ramsey said the situation reflected \"two old dogs trying to learn new tricks,\" adding that the issue extended beyond financial calculations.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nA 130-Year-Old Farm And A $50,000 Question The farm in western Kansas, has been in Dan's family for about 130 years and is valued at roughly $300,000. Dan said his accountant estimated that selling it now would result in combined federal and state capital gains taxes between $40,000 and $50,000.\nHis wife prefers selling the land immediately to buy their “forever home” in cash. Dan, however, proposed a complex alternative: keeping the farm for five more years and using the annual income from wheat and milo sales to “bank” the money for the future tax bill.\n\nCo-host John Delony was quick to point out that the tax bill was likely a sign of deeper issues. \"A capital gain sounds like a distraction to me,\" he said, adding that Dan's plan was a \"complex matrix\" of variables like rain and subsidies that only served to delay a difficult decision.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

When combined with the farm equity and $110,000 Dan received from a previous home sale, the couple controls close to $500,000 in assets.

According to Forbes , he was just 23 years old at the time.\nNow, at the age of 41, Zuckerberg has an estimated $209 billion net worth .

They are the CEO, chief technology officer and chief operating officer (respectively) of an artificial intelligence (AI) recruiting startup, Mercor , which they launched back in 2023.\nThe path to billionaire status began when the trio started their business from their Harvard and Georgetown dorm rooms. In two short years, they managed to bring in seven figures annually and expand their reach to 25 different countries. By September 2025, Mercor had an annualized revenue run rate of $500 million.\n\nThe trio has also amassed hundreds of millions in funding for their company. In a funding round led by Felicis Ventures, they secured $350 million. That was in October 2025.\nMercor recently received a $10 billion valuation of their company, according to Forbes .

( NASDAQ: META ). But its third-quarter earnings report raised investor concerns about the company’s massive capital spending on artificial intelligence initiatives. In addition, Meta said it planned to make significant cuts to the budget of its Reality Labs metaverse division in the coming year. The stock is down 9.3% since the quarterly report was released.\n\nStrong quarterly reports earlier in 2025 (despite a tax charge) had lent credence to the claim that Meta would continue to outshine its competitors over the coming year. The share price hit an all-time high of $796.25 back in August. The stock is trying to recover from the pullback in November, and it is now up 12.6% year over year, narrowly underperforming the broader market. Furthermore, the near-term future of the economy is uncertain—just like the markets themselves—and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a controversial figure. Certainly, Zuckerberg's sudden shift to the metaverse and brand name change to Meta Platforms raised a few eyebrows several years ago.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Meta Platforms Inc.’s ( NASDAQ: META ) AI push has been a key driver for the company in 2025, with integrations coming across numerous platforms, which is fueling engagement and increasing ad sales.\nDespite economic cloudiness, Meta announced that its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) estimate increased significantly, much of which will be allocated to AI project development and integration.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality.",

      "Content": "Invest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Meta Platforms Inc\n\nGuruFocus News\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's ( NASDAQ:META ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with META.\nIs META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2026-01-01, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $706.47. It's currently trading at a price of $660.09. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 6.57%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$22.61\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.16%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 25.40% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n469.82\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n544.46\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n706.47\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $541.53. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -21.89%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Even if they don't, the company can quickly pivot.\n10 stocks we like better than Intuitive Surgical ›\nWhatever their investing style -- growth, value, income, or other -- everyone loves beating the market. However, doing so over a relatively long period is no easy feat. That's why hedge fund managers who consistently pull it off become big names on Wall Street.\nThe good news is that even average investors who aren't paid to pick stocks can still beat the market. To help you achieve that, let's discuss two corporations that might deliver above-average returns through 2031: Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) .\n1. Intuitive Surgical In fairness, Intuitive Surgical hasn't had a great past 12 months. Increased tariffs are affecting its financial results, and competition in its robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) niche, which it dominates, is intensifying. However, several things could drive Intuitive Surgical's stock much higher in the next few years. One of them is the launch of the newest version of its da Vinci system, which is now in its fifth iteration. Each has been better than the last, and this time is no different.\n\nOne key new feature of the latest da Vinci system is Force Feedback Technology, which enables surgeons to have a better sense of the pressure they are exerting on patients' tissue during procedures, allowing them to make adjustments as needed to avoid damage and trauma.\nThis could lead to even better outcomes for patients, something that will help increase demand for the company's technology, both from healthcare providers and consumers. This da Vinci system is still new -- it was only launched last year and has been well-received. We're still in the early innings of this story, though.\nAnother important growth driver for Intuitive Surgical should be approvals across newer indications, which help boost its procedure volume, an important driver of revenue growth. Intuitive Surgical recently announced three new approvals for one of its da Vinci systems.\n\nThat's all well and good, but can the company address its challenges? It can, and doing so may jolt its stock. Tariffs pose dangers, including increased costs, lower profits, and narrower margins. Intuitive Surgical could get around that problem in several ways, most notably by increasing its prices. The company benefits from pricing power due to its best-in-class devices, which have been proven to improve patient outcomes.\n\nStory continues\nWith a large installed base, relatively modest price hikes across the board could have a meaningful effect. If the threat of tariffs persists, my view is that Intuitive Surgical will eventually adopt a multipronged approach to addressing it, including leveraging its pricing power.\nWhat about competition? Medtronic , a medical device leader, recently earned approval in the U.S. for its Hugo system in urologic procedures, but it will likely take years before it poses a significant challenge to Intuitive Surgical.\n\nBesides, since the RAS market is underpenetrated, there is room for multiple winners. Therefore, Intuitive Surgical's outlook is robust and could enable it to outperform broader equities through 2031.\n2. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms' shares recently dropped after it released its third-quarter earnings. Its results were fairly strong, but the market is increasingly worried that Meta's huge investments in artificial intelligence (AI) -- where it is planning to pour even more funds -- may not pay off. However, the company's work in AI has made meaningful contributions so far. Between Meta Platforms' AI-powered algorithms boosting engagement across its websites and apps, and the company's AI-based efforts to automate much of the ad launch process, revenue and earnings have been growing rapidly.\n\nMeta Platforms has even bigger ambitions. The company wants to completely automate ad campaigns by the end of 2026, for instance. Given the tech leader's large ecosystem of more than 3 billion daily active users, its efforts should continue paying off.\nBut what if they don't match the level of investments the company is making? It's worth noting that something like this has happened before. Meta Platforms got its current name partly due to its then-focus on building and monetizing the metaverse, an ambition that never quite materialized, at least not anywhere near the level management had hoped.\nWhen faced with mounting expenses and declining revenue growth, partly due to its metaverse investments and broader economic challenges, Meta Platforms was able to rein in costs, refocus on its highly profitable advertising business, and ultimately emerge as a stronger company. In other words, the corporation has enough flexibility to handle the kind of challenging situation the market fears will happen in a few years.\n\nMeanwhile, its financial results should remain robust, driving its stock price higher. These are all good reasons that Meta Platforms can beat the market through 2031.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?

      "Content": "Meta Platforms Just Bought AI Agent Startup Manus. Should You Buy META Stock?\n\nNauman Khan\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) stocks have been at the center of Wall Street’s attention lately, but behind the headlines and hype, investors are really searching for companies that can turn AI ambition into real-world products and lasting profits. Not every tech giant has managed that balance, which is why each major AI move still matters to the market.\n\nThat’s precisely what puts Meta Platforms (META) back in focus. The company’s recent acquisition of AI agent startup Manus isn’t just another headline-grabbing deal; it’s a clear signal that Meta wants AI to play a deeper, more practical role across its apps and business tools. Manus’ technology is built to handle everyday tasks like research, coding, and data analysis, areas where AI can quickly become indispensable.\nMore News from Barchart Dear UiPath Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 2\nHow to Buy PYPL for a 29% Discount, or Achieve a 7% Annual Return\nApple is an Analyst Favorite, But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best Play\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nFor long-term investors, this move raises an important question. Does buying Manus make META stock more compelling right now?\nMeta Stock Performance Meta Platforms is the parent of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other social apps used by some 3.5+ billion people daily. It dominates digital ads and is aggressively pivoting toward AI and the metaverse. Unlike pure-play AI startups, Meta combines technology platforms with a massive social network ecosystem. The company currently boasts a market cap of $1.7 trillion, making it one of the members of the “Magnificent 7” elite group.\n\nMeta shares have rebounded strongly in 2025. The stock has climbed over 13% year-to-date (YTD) amid strong ad sales and AI optimism. On charts, the stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, signaling continued momentum, and well above its mid-April lows.\nFollowing the rally, META's valuation appears stretched, with metrics like price-to-book at 9, vastly higher than the sector median of 2, indicating an expensive stock. Additionally, the price-to-sales ratio is 9, significantly above the sector median of 1, further emphasizing its overvaluation. However, investors should note that high-growth stocks will often trade at premium multiples, reflecting expectations of stronger future sales and earnings.\nAcquisition News: Manus Deal On Dec. 30, Reuters reported that Meta agreed to buy Manus, a startup claiming to build the world’s first general AI agent. Manus’s technology can autonomously perform tasks with minimal prompts (beyond typical chatbots), and the company relocated to Singapore from China earlier in 2025. “Meta will operate and sell the Manus service and integrate it into its consumer and business products, including in Meta AI,” Reuters noted. Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett praised the fit with Meta’s vision, calling it “a natural fit into Meta’s fast-growing WhatsApp SMB footprint, with extensions into Mark Zuckerberg’s agentic-rich vision of personal AI.”\n\nStory Continues\nIn practice, the Manus acquisition should help Meta deliver more advanced assistant-like features to users and advertisers. Investors will watch how quickly Manus’s tech is brought into products (e.g., Meta’s consumer AI and business tools). However, the Chinese roots of Manus may attract U.S. scrutiny amid geopolitical tensions.\n\nOverall, this move signals Meta doubling down on AI, which could accelerate future revenue via better ad tech and new AI services if regulators don’t intervene.\nMeta Platforms Beats Q3 Revenue Beat Meta Platforms reported third-quarter revenue of $51.24 billion, up about 26% year-over-year (YoY), beating consensus. While operating income held near historical levels, with an operating margin of about 40%, even as costs rose versus a year earlier. Total costs and expenses increased roughly 30%, reflecting higher AI-related spending.\n\nNet income was $2.71 billion, and diluted EPS was $1.05 for the quarter after Meta booked a one-time, noncash income-tax provision of about $15.93 billion tied to recent tax legislation; excluding that charge, adjusted net income would have been roughly $18.64 billion, about $7.25 a share.\nManagement signalled bigger near-term outlays for AI. For full-year 2025, Meta now expects total expenses in the range of about $116 billion to $118 billion and capital expenditures of roughly $70 billion to $72 billion, and it guided fourth-quarter revenue to about $56 billion to $59 billion.\nThe tax charge and higher spending expectations weighed on sentiment. Analysts note the underlying business, ad demand, and user metrics remain broadly healthy, but investors will want to watch the execution of the AI build-out and the pace of monetization.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Say About META Stock? Wall Street is generally optimistic about Meta. Big banks have seen significant appreciation, supported by robust advertising and Meta's long-term AI vision.\nIn mid-December, Morgan Stanley restated its “Overweight” rating, and the company has a one-year price target of approximately $853, representing 30% upside from current prices. The company is optimistic that Meta's expanded ad capabilities will boost income despite increased spending.\n\nGoldman Sachs maintained its “Buy” rating, though analyst Eric Sheridan raised his price target to $870.\nRBC Capital Markets reduced its target by approximately $810, bringing it below $840. The firm said most investors view Meta's AI activities as untested, which, if successful, could support long-term revenue growth.\nBarclays and Raymond James, in contrast, reduced their targets to $770 from $825 due to the fears that high expenses and massive capital investments might narrow down the returns in the near term.\nOverall, analysts see continued upside if AI-driven advertising momentum holds, with a consensus “Strong Buy” rating and an average 12-month price target of $840, which suggests an expected upside of around 26% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revenue Machine You'll Want to Watch in 2026 (Hint: It's Beaten Everyone Except Nvidia)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 8:34 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Most of the discussion surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has to do with infrastructure spending.\nTo date, few companies have meaningfully monetized their AI investments.\nMeta Platforms is quietly outpacing its peers in terms of AI-driven revenue.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\nIt's no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) has been the main theme fueling the action on Wall Street over the last few years. Specifically, the levels of demand for high-performance GPUs, networking equipment, and data centers have dominated the bulk of the AI narrative to date.\n\nBut what about monetization? Assessing which companies -- other than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- are truly generating measurable AI-driven growth can be challenging.\nIn my view, AI-focused investors should keep Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) on their radar in 2026. While its megacap peers are receiving the lion's share of the attention, the social media leader could be on the cusp of becoming AI's next big contributor.\nMeta's AI revenue is leaving the competition in the dust Meta owns and operates four massive social media platforms -- Facebook, Messenger, Instagram , and WhatsApp. Across its \"family of apps,\" the company serves 3.5 billion daily active users, on average. So it's not surprising that advertisers are eager to get in front of Meta's massive audience.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Meta generated $51.2 billion in revenue, $50 billion of which came from its advertising segment. This represented 26% growth year over year. While that's impressive, it was not enough to get Wall Street excited.\nWhere things get interesting is how Meta is maintaining its growth profile. Within its AI division, Meta introduced a product called Advantage+, a suite of machine learning tools that helps advertisers improve their targeted campaigns.\nOn the company's third-quarter earnings call, CFO Susan Li told investors that Advantage+ is now operating at a $60 billion annual revenue run rate. That was nearly a threefold increase from the first quarter.\nBeth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, drew an interesting parallel between Meta's growth and that of OpenAI. ChatGPT was released to the public in November 2022, just over three years ago. According to numerous media outlets, OpenAI is expected to achieve a $20 billion revenue run rate in 2025. During this same period, Meta grew its AI ads business from essentially nothing to $60 billion -- 3 times more than OpenAI.\nTaking this one step further, Kindig wrote that \"it would require a step-up from 175% growth YoY to 460% year-over-year for Microsoft to match Meta's AI revenue.\"\n\nStory Continues\nAgainst this backdrop, Kindig posits that Meta has quietly become the second-largest AI monetizer next to Nvidia.\nCash flow could be modest in 2026 While Kindig's analysis is interesting, investors shouldn't get too hung up on the hierarchy of AI-related sales. The more important takeaway from her analysis is that Meta's top-line growth appears muted compared to the accelerating sales growth of its emerging AI products.\nAs I alluded to earlier, most of the chatter surrounding AI over the last few years has been about spending. Perhaps no other company is under more scrutiny in this regard than Meta.\nIts capital expenditures are far outpacing the rate at which its revenue is increasing. In the long run, this is unsustainable.\n\nIt's no wonder investors became spooked after Meta's management said that its capex would be \"notably larger\" in 2026. The combination of aggressive spending and a new revenue stream that has not yet matured will almost certainly hinder Meta's ability to generate excess cash flow in 2026.\nIs Meta stock a good buy right now? While I agree with Kindig in the sense that most investors are probably overlooking the magnitude and potential of Meta's new AI ads business, prudent investors aren't going to jump into the stock based on one metric.\nOver the last year, Meta's stock has traversed a number of peaks and valleys. The pronounced sell-offs were in large part influenced by investors' wariness about the company's spending.\nGiven its achievements so far and the trajectory of Advantage+, I'm personally cautiously optimistic about its prospects. However, it still has a lot to prove against Amazon , Alphabet , and others.\n\nFor these reasons, smart investors should be on the lookout for specific updates regarding Advantage+ and Meta's other AI ambitions. If these products continue to blossom and position the company to grow faster than its current spending trajectory in the long run, I would take advantage of any selling pressure and buy the dip in the new year.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

(NASDAQ: PTRN ) is one of the best low priced technology stocks to buy according to analysts . On December 11, Jefferies lowered the firm’s price target on Pattern Group to $20 from $21 with a Buy rating on the shares. The firm’s 2026 outlook suggests being highly selective with Internet equities. Jefferies cites two main headwinds: rising costs that could stall margin growth, and fears that AI will cut out the middleman, making investors less willing to pay a premium for these stocks.\n\nAdditionally, on December 3, Pattern Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRN) announced its acquisition of ROI Hunter, which is a performance-driven retail media platform. ROI Hunter specializes in integrating marketing, product, and merchandising data to facilitate SKU-level advertising decisions. This acquisition is designed to support Pattern Group’s AI-driven capabilities across major walled-garden platforms, specifically Google, Meta, and Snap, by providing a unified source of truth for global brands.\nThe acquisition follows a strong financial period for Pattern Group, where the company reported revenue of $639.7 million in Q3 2025, which was a 46% increase over the previous year. A key driver of this performance was a record NRR of 122%, indicating significant organic growth from existing brand partners compared to 113% in the same period last year. Looking ahead to Q4 2025, Pattern Group expects continued growth with revenue projected between $680 million and $700 million.\n\nPattern Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRN) accelerates various brands on e-commerce marketplaces using proprietary technology and AI.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of PTRN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: META ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg's massive bet on the Metaverse, arguing the roughly $77 billion spent on the project represents not just a corporate loss, but a broader economic failure that carries real social costs.\nZuckerberg Threw $77 Billion In his newsletter on Monday titled “Did Mark Zuckerberg Throw $77 Billion of Our Money into the Toilet?” Baker said that while Meta's Metaverse ambitions could be viewed as “just a mistaken investment decision, of the sort companies make all the time,” the scale of the spending made it far more consequential.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nHe said that when Zuckerberg invested $77 billion into Meta's virtual reality push, he effectively diverted scarce talent and physical resources away from more productive uses.\n“The flip side to this story is that when companies make stupid investment decisions, as it seems Zuckerberg did with the $77 billion he threw into Meta, it is not just a loss on their books, but also a cost to society,” he said.\nHe noted that software engineers, planners and support staff were tied up in the project for years, alongside physical inputs such as office space, computing equipment and large amounts of electricity.\n\nBaker, who co-founded the Center for Economic and Policy Research, added that these same resources “could have otherwise been productively employed,” suggesting even the construction materials used for Meta's expansion could have instead supported “affordable housing in the expensive Bay Area.”\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nBaker said the failed Metaverse bet becomes especially relevant as major technology firms now pour hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence.\nHe warned that the AI investment boom is already reshaping the economy, fueling growth by absorbing top engineering talent while simultaneously placing heavy strain on power grids and complicating climate goals.\n\nThe central question, Baker concluded, is whether Zuckerberg has become a more disciplined steward of capital since the Metaverse era. “We are likely to learn the answer in 2026.”\nMeta did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for a comment on this.

      "Content": "Inside OpenAI's $1.5 million compensation packages\n\nCatherine Baab\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 5:48 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nOpenAI is paying its employees at levels that have little precedent in Silicon Valley history — $1.5 million in stock-based compensation per employee in 2025. That’s according to financial projections shared with investors and first reported by the Wall Street Journal .\nSuch compensation dwarfs what earlier generations of tech giants paid their workforces before going public. Adjusted for inflation, OpenAI's equity payouts are multiples above the norm for large tech firms over the past two decades, and even several times higher than what Alphabet or Meta disclosed ahead of their IPOs.\n\nFerocious competition for AI talent The $1.5 million figure makes clear just how fierce the competition is for top AI talent, with compensation for individual employees beginning to resemble packages that were once reserved for founders .\nAs generative AI models become central to corporate strategy, researchers and engineers with the most relevant expertise are becoming some of the most expensive employees anywhere in the world. To retain current employees and win sought-after job candidates, rival research labs and tech giants must make staggering offers .\n\nA classic example of \"prisoner's dilemma\" In game theory, such a dynamic is known as “ prisoner's dilemma ,” which describes situations in which competition effectively forces participants to escalate costs beyond what any individual would prefer.\nIn this case, if leading AI firms collectively capped compensation, they'd all benefit from lower costs and less-diluted equity. But no single company can afford restraint when competitors are bidding aggressively — not when falling behind in talent means falling behind in the technology itself. The result is a bidding war none of the participants can escape, even as it pushes the economics of AI development into increasingly unprecedented territory.\n\nAccordingly, OpenAI has had to loosen internal equity rules to stay competitive. One recent change removed a waiting period that required employees to stay six months before stock awards began vesting — a nod to a job market where researchers frequently move between companies and can command immediate payouts.\nCompensation now consumes 50% of OpenAI's revenue For OpenAI, this compensation strategy carries steep costs — in several senses. The company has about 4,000 employees at present, and stock compensation now consumes about half of the company’s annual revenue. That’s an unusually high share that likely contributes to operating losses and, at the same time, functions to dilute existing shareholders.\n\nStory Continues\nIn historical terms, the numbers are even more jarring. Among major tech companies that eventually went public, stock-based compensation typically accounted for a modest, single-digit percentage of revenue in pre-IPO years. But at OpenAI, it now approaches 50%.\nWhat’s more, per Wall Street Journal reporting , OpenAI’s investor materials suggest those costs will keep rising for years, even as the company continues to invest heavily in infrastructure and development.\nSo, can it last? Whether the strategy proves sustainable or not, it captures something essential about the contemporary tech economy. The overall pattern is familiar — a handful of firms create world-historical value while a tiny fraction of workers capture most of the gains — but the scale makes earlier booms look quaint. OpenAI is just making the math more explicit and more extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

This is AI Weekly. :: AI Weekly Meta has said it will buy Chinese-founded startup Manus as the tech giant accelerates efforts to integrate advanced AI across its platforms. Financial terms were not released, but a source told Reuters the deal values Manus at between $2 billion and $3 billion. Manus went viral early this year on X after it released what it claimed was the world's first general AI agent, capable of making decisions and executing tasks autonomously with less prompting than ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The company was cheered by Chinese state television, with commentators calling it China's next DeepSeek. Nvidia is reportedly scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies. And according to sources, has approached contract manufacturer TSMC to ramp up production. They added that Chinese tech firms have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds just 700,000 units in stock. SoftBank Group said it completed a $41 billion investment in OpenAI. The move is one of the largest-ever private funding rounds that would give the Japanese firm a stake of about 11% in the ChatGPT maker. Artificial intelligence software developer Eliza Labs has ended its lawsuit accusing billionaire Elon Musk’s X Corp of extracting valuable information from the company before launching copycat AI products. A federal judge in Texas dismissed the case, after Eliza Labs and X said that they agreed to dismissal with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be refiled. X had denied wrongdoing. And as global markets closed out the year, they remained buoyed by strong fundamentals and rising capital flows into growth markets, amplified by an AI-driven investment boom. And that is expected to continue into 2026 as investors keep channelling capital into AI-linked infrastructure, foundries and supply chains. As well as betting on growth from data centers, advanced chip making, and next-generation computing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

They may continue it a little bit into 2024, but, you know, the dollar may, you know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cost average in, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just uh hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump 2.0, stocks soar again, gold hits records, AI boom rolls on — Yahoo Finance's 2025 year in review\n\nMyles Udland · Head of News\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 17 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGC=F\n\nBRK.A\n\nBTC-USD\n\nGOOG\n\nWhen the closing bell rings on Wall Street Wednesday afternoon, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) will clinch its third straight year of double-digit gains and end the year near a record high. Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on the year ahead too.\nPowered by the artificial intelligence trade once again, the 2025 financial markets story might seem, on the surface, to be a rerun of what investors lived through in 2023 and 2024.\n\nShine a bit of light on the subject, however, and we see the inner workings of the market's path in 2025 spun an eventful story that won't soon be forgotten.\nDonald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president.\nThe largest company in the world lost nearly 20% of its value in a single day.\nThe S&P 500 registered its worst week since the COVID crash of 2020, crashing 10% in just two days.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%.\nGold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year in two generations. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

      "Content": "These Stocks Are the Market’s Biggest Winners and Losers in 2025\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nUpdated Wed, December 31, 2025 at 3:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nLULU\n\nTSLA\n\nCOIN\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index is poised to end 2025 up more than 17% as the bull market continues for a third year driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.\nThe AI trade broadened out this year, as chip stocks again led the S&P 500 but were joined by the shares of companies tied to building the data centers that will power the technology. Three of the index’s top 10 performers in 2025 were data storage companies, which are among the main beneficiaries of the hundreds of billions of dollars in pledged spending by the giant AI cloud service providers known as hyperscalers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nOn the flip side, economic uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs weighed on the shares of consumer companies, while health-care stocks struggled with uncertainty surrounding the administration’s policies and pressure on drug prices.\nHere are some of the biggest winners and losers in the US stock market this year.\n\nWinner: New AI Leadership Technology stocks, especially those tied to AI, again dominated the market. But leadership shifted to the shares of companies associated with data — from storage to the building, heating and cooling of data centers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ) Corp., Amazon.com ( AMZN ) Inc., Alphabet ( GOOG ) Inc. and Meta Platforms ( META ) Inc. have pledged to spend more than $440 billion over the next 12 months to build out AI capabilities, benefiting firms such as Sandisk ( SNDK ) Corp., Western Digital ( WDC ) Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc ( STX ), which were three of the four best performing stocks in the S&P 500.\nWinner: New S&P 500 Additions A slew of companies were added to the S&P 500 in 2025, including Robinhood ( HOOD ) Markets Inc., Sandisk, AppLovin ( APP ) Corp. and Carvana ( CVNA ) Co., all of which posted triple-digit percentage gains and landed among the top 20 performers in the index.\nOf course, not every stock that joined the S&P 500 got a boost. Trade Desk ( TTD ) Inc. shares were the worst performers in the index with a nearly 70% loss, while Block ( XYZ ) Inc. tumbled more than 20% and Coinbase ( COIN ) Global Inc. sank more than 6%.\n\nWinner: Palantir Palantir ( PLTR ) Technologies Inc. shares are set to notch a triple-digit gain for the third year in a row. The software developer got a boost from AI enthusiasm and strong buy-in from retail traders who are drawn to the company’s outspoken Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp.\n\nBut the stock is now rather pricey. With a multiple of more than 180 times forward earnings, it’s the third most expensive member of the S&P 500 behind Tesla Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWinner: Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ) soared almost 175% in 2025 on the strength of takeover speculation. The company formally put itself up for sale in October, and there’s an ongoing battle between the top two bidders, Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) Corp. and Netflix ( NFLX ) Inc., with both suitors jockeying to strengthen financial backing for their offers.\nThe Warner Bros. board prefers the Netflix bid and is reportedly planning to reject Paramount’s offer, but Larry Ellison, the billionaire chairman of Oracle Corp. and father of Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison, is personally guaranteeing the Paramount proposal.\nLoser: Consumer Staples Economic uncertainty, tariffs and concerns about the health of the US consumer as inflation creeps higher weighed on consumer stocks, especially some major staples names. Clorox ( CLX ) Co., frozen french fries maker Lamb Weston ( LW ) Holdings Inc., Campbell’s ( CPB ) Co. and beverage giant Constellation Brands ( STZ ) Inc. were among the 20 worst-performers in the S&P 500. Shares of fast-casual dining brand Chipotle ( CMG ) Mexican Grill Inc. sank nearly 40% after two years of double-digit gains.\n\nLoser: Retail The same economic uncertainty also hit shares of some retail companies. Deckers ( DECK ) Outdoor Corp., which owns brands such as Hoka and Ugg, was down almost 50% in 2025, snapping a nine-year streak of gains. The stock was hit hard by a few weak earnings forecasts and analyst downgrades.\nLululemon ( LULU ) Athletica Inc. shares are set to fall nearly 45% this year, their second consecutive double-digit annual decline, as the athletic apparel retailer struggles through an overhaul after a period of slow growth and the recent exit of its chief executive officer. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in the company.\n\nLoser: Managed Care Health insurance stocks underperformed in 2025 despite hopes that the group would benefit from a shift in policy by the Trump administration. Molina ( MOH ) Healthcare Inc. shares were down more than 40%, their second straight year of double-digit declines. UnitedHealth ( UNH ) Group Inc. and Centene ( CNC ) Corp. have both shed more than 30%, putting them among the 25 worst performers in the S&P 500.\nStill, there are signs of hope for the group as some investors view the beaten-down valuations as attractive, making the stocks possibly due for a rebond. Money manager Michael Burry has said he’s long Molina shares and that he views the company as acquisition target in 2026 if it remains this cheap.\n\n—With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta Platforms (META) Increases Despite Market Slip: Here's What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nMeta Platforms (META) closed at $666.01 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.11% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.14% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.24%.\nThe social media company's shares have seen an increase of 2.78% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.94%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $8.16, indicating a 1.75% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $58.4 billion, showing a 20.69% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $23.04 per share and revenue of $199.46 billion. These totals would mark changes of -3.44% and +21.25%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 1.71% upward. Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note Meta Platforms's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 28.59. This denotes a discount relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 28.78.\n\nIt's also important to note that META currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.73. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.85 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 62, finds itself in the top 26% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "An AI super-bull who just backed the Nvidia-Groq deal warns of a data center bust: ‘We foresee a significant financial crisis’\n\nEva Roytburg\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 11:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nEQIX\n\nMSFT\n\nCIFR\n\nOne of the most aggressive backers of the AI boom—whose firm most recently facilitated Nvidia’s largest deal ever —has issued a warning to the rest of the market: The “build it and they will come” approach to data centers is a dangerous gamble.\nAlex Davis, chief executive of Austin-based investment firm Disruptive, wrote in a letter to investors he expects a “significant financing crisis” to hit the speculative data-center market as soon as 2027 or 2028, driven by extreme capital expenditure and a growing mismatch between who is constructing AI infrastructure and who will ultimately use it.\n\n“We are seeing way too many business models (and valuation levels) with no realistic margin expansion story, extreme capex spend, lack of enterprise customer traction, or overdependence on “roundtrip” investments – in some cases all with the same company,” Davis wrote.\nDavis’ warning was first reported by Axios .\nThe warning comes just days after Nvidia agreed to license assets from Groq, a high-performance AI chipmaking startup Disruptive has backed since its founding (not to be confused with Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot). The transaction, which Davis has said is valued at roughly $20 billion in cash, represents the largest deal Nvidia has ever completed and underscores how aggressively the company is moving to lock up all the verticals in AI talent and intellectual property.\n\nYet, Davis argues the same exuberance driving landmark transactions at the chip level is also fueling excess elsewhere in the AI stack, particularly among third-party data-center developers betting on what he called the “build it and they will come” model.\n“If you’re a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers,” Davis wrote in the letter. “We want to back the owner-users, not the speculative landlords.”\nThe risk, as the venture capitalist sees it, is not that demand for AI compute disappears, but rather that capital has rushed into the wrong hands. While hyperscalers and well-capitalized tech companies can absorb massive upfront costs, speculative landlords rely on short-term financing and customers that may never materialize at scale.\nDavis didn’t name names in his letter, but if you follow his distinction about “speculative landlords” versus “owner/users” like Microsoft and Meta that will eventually build their own facilities, the most obvious targets could be the legacy wholesale giants like Digital Realty and Equinix .\n\nStructured as something called “real estate investment trusts,” these companies generate returns by developing and leasing capacity to the same tech giants Davis predicts will soon cut out to capture margins themselves. If that shift accelerates, it could leave landlords facing refinancing pressure just as a wave of debt comes due, even if overall demand for AI compute continues to rise. That imbalance, he warned, could place significant stress on private credit markets and ripple outward if financing conditions tighten.\n\nStory Continues\nDigital Realty and Equinix did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nDavis’ argument echoes warnings made on the other side of the aisle, including the thesis of famed short-seller Jim Chanos , who explicitly bets against “neoclouds” and converted crypto-miners like Cipher Mining. Chanos has argued that data center hosting is becoming a “commodity business,” warning clients that “the magic and the money is going to come from what the chips produce ultimately, not where they reside.” Both investors seem to agree that while the AI technology itself is valuable, the third-party landlords rushing to house it are walking into a trap.\n\nYet the caution is startling coming from Davis, who said in the letter that he remains deeply bullish on AI itself. Disruptive has deployed billions of dollars across private technology companies it views as core to the AI economy, including Groq, open-source model developers, and defense-oriented software firms. Davis describes the current wave of AI innovation as a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.\n“While I continue to believe the ongoing advancements in AI technology present ‘once in a lifetime’ investment opportunities, I also continue to see risks and reason for caution and investment discipline,” he wrote.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta buys startup Manus in latest move to advance its artificial intelligence efforts\n\nAssociated Press Finance\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:02 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nDETROIT (AP) — Meta is buying artificial intelligence startup Manus, as the owner of Facebook and Instagram continues an aggressive push to amp up AI offerings across its platforms.\nThe California tech giant declined to disclose financial details of the acquisition. But The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta closed the deal at more than $2 billion.\n\nManus, a Singapore-based platform with some Chinese roots, launched its first “general-purpose” AI agent earlier this year. The platform offers paid subscriptions for customers to use this technology for research, coding and other tasks.\n“Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide,” Meta said in a Monday announcement, adding that it plans to scale this service — as Manus will “deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including in Meta AI.”\nXiao Hong, CEO of Manus, added that joining Meta will allow the platform to “build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made.” Manus confirmed that it would continue to sell and operate subscriptions through its own app and website.\n\nThe platform has grown rapidly over the past year. Earlier this month, Manus announced that it had crossed the $100 million mark in annual recurring revenue, just eight months after launching.\nSome of Manus' initial financial backers reportedly included China's Tencent Holdings, ZhenFund and HSG. And the company that first launched the platform — Butterfly Effect, which also operates under the name monica.im, which was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that there would be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” following its transaction, and that the platform would also discontinue its services and operations in China. Manus reiterated that it would continue to operate in Singapore, where most of its employees are based.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been pushing to revive its commercial AI efforts as the company faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI , maker of ChatGPT. In June, the company made a $14.3 billion investment in AI data company Scale and recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang to help lead a team developing “superintelligence” at the tech giant.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Uh, I talked a little bit about it yesterday, kind of continuing the theme of uh what Nvidia did with Groq that that big $20 billion deal. Today, we have this deal, Manus spending two, uh I should say Meta spending $2 billion to buy Manus. What does that signal to you about the AI trade?\n00:18 Josh\nYeah, I I it's good to be with you, Brian. Yeah, it seems like, you know, there's certainly a an overall theme in the market of a lot of cash on balance sheets. You know, the S&P has about, the S&P companies about $7 trillion in cash. I think with AI, it's like an arms race.\n00:32 Josh\nyou know, these small companies are obviously being bought up and they don't mean anything to the average investor, but, you know, it's kind of, I think time is of the essence and instead of developing these technologies on their own, a lot of companies, you know, are just going to the M&A market and it it signals an urgency that uh, you know, we haven't seen in a while on the part of a of a sector of the economy.\n00:52 Brian\nBrooke, poll 5,000 people yesterday and I would argue they never even heard of Manus before.\n00:57 Josh\nNo.\n00:59 Brian\nGo ahead, Brooke.\n01:00 Brooke\nDefinitely have not heard of Manuse. I I mean or Manis or rather. But basically what we're hearing from Wall Street this morning is that this is really Meta's way of getting in on the action as Josh alluded to. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts saying largely that this purchase expands Meta's former AI agent test capabilities as it currently lacks applications built on foundations. Think about it, you have chat GBT, you have Google Gemini, you have Anthropic, Claude and so really what was needed here was something like this for Meta to really get in the game.\n01:29 Brooke\nThey said they're going to spend billions of dollars on data projects in the coming years. And so really investors are waiting on that key return of this investment and how this plays out and that certainly gives Meta the reality of this. Also, this company really kind of getting in on the action here, this startup, really getting in uh on Meta's uh on a good note, getting in where it's early on. Meta can really mold this over the next couple of years to make it what it is.\n01:49 Brian\nAnd Ines, I love seeing these deals. Nvidia for Groq, $20 billion, Meta dropping $2 billion on this company I I would argue not a lot of folks that even heard of. It really pushes back on that AI bubble thesis.\n01:58 Ines\n100%. And if you take a look at what this company is, I mean, they have, they launched in March of 2024. So it really speaks to the speed of where AI is going. This is not just a chatbot. It is much more sophisticated from what I've seen compared to Google Gemini, compared to Chat GBT because it actually can do things for you.\n02:18 Ines\nI mean if you look at their, one of their videos online about what this can do for recruiters, it can look through resumes, it'll give you a synopsis and get recommendations. When your laptop is even off, you can it's still running for you, the program's still running. It can do property research, it can build websites, it can make videos. It does so much more. So the fact that Meta has acquired this company at such an early stage, really signals where this agent AI uh is going and the the big, big capabilities that you're seeing within AI.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the fund, please call (833) 759-6110 or visit the Fund's website.\n\nDistributor: Foreside Fund Services, LLC\nMedia Contact:\nMatthew Tuttle\nTuttle Capital Management\nmtuttle@tuttlecap.com\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/279159\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta to Buy Manus, an AI Startup With Chinese Roots\n\nKurt Wagner, Luz Ding and Lulu Yilun Chen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:44 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTCEHY\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to buy Manus, a popular Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, in its effort to build a business around its massive AI investment.\nThe deal values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a rare US acquisition of an Asian tech company and the latest multibillion-dollar AI bet from Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The agreement was struck in about 10 days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are not public.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nMeta intends to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating the technology into its products, it said in a statement. Backed by some of China’s biggest names including Tencent Holdings Ltd., ZhenFund and HSG, Manus shot to prominence early this year not long after DeepSeek’s debut. All of its existing investors have been bought out in Meta’s takeover, one of the people said. It's unclear whether severing Chinese ties will ease government concerns at a time when the Asian nation and the US are vying for AI dominance.\n“There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson said. Manus' parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\n\nZuckerberg has made AI his company’s top priority, and is spending billions to hire researchers, build data centers and develop new models. Manus had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year from selling its AI agent to businesses via subscriptions, which could give Meta a more immediate return on some of its AI spending.\nThe Manus AI agent can complete a handful of general tasks, such as screening resumes, creating trip itineraries and analyzing stocks in response to basic instructions. Butterfly Effect raised money earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in an investment round led by US venture capital firm Benchmark.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nMeta's purchase of Manus is likely aimed at expanding the former's AI agent task capabilities, as it currently lacks applications built on its own foundation model compared to a broader application ecosystem for ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. While the deal marks an early step for Meta to build a subscription and API business around its AI investment, it could draw regulatory scrutiny given that Singapore-based Manus was founded in China.\n\nStory Continues\n— Mandeep Singh and Robert Biggar, BI analysts\nAI agents are tools that don’t need human supervision to perform specific digital tasks. Enterprise software companies such as Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. have heavily promoted their versions of agents as the most effective way for businesses to use the emerging technology, rather than generative AI features such as chatbots, which require user prompts and interaction.\n\nMeta already has an AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available through the company’s social media and messaging platforms — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — in addition to its AI glasses. The US company is acquiring the technology and leadership group from Manus, though its statement didn’t detail where the new team will sit within the organization. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the deal’s value, said Manus co-founder and CEO Xiao Hong will report to Javier Olivan, chief operating officer of Meta, citing people familiar with the acquisition.\nAlexandr Wang, Meta’s Chief AI Officer who joined this summer as part of a high-profile investment into his startup, welcomed the Manus team of about 100 staff with a post on X. In his own message on the platform, Manus’ Xiao said that the deal would help his company expand the reach of its agents. “The era of AI that doesn’t just talk, but acts, creates, and delivers, is only beginning,” he wrote. “And now, we get to build it at a scale we never could have imagined.”\n\nMeta’s aggressive spending to compete in the AI race is matched by rivals like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. Zuckerberg has pledged to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure projects over the next three years, many of them expected to be AI-related. The company has hired an expensive team of researchers to develop a new state-of-the-art AI model it plans to debut next spring, and has faced some skepticism from investors who worry that the heavy spending won’t result in meaningful revenue anytime soon.\nVC firm Benchmark was criticized earlier this year by lawmakers and other venture investors for backing an AI company with ties to China. “Who thinks it is a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me,” US Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, wrote in a post on X in May. Benchmark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Meta deal Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the deal during a regular press briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday referred reporters to relevant regulatory agencies without elaborating.\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Philip Glamann.\n(Updates with US-China context in third paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens News of the day for Dec. 30, 2025\n\nTerry Lane\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:22 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGC=F\n\nSI=F\n\n^DJI\n\nBTC-USD\n\nStock futures are little changed this morning after two consecutive sessions of losses for major indexes; tech stocks have stabilized after slumping on Monday; gold and silver prices are surging after the precious metals posted steep declines to start the week; Facebook-parent Meta announced it acquired AI agent firm Manus. Here's what investors need to know today.\n\nStock Futures Steady After Two Days of Losses Stock futures are holding steady this morning after major indexes lost ground on Monday for the second straight session. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were hovering near unchanged in recent trading. Bitcoin was at $87,900, up from an overnight low of around $87,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences mortgage rates and costs on other consumer loans, was at 4.14%, up from 4.12% at yesterday's close. Oil prices continued to climb amid tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up 0.3% at $58.30 per barrel, trading near their highest levels of the month.\n\nMajor Tech Stocks Stabilize After Rocky Start to Week Shares of some of the world's biggest technology companies are back on firmer footing Tuesday after leading the market's downturn yesterday.Concerns about whether major tech companies will profit from massive investments in artificial intelligence have weighed on investor sentiment in recent months. In premarket trading Tuesday, Tesla ( TSLA ) shares were up 0.5%, after the stock fell 3.3% on Monday to lead Nasdaq decliners. Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia ( NVDA ) inched higher after shedding more than 1% yesterday, while Palantir ( PLTR ) ticked higher after dropping more than 2% Monday and Oracle ( ORCL ) was little changed after sliding 1%.\n\nGold and Silver Prices Surge After Monday Sell-Off Gold and silver prices are bouncing back from the big declines posted yesterday after exchange operator CME Group made a key change to its metals contracts. Gold futures were recently up 1.7% at $4,415 an ounce, after sliding as low as $4,330 yesterday. Silver futures were up more than 7% this morning, at around $75.55 an ounce. After a weeks-long rally that had lifted the precious metals to a series of record highs, gold and silver plunged on Monday after CME raised its margin requirements for precious metals contracts. Higher margin requirements require traders to add money to accounts that insure against default, effectively raising their costs to trade the futures contracts.\n\nMinutes from Latest Fed Meeting Set for Release Traders will be watching today’s release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting for clues about the direction the Federal Reserve will take on interest rates in 2026. The minutes, which are set to be released at 2 p.m. ET, will provide more insight into the FOMC’s decision to cut the Fed's benchmark lending rate for a third straight meeting . The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady when it meets in January, though rising unemployment levels, along with tame inflation readings, could put pressure on FOMC members to reduce borrowing costs again. Investors will also be monitoring home price data set to be released at 9 a.m. ET.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Acquires AI Agent Firm Manus Meta Platforms ( META ) announced it acquired Manus, a Singapore-based firm that develops autonomous general-purpose AI agents. In a release, Meta said that Manus agents are able to “independently execute complex tasks like market research, coding, and data analysis.” Meta said it would integrate Manus services into its offerings. The move by the Facebook parent company comes as it continues to make big investments in its AI business . Shares of Meta, which through Monday's close were up 13% in 2025, were little changed in premarket trading.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

( NASDAQ:META ) has agreed to acquire Manus, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, as it looks to build more immediate commercial returns from its expanding AI investments. The transaction values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, and was finalized in roughly 10 days. Meta said it plans to continue operating and selling the Manus service while integrating it into its own products, marking a rare US acquisition of an Asian technology company and another major AI commitment under Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nIs META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nManus has been backed by investors including Tencent Holdings, ZhenFund and HSG, and gained attention earlier this year after the debut of DeepSeek. The AI agent had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year, generated through subscription sales to businesses, which could provide Meta with a faster path to monetization than longer-dated AI research efforts. The agent can perform general tasks such as screening resumes, creating travel itineraries and analyzing stocks based on simple instructions. Its parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before relocating to Singapore and raised funding earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in a round led by Benchmark.\n\nThe acquisition comes as AI agents are increasingly promoted by enterprise software companies as tools that operate without constant human supervision, an approach that differs from traditional chatbots. Meta already offers Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and its AI glasses, and is acquiring both the technology and leadership team from Manus, though it has not disclosed where the group will sit internally. The deal lands amid heightened investor debate over Meta's aggressive AI spending, political scrutiny in the US over investment in China-linked AI firms, and limited public comment from Chinese officials, who referred questions to regulatory agencies without further detail.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta's 2025 Reality Check: Three Moves That Redefined Its AI Trajectory\n\nLawrence Nga, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms has traded near-term margins for long-term control of AI.\nIts open-source software could be the answer to building an AI ecosystem.\nMeta rebuilt its AI organization to prioritize execution over experimentation.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n2025 wasn't a year of incremental progress for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . It was a year of commitment. While much of the tech industry debated how quickly to move forward with artificial intelligence, Meta chose a clear path: spend heavily now, accept near-term pressure, and build long-term control.\n\nMeta didn't try to win headlines with a single breakthrough product. Instead, it laid foundations across infrastructure, software, and organization. If AI truly becomes the next computing platform, 2025 may be the year Meta positions itself as an infrastructure business, not just an app company riding the wave.\nHere are the three moves that mattered most this past year.\nMeta prioritized long-term AI control over short-term margin Meta's most controversial decision in 2025 was also its most revealing: committing roughly $60–65 billion in capital , primarily toward AI compute and data centers. That level of spending unsettled some investors, especially those who had grown accustomed to Meta's post-2022 cost discipline.\nBut this wasn't reckless expansion. It was a calculated bet to gain long-term competitive advantage in this area. The bottlenecks in AI development increasingly center around compute -- specifically, who has access to it, who can afford it, and who can iterate the fastest. By scaling one of the world's largest GPU fleets and investing in AI-optimized data centers, Meta aims to remove that bottleneck internally.\n\nFor investors, the key insight is this: Meta stopped optimizing for quarterly optics and started optimizing for strategic independence. As Amazon did with AWS in the early 2010s, Meta chose to absorb upfront costs to secure a durable advantage. If AI economics increasingly favor scale, Meta wants to sit on the right side of that curve.\nLLaMA turned Meta into a player in the AI ecosystem If infrastructure was Meta's physical foundation in 2025, LLaMA was its software wedge. While competitors like OpenAI continued to push closed, API-driven models, Meta has doubled down on open source. With the rolloutof LLaMA 4, the company showed that open-source models can compete near the frontier, while remaining more efficient to deploy and customize.\n\nThe real significance wasn't raw benchmark performance. It was adoption. By making LLaMA freely available, Meta encouraged start-ups, researchers, and enterprises to build on its models. That shifted much of the deployment cost outward, while pulling developers into Meta's orbit. Over time, that creates a powerful network effect: frameworks, tools, and optimizations increasingly standardize around Meta's models.\n\nStory Continues\nThis approach echoes Android's rise in the mobile market. Android didn't need to out-monetize iOS directly. It won by becoming the default layer on which others built. Meta is attempting a similar play in AI by positioning LLaMA not as a consumer product competing with ChatGPT but as AI infrastructure for everyone else.\n\nMeta rebuilt its AI organization around speed and execution The third defining shift of 2025 was internal. Meta reorganized its AI efforts under a new structure, forming Superintelligence Labs and bringing in Alexandr Wang to lead the push toward more capable reasoning systems. At the same time, the company trimmed and reshuffled parts of its AI organization, signaling a move away from sprawl and toward execution.\n\nThis mattered because Meta's challenge was never a lack of research talent. It was translating research into products quickly and consistently. In 2025, management made it clear that success would be measured not by papers or demos, but by how quickly intelligence is reflected in real user experiences.\nThat focus aligns with Meta's most significant advantage: scale. With billions of users across its apps, Meta can deploy AI features, gather feedback, and iterate faster than almost any competitor. Rebuilding the organization around that loop -- build, ship, learn -- was a necessary step.\nFor investors, this shift suggests a disciplined approach. Meta isn't trying to win the AI race by hiring endlessly or chasing abstract goals. It's trying to win by shipping faster than peers at a massive scale.\n\nFor Meta, the payoff doesn't need to show up as LLaMA revenue. It appears when better models enhance ad targeting, content ranking, creator tools, and messaging experiences across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Open source, in this context, isn't altruism--it's leverage.\nWhat does it mean for investors? Taken together, Meta's 2025 decisions tell a coherent story. The company chose to spend heavily on compute, open its models to the world, and restructure its AI organization around speed. None of these moves guarantees success on its own. But together, they significantly raise Meta's odds.\nIf AI becomes the backbone of future digital experiences, Meta has positioned itself not only as a participant but also as an infrastructure provider. For long-term investors, that shift matters far more than any single quarter's margin.\n\nThe real question now isn't what Meta built in 2025 -- it's how effectively it converts that foundation into durable results in the years ahead. All eyes are on the company's execution in the coming quarters.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "AI Trade’s Next Leg Is All About Tech’s ‘Pick-and-Shovel’ Stocks\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBTC-USD\n\nVRT\n\nSNDK\n\nAPH\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The artificial intelligence trade is moving, and investors seeking cutting-edge ways to play it are snapping up technology “pick-and-shovel” stocks as massive cloud service providers pour billions into new data centers.\nData storage companies dominated the S&P 500 Index in 2025, with Sandisk Corp. shares soaring almost 580% to make them the benchmark’s best performer, with Western Digital Corp. in second and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc in fourth. Meanwhile, AI-linked power providers and cable and fiber producers such as Amphenol Corp., Corning Inc., NRG Energy Inc. and GE Vernova Inc. were among the Top 25.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nThat’s a shift from the last few years, when Nvidia Corp. — the original AI pick-and-shovel company — was entrenched among the top stocks in the S&P 500. The chip giant gained 40% in 2025, making it the 71st best performer in the index this year. While Nvidia and cloud hyperscalers Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are still powering the market due to their sheer size, their percentage gains have started to wane.\n“When the benchmarks are fairly concentrated, it’s important to look for themes that are gonna drive sales and earnings growth,” said Jake Seltz, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “AI is kind of one of those dominant themes right now, that’s nothing new. So we’re just looking, broadening our horizons beyond tech.”\n\nInvestors can find room to grow and better valuations by buying into the next wave of companies that are set to benefit from the billions of dollars hyperscalers are spending to build data centers.\n“What we are focused on are the picks and shovels of where that money is being spent,” said Matt Sallee, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which doesn’t own shares of any hyperscalers. “The chips to a degree, but more so some of the names that you haven’t really heard of.”\nOf course, there are some fears on Wall Street that the spending could slow, reversing gains in stocks tied to AI. It’s similar to what happened during the pandemic, when demand for basic home health products took off.\n“Covid hit and this world needed way more face masks, hand sanitizer, all those things,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management. But within six to 12 months there was a glut, and “those businesses that supplied those things went from the best times ever to the absolute worst times ever.”\nStill, investors remain bullish on the AI trade as the hyperscalers keep pledging to spend. Here’s what investors are buying now to play the tech infrastructure buildout.\n\nStory continues\nData Storage\nWall Street expects data storage to remain hot in 2026 after Sandisk, Western Digital and Seagate surged in 2025. However, the boom times for this year’s winners may be coming to an end. For example, the average analyst price target for Sandisk in 2026 is $264, which would be a roughly 8% gain from where it currently sits at around $244.\n\nAnalysts see much bigger upside in a company like Pure Storage Inc., which is trading for $68 but is projected to reach $94 in 2026, a 38% leap. Other digital storage shares tied to AI include NetApp Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc.\nConstruction and Power\nA range of stocks associated with building and powering data centers are expected to keep running. Quanta Services Inc., which provides specialized contracting for utilities and telecommunications companies, is a top pick for Tortoise Capital’s Sallee. Other contractors include MYR Group Inc., Primoris Services Corp. and MasTec Inc.\nCompanies involved in wiring are also popular. They include Amphenol, which designs and manufactures high-speed fiber and copper interconnect solutions used in data centers, and Emcor Group Inc., which does mechanical and electrical construction. Other power infrastructure names include Vistra Corp., Constellation Energy Corp., GE Vernova and Generac Holdings Inc., which makes backup generators.\n\nBitcoin Miners\nBitcoin miners represent a potential “total revaluation story” as they pivot toward powering data centers and away from mining the cryptocurrency, according to Sallee.\n“They have the electricity already, they’ve had it for five-plus years to produce Bitcoin,” he said. “They’re going to redirect that electricity to higher-value, long-term contracts for high performance computing hosting.”\nNames in this area include Bitdeer Technologies Group, whose shares jumped in October after the company announced plans to move further into AI. Shares of IREN Ltd., Cipher Mining Inc., Riot Platforms Inc. and WhiteFiber Inc. have also received a boost from the companies’ intentions to convert to high-performance computing data centers.\nHeating and Cooling\n\nData centers require specialized precision controlled heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, creating demand for the companies that make them. Vertiv Holdings Co., which provides power systems and cooling solutions for data centers, is up 46% in 2025 and remains a stock to watch. Eaton Corp., another power management firm, overlaps with Vertiv but is less of a pure play, according to Seltz.\nOther names in the space include Comfort Systems USA Inc., which provides heating ventilation and air conditioning system installation and maintenance, as well as water providers Xylem Inc., Ecolab Inc. and American Water Works Co.\nSoftware\nSome investors with longer time horizons are looking to software as future beneficiaries of AI as large language models improve and more applications are built.\n\n“Investors are, I think, naturally inclined to look for companies that have cheaper valuations with terrific magnitude of growth that are potentially gonna really benefit from the application of AI,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha.\nSoftware stocks have generally underperformed this year, with the S&P 500 Software Industry Index rising 12% in 2025 compared with a 17% gain in the overall benchmark. But that has made the stocks’ valuations more appealing.\n“I don’t think those stories are dead,” said Allspring’s Seltz, who is watching names such as Snowflake Inc., Datadog Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. “It feels like it might be a little early, but the stocks do look attractive.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Meta to Acquire Manus in $2 Billion Bet on AI Agents\n\nKurt Wagner, Luz Ding and Lulu Yilun Chen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:18 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTCEHY\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has agreed to buy Manus, a popular Singapore-based artificial intelligence agent with Chinese roots, in its effort to build a business around its massive AI investment.\nThe deal values Manus at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a rare US acquisition of an Asian tech company and the latest multibillion-dollar AI bet from Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The agreement was struck in about 10 days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are not public.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nMeta intends to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating it into its products, it said in a statement. Backed by some of China’s biggest names like Tencent Holdings Ltd., ZhenFund and HSG, Manus shot to prominence early this year not long after DeepSeek’s debut. All of its existing investors have been bought out in Meta’s takeover, one of the people said.\n“There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson said. Manus' parent company, Butterfly Effect Pte, was founded in China before moving to Singapore.\n\nZuckerberg has made AI his company’s top priority, and is spending billions to hire researchers, build data centers and develop new models. Manus had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year from selling its AI agent to businesses via subscriptions, which could give Meta a more immediate return on some of its AI spending\nThe Manus AI agent can complete a handful of general tasks, such as screening resumes, creating trip itineraries and analyzing stocks in response to basic instructions. Butterfly Effect raised money earlier this year at close to a $500 million valuation in an investment round led by US venture capital firm Benchmark.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nMeta's purchase of Manus is likely aimed at expanding the former's AI agent task capabilities, as it currently lacks applications built on its own foundation model compared to a broader application ecosystem for ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. While the deal marks an early step for Meta to build a subscription and API business around its AI investment, it could draw regulatory scrutiny given that Singapore-based Manus was founded in China.\n\nStory Continues\n— Mandeep Singh and Robert Biggar, BI analysts\nAI agents are tools that don’t need human supervision to perform specific digital tasks. Enterprise software companies such as Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. have heavily promoted their versions of agents as the most effective way for businesses to use the emerging technology, rather than generative AI features such as chatbots, which require user prompts and interaction.\n\nMeta already has an AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available through the company’s social media and messaging platforms — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — in addition to its AI glasses. The US company is acquiring the technology and leadership group from Manus, though its statement didn’t detail where the new team will sit within the organization. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the deal’s value, said Manus co-founder and CEO Xiao Hong will report to Javier Olivan, chief operating officer of Meta, citing people familiar with the acquisition.\nAlexandr Wang, Meta’s Chief AI Officer who joined this summer as part of a high-profile investment into his startup, welcomed the Manus team of about 100 staff with a post on X. In his own message on the platform, Manus’ Xiao said that the deal would help his company expand the reach of its agents. “The era of AI that doesn’t just talk, but acts, creates, and delivers, is only beginning,” he wrote. “And now, we get to build it at a scale we never could have imagined.”\n\nMeta’s aggressive spending to compete in the AI race is matched by rivals like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. Zuckerberg has pledged to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure projects over the next three years, many of them expected to be AI-related. The company has hired an expensive team of researchers to develop a new state-of-the-art AI model it plans to debut next spring, and has faced some skepticism from investors who worry that the heavy spending won’t result in meaningful revenue anytime soon.\nVC firm Benchmark was criticized earlier this year by lawmakers and other venture investors for backing an AI company with ties to China. “Who thinks it is a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me,” US Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, wrote in a post on X in May. Benchmark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Meta deal Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the deal during a regular press briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday referred reporters to relevant regulatory agencies without elaborating.\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Philip Glamann.\n(Updates with Meta comment in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.\nBuy the \"Mag 7\" Hyperscalers Or Are They Spending Too Much?\nAlthough they are among the world&rsquo;s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\n\nThis includes Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\nThere is no doubt that &ldquo;hyperscaling&rdquo; is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns\nNotably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billio\nROIC Comparison\nWith Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market&rsquo;s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\n\nAmazon&rsquo;s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance\nMagnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon&rsquo;s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon&rsquo;s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts\nAmazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Meta just bought Manus, an AI startup everyone has been talking about\n\nConnie Loizos\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:39 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nTCEHY\n\nMark Zuckerberg has struck again.\nMeta Platforms is acquiring Manus, a Singapore-based AI startup that’s become the talk of Silicon Valley since it materialized this spring with a demo video so slick it went instantly viral. The clip showed an AI agent that could do things like screen job candidates, plan vacations, and analyze stock portfolios. Manus claimed at the time that it outperformed OpenAI’s Deep Research.\n\nBy April, just weeks after launch, the early-stage firm Benchmark led a $75 million funding round that assigned Manus a post-money valuation of $500 million. General partner Chetan Puttagunta joined the board. Per Chinese media outlets , some other big-name backers had already invested in Manus at that point, including Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly known as Sequoia China) via an earlier $10 million round.\nThough Bloomberg raised questions when Manus started charging $39 or $199 a month for access to its AI models (the outlet noted the pricing seemed “ somewhat aggressive . . . for a membership service still in a testing phase,”) the company recently announced it had since signed up millions of users and crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nThat’s when Meta started negotiating with Manus, according to the WSJ , which says Meta is paying $2 billion — the same valuation Manus was seeking for its next funding round.\nFor Zuckerberg, who has staked Meta’s future on AI, Manus represents something new: an AI product that’s actually making money (investors have grown increasingly twitchy about Meta’s $60 billion infrastructure spending spree).\nMeta says it’ll keep Manus running independently while weaving its agents into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, where Meta’s own chatbot, Meta AI, is already available to users.\nThere is one wrinkle, however, which is that Manus, which launched eight months ago, has Chinese founders who founded parent company Butterfly Effect in Beijing in 2022 before decamping to Singapore in the middle of this year. Whether that raises flags in Washington remains to be seen, but Senator John Cornyn already dragged Benchmark for its investment in the company, asking back in May on X who thought it was “a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me.”\n\nCornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has long been one of Congress’s most vocal hawks on China and technology competition, but he’s hardly alone. Being tough on China has become one of the genuinely bipartisan issues in Congress.\nUnsurprisingly, Meta has already told Nikkei Asia that after the acquisition, Manus won’t have any ties to Chinese investors and will no longer operate in China. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson told the outlet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

A day later Sebastian appeared on a CNBC Television interview to discuss his outlook on the stock.\n\nThe rating comes at a time when Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has decreased more than 10.13% over the past 6 months. Sebastian noted that the firm acknowledges the concerns regarding the company’s margins and investments are legitimate. However, he highlighted that the firm is advising investors to look ahead, given the importance of the AI theme and the critical position the company holds in the industry.\nHe added that the company is expected to launch AI products by leveraging all the investment and hiring it has done in the past 2 years. Sebastian highlighted the launch of the next Llama model, updates to Meta AI, and monetization of WhatsApp and Threads as key catalysts for the company’s upcoming growth. He notes that these steps would enable the company to sustain a healthy growth rate.\n\nSebastian also believes that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a fantastic advertising model. He added that Google and Meta have accounted for around 80% of the industry growth in 2025, suggesting the efficiency of their model. The analyst highlighted the huge gap between the monetization at Meta and Google, suggesting a huge upside potential and room for growth for Meta.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is focused on developing AI-powered social platforms and immersive technologies, including Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Why This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is 1 of My Top Dividend Stock Ideas for 2026 and Beyond\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:51 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nKey Points Meta's dividend is minuscule relative to the company's profits, leaving significant room for growth over time.\nThe social media specialist also returns capital to shareholders through significant share repurchases.\nThe business is growing rapidly, providing another layer of support for dividend growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nWhen most investors think about the \"Magnificent Seven,\" they're typically thinking about growth -- not income. But the truth is that a few of these companies now generate so much cash that they can invest aggressively and still send capital back to shareholders.\nCase in point: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . Though the company's dividend is still young, with the first payments to shareholders starting last year, it's one of my favorite dividend ideas for 2026 and beyond. Not only can the social media company easily afford its dividend, but it also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases . Best of all, the underlying business has seen explosive growth recently.\nSure, the stock may not be a good fit for someone who needs significant income from their investments. At Meta's current quarterly dividend of $0.525 per share, the annualized payout is $2.10, which works out to a dividend yield of just 0.3%. But what makes Meta interesting is the runway for dividend growth, not just the current yield.\nA payout ratio that leaves wiggle room A good dividend is only as strong as the company's ability to keep paying it. One way to gauge that is the payout ratio, or the percent of earnings the company is paying out in dividends.\nMeta's payout ratio is extremely low, at just 9%.\nThis means there's significant room in the coming years for dividend increases. Of course, shareholders likely don't want to see Meta's payout ratio rise meaningfully anytime soon, as the company has a lot of growth opportunities to invest in -- namely AI (artificial intelligence) data centers. In fact, the company expects to spend $70 to $72 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 alone, largely driven by investments in AI computing infrastructure.\n\nBig share repurchases While Meta's dividend yield is low, the company's total shareholder yield has been meaningful when including share repurchases (an indirect way to return capital to shareholders by reducing a company's total share count).\nIn Q3, Meta returned about $1.3 billion in dividends, and it spent almost $3.2 billion repurchasing its shares. In Q2, Meta spent nearly $10 billion repurchasing its shares.\n\nStory Continues\nRapid business growth Of course, the best part of Meta's dividend growth story is the company's strong underlying business growth.\nIts third-quarter revenue rose 26% year over year to about $51.2 billion -- an acceleration from the 22% year-over-year revenue growth Meta posted in Q2. Fueling its third-quarter growth was a 14% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and 10% growth in average price per ad.\n\nFree cash flow is also worth watching for dividend investors because it reflects how much cash is left after capital spending but before dividend payments and share repurchases. Meta reported about $10.6 billion of free cash flow in Q3.\nAn important caveat With all of this said, it's possible that Meta will put dividend growth on hold temporarily, or at least turn to only modest dividend hikes.\nThis is because Meta is investing heavily in AI.\n\"I think that it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load building capacity so that way we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the company's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nIn addition to guiding for $70 billion to $72 billion in 2025 capital expenditures, management said capital expenditures dollar growth is expected to be notably larger in 2026 than in 2025.\nThat spending could cap how fast the dividend can grow in the near term.\nFinally, it's worth noting that while Meta stock isn't necessarily expensive, it's not cheap either. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29 as of this writing. This makes it important that Meta continues growing rapidly -- and that its aggressive investments in AI pay off handsomely.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Holds $87k As Asia Rally Stalls, Wall Street Tech Slips A Nansen analyst says Bitcoin and Ethereum have traded sideways as year-end seasonality slows volumes rather than signaling a shift in market structure.\n\nShalini Nagarajan\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:28 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\n^NDX\n\n^GSPC\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nBitcoin held near $87,000 on Tuesday, setting a steady tone for crypto as Asian equities took a breather after a seven-day run and investors marked down US tech stocks into year-end.\nMSCI’s gauge of Asia Pacific shares slipped 0.1% in early trading, and S&#038;P 500 futures edged lower after the US benchmark fell 0.3% on Monday.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.5% in that session, with Tesla, Nvidia and Meta among the notable decliners.\nThe softer equity tape arrived alongside another bout of metal volatility. Silver and gold swung after a sharp pullback from fresh all-time highs, as traders booked profits and liquidity thinned after the holidays.\nCrypto traders kept describing the same theme, a market that keeps moving, then does it with less depth.\nMarket snapshot Bitcoin : $87,164, down 1.9%\nEther : $2,929, down 2.3%\nXRP: $1.85, down 2.2%\nTotal crypto market cap: $3.03 trillion, down 2.1%\nBitcoin And Ether Drift Sideways As Year-End Volumes Fade Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, said year-end trading has slowed and volumes have faded across major assets. “Bitcoin and Ethereum have both traded largely sideways over the past week, reflecting seasonal inactivity rather than a meaningful shift in market structure,” he said.\n“Activity has cooled across most chains, with a broad consolidation in active addresses, transactions, and fees generated over the past 30 days. Chains like Base saw notable pullbacks in DEX volumes following a very strong run earlier in the year. Solana remains the dominant venue for onchain trading by volume, even as user activity softened slightly over the week, with BNB Chain a distant second.”\n\n“Overall, trading activity hasn’t disappeared; it has simply slowed and become more selective as the year comes to a close.”\nProfit-Taking Hits Metals After New Highs Macro investors, meanwhile, stayed focused on the policy path. Investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes due later Tuesday, a release that often resets rate expectations when positioning runs crowded.\nThe bigger picture still shows a strong year for risk assets, despite the late-year wobbles. The MSCI All Country World Index has climbed about 21% in 2025, and a broad measure of Asian stocks has rallied almost 26%, according to market-wrap data.\n\nIn metals, the latest move showed how quickly crowded trades can unwind. Spot silver fell 4.8% on Monday after earlier hitting a record, and gold eased after setting its own peak on Friday, with profit-taking doing the heavy lifting.\nFor crypto, Bitcoin’s steadiness looked more like a positioning pause than a conviction push, with traders watching liquidity, flows and volatility pricing for the next move into the first week of 2026.\nRead original story Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Holds $87k As Asia Rally Stalls, Wall Street Tech Slips by Shalini Nagarajan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tech Stocks Aren't Always The Answer\n\nDerek Lewis\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIf there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s undoubtedly true over the past decade, it&rsquo;s that technology stocks have been blistering hot.\nAnd it&rsquo;s been for very understandable reasons &ndash; many of these companies&rsquo; products have entirely changed the way the world behaves. People stay solely connected through digital channels such as social media, students are now taking their exams online, and consumers are even utilizing digital apps that allow for grocery delivery.\n\nBut while all that sounds fun and exciting, many have overlooked simple businesses that aren&rsquo;t overly flashy. This includes companies that take care of waste management, provide staffing uniforms, and even energy drink providers, to give a few examples.\nMany of these companies fall into the Consumer Staples sector, whose businesses face steady demand across many economic conditions. In other words, people will want their trash picked up no matter the state of the economy, and we all obviously enjoy our caffeine buzz.\nAnd perhaps to the surprise of some, these non-technology companies have seen wildly strong performance, with their lower beta nature providing nice shields against volatility.\nCintas Outperforms Meta For example, Cintas CTAS, the company responsible for providing staffing uniforms and other relevant materials to employers, has gained +830% over the last decade, which compares to a +530% gain from high-flying Meta Platforms META. Cintas&rsquo; 25% annualized return over the period even outpaces the S&P 500&rsquo;s +15.3% annualized return over the same period.\n\nAnd maybe even more shockingly, Cintas shares have nearly kept pace with even Microsoft over the last decade, with MSFT shares up +900% compared to Cintas&rsquo; +830% gain. While these investments are typically labeled as &lsquo;boring,&rsquo; their stability is undeniable.\nSimply put, you don&rsquo;t have to buy tech stocks to see great returns. Lesser-discussed companies like Cintas have built consistent, dependable growth by doing the &lsquo;simple&rsquo; things exceptionally well. Of course, they&rsquo;re likely not to impress investors given their less-flashy nature, but sometimes boring is better.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Meta acquires Manus to expand AI agent capabilities\n\nLuke Juricic\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nInvesting.com -- Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has acquired Manus, a leading autonomous general-purpose AI agent company, in a move to integrate advanced agent technology across its products. Financial terms of the deal were not announced.\nManus, which launched its first General AI Agent earlier this year, has already processed more than 147 trillion tokens and created over 80 million virtual computers. The company currently serves millions of users and businesses worldwide.\n\n\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" said Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus.\nMeta plans to continue operating and selling the Manus service while also integrating it into Meta’s product ecosystem, including Meta AI. The acquisition will bring Manus’s technology to Meta’s billions of users and millions of businesses.\nThe Singapore-based Manus has experienced rapid growth, recently announcing it had reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue just eight months after launch, making it reportedly the fastest startup to achieve this milestone globally. The company’s total revenue run rate exceeds $125 million, including usage-based and other revenue.\n\nThis acquisition comes during what has been described as an intense year for Meta, involving an AI overhaul under CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company has been restructuring to regain ground in the AI race while reportedly developing new AI models like Mango and Avocado for 2026.\nEarlier in 2025, Meta formed Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a dedicated division headquartered in Menlo Park, California, focused on building advanced AI models that integrate deeply into Meta’s ecosystem. The division is lead by Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, a data-labelling startup Meta bought a 49% stake in for $14 billion, effectively acquiring Wang’s services.\nManus will continue to operate from Singapore following the acquisition.\nMeta has not yet responded to Investing.com’s request for comment.\nRelated articles\nMeta acquires Manus to expand AI agent capabilities\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Buy Stock in the Mag 7 Hyperscalers or Are They Spending Too Much?\n\nShaun Pruitt\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAlthough they are among the world’s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\nThis includes Amazon AMZN , Alphabet GOOGL , Meta Platforms META , and Microsoft MSFT , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\n\nThere is no doubt that “hyperscaling” is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns Notably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billion.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nROIC Comparison With Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market’s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\nAmazon’s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance Magnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon’s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon’s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\n\nStory Continues\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts Amazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500’s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Down 40%, This Growth Stock Could Be Set for a Recovery in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:20 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points Shares of Oracle are down big from the all-time high they reached in August.\nOracle's AI spending could be viewed as reckless or a bold bet worth taking.\nOptimists about Oracle's new direction should view the stock as attractive.\n10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›\nShares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) , the database and cloud computing specialist, have kept pace with the S&P 500 in 2025 -- up 17% year to date at the time of this writing, compared to a 17.5% gain in the index. But the tech giant's stock is down about 40% from its all-time high (made in August of this year).\n\nIn hindsight, Oracle's stock probably ran up too far, too fast in a short period, driven by exuberance for its cloud computing deals with OpenAI , Meta Platforms , and other notable companies. But the sell-off is overblown.\nHere's what investors are getting wrong about Oracle and why the stock is a great buy for 2026.\nOracle's divisive transformation Financial markets often struggle to price companies undergoing a transformation. After all, investor expectations stem from what a company does and what it is expected to do in the coming years. And if a company is doing something completely different, there's more uncertainty, which can lead to volatility.\n\nEnter Oracle, a legacy database services company looking to become a cloud computing titan with the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet 's owned Google Cloud.\nOracle's legacy software business is a stable cash cow. But Oracle doesn't generate nearly enough cash flow to cover the massive capital expenditures (capex) needed for building AI infrastructure. So it has turned to the debt markets to fund its massive expansion, which is needed to fulfill $523 billion of remaining performance obligations (RPO).\nThe capex-to-revenue metric shows the relative size of a company's spending within the context of its revenue. Just a few years ago, the major hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon had roughly 0.1 to 0.15 capex-to-revenue ratios, meaning they were raking in around 7 to 10 times more revenue than they were spending on capex. Those ratios have increased as hyperscalers ramp up their spending on artificial intelligence (AI). But Oracle is on another level -- with a capex-to-revenue ratio at a sky-high 0.58.\nOracle is spending so much on AI that its free cash flow (FCF) has turned negative. And that has a lot of investors worried that Oracle is taking an unnecessary gamble on AI. Oracle's credit risk has increased, and it could face a downgrade by ratings agencies to the lower bound of investment grade or possibly even just outside investment grade.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Oracle did mention multiple times on its Dec. 10 earnings call that it is committed to maintaining its investment-grade rating. These fears are arguably already reflected in the stock price. And investors are overlooking the most critical detail about Oracle's debt load: the timeline.\nAn end in sight for Oracle's cash burn Oracle is now more than halfway through building 72 multicloud data centers that embed its database services into third-party clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle expects Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue to ramp up substantially in fiscal 2028, which overlaps with calendar year 2027, as the bulk of its data centers will come online. This is also the time period when Oracle's five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI begins.\nOracle Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Ken Bond said the following when discussing Oracle's negative $10 billion in second-quarter fiscal 2026 FCF on its Dec. 10 earnings call:\nIn sum, Oracle is in the midst of a temporary boom in capex that should soon translate to FCF. It's not a company in a burgeoning industry bleeding cash in the hopes that it can turn profitable down the line.\nTherefore, the biggest risk to Oracle isn't necessarily its debt load or the timeline for converting capex to FCF to pay off debt, but rather, if its customers actually come through on their commitments to pay for OCI services.\n\nOpenAI's $300 billion deal is massive, even within the context of Oracle's $523 billion in RPO. However, even if OpenAI retracts some of that commitment or spreads it out over a longer period, I still believe Oracle will have no shortage of customers to redirect that capacity.\nOracle is a top AI growth stock to buy in the new year Oracle's stock price could be volatile until it proves to investors that it can convert AI capex into FCF. Right now, OpenAI is playing a major role in that narrative because it is potentially Oracle's largest customer. But Oracle doesn't need OpenAI to succeed.\nOracle's data centers are purpose-built for high-performance computing. Its multicloud data centers reduce latency and costs and boost performance by embedding database services within third-party clouds rather than moving large data sets across clouds. So, OCI can be more cost-effective and achieve better performance than its peers.\n\nWith that advantage in mind, it stands to reason that Oracle should be able to win business from other hyperscalers, possibly even OpenAI's top competitors, such as Anthropic, the company behind the Claude AI assistant and large language models.\nWith Oracle stock trading at a26.6 forward price-to-earnings ratio, the market seems to have already digested Oracle's risks, but it is downplaying its potential -- especially the speed at which Oracle could begin paying down debt with FCF. All told, Oracle stands out as a high-conviction growth stock to buy for 2026, but only for risk-tolerant investors who can withstand high volatility.\nShould you buy stock in Oracle right now?

      "Content": "Creator Capital Markets: How Pump.fun Changed Streaming in 2025\n\nRyan Gladwin\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:01 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: PUMP36507-USD\n\nSOL-USD\n\nMETA\n\nThis time last year, the Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun had disabled its livestreaming feature after creators flooded the platform with videos of dangerous stunts in attempts to pump their tokens.\nNow, Pump.fun views streamers as the future of its platform, with plans to take on other livestreaming competitors head on: “Our plan is to kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana,” the company posted on X in July.\n\nThe move is being billed as “ creator capital markets ”—the idea that viewers can help fund their favorite creators while having a stake in the future of their content via a crypto token. It’s a stark contrast from the traditional model, which mostly relies on viewers donating money to creators, with little to nothing in return.\nPump.fun turbocharged this vision when it revamped its fee structure in September to feed more of the fees it generates from each trade to token creators’ pockets. This resulted in some streamers earning tens of thousands of dollars over just a couple days as their content went viral.\nBut the initial momentum soon crashed back down to reality as it became clear that creators and traders made the most money when they leaned into crazy stunts. And Pump.fun found itself back where it started, with a model that incentivizes creators to walk the line of controversy. Now the industry is reflecting on how to change that.\n\nLivestreams return On April 4 , Pump.fun rolled out its updated streaming feature to 5% of its users with revamped user guidelines and a bolstered moderation system. It then slowly expanded the feature to more users, making sure it didn’t get out of control as it did in 2024.\nTwo months later, crypto influencer Jake “ SolJakey ” Hillhouse launched Basedd House , a content crew full of up-and-coming influencers living together in a frat-like house with weekly episodes and meme coins attached to each character. It’s from this that now-established creators made their name, like the wacky Iseem and crypto rapper Whish . Pump.fun directly funded the whole venture, Hillhouse previously told Decrypt .\n\nOther creators and viral moments started to bubble up around them in June, too.\nLeland King Fawcette became the second-fastest person to race through all 50 U.S. states , according to Fifty States Club , all while livestreaming on Pump.fun. A Ukrainian man called Ricken said the words “Pump fun” one million times on stream. And one man even livestreamed the birth of his child , and then named her “Solana”—after the crypto network that hosts the meme coin machine.\nIt was clear that Pump.fun had tapped into something with its audience, and it was then that the company began investing in what it now saw as the future of the platform.\n\nStory Continues\nPump.fun invests Pump.fun started paying people to post clips of the launchpad’s top creators, the opposite of traditional livestreaming platforms, which require their creators to source, manage, and pay these “clippers.” Pump.fun co-founder Alon Cohen told Decrypt this was a bet on “stimulating social activity” in the hopes of incentivizing more adoption of crypto-native livestreaming.\n\nBut it was in September, when Pump.fun revamped its fee model to increase the earnings of creators on the platform tenfold, that streaming started to explode. On one day in September, Pump.fun handed out over $4 million in creator fees, according to Dune data. This meant that streamers, who create their own meme coins attached to each viral (they hope) event, no longer had to sell their own supply of these tokens to make good money.\nPump.fun then doubled down on its livestreaming bet. It began shipping out streamer backpack kits to help creators boost the quality of their streams. The launchpad also hired an unknown number of recruiters, who helped Pump.fun offer contracts to traditional content creators.\nAlec Strasmore , a former assistant to musician Post Malone , was one of these recruiters. Stasmore told Decrypt in September that he would approach content creators in the traditional space who had big audiences but were struggling to monetize effectively, and introduce them to Pump.fun and help onboard them.\n\nThe exact terms of these streamer contracts remain undisclosed. A source familiar with these deals, however, told Decrypt that the contracts included commitments to streaming time, token supply control, and were usually short-term—weeks and months, rather than years. This helped prompt a stream of well-known influencers outside of crypto to join the platform.\nChad Tepper, a former member of Jake Paul’s influencer crew Team 10, who has millions of followers across social media , was one of those who joined Pump.fun. Others, like retired League of Legends esports player Michael “ BunnyFuFuu ” Kurylo, also joined the platform.\nUsually, these tokens would debut with an immediate surge in price, as the content creators' audience bought into the token. More often than not, though, it didn’t last—the hype would eventually fade and the tokens would then slowly trend downwards.\n\nThese scenarios resulted in streamers making big bags during the first few days of trading (BunnyFuFu made over $130,000 in fees in his first three days), before their fees tapered off as trading volume plummeted. (BunnyFuFu only made $29,000 in the three months following). The short shelf life didn’t just hurt creators—traders and viewers also made less money over time.\nAnd, as a result, many of these traditional streamers and creators have since stopped streaming on Pump.fun.\nFormer Pump.fun Dev Sentenced to Six Years in Prison for $2 Million Solana Fraud\n“A lot of those didn't work out. Maybe the best course of action is to not go spend a shit ton of money on Web2 streamers,” Hillhouse told Decrypt , referring to streamers outside of the crypto or “Web3” space. “But you do get those few that matter, that now become a proof of concept,” he said, pointing to Misfits boxer B Dave and TikTok influencer Minikon as shining examples. Both creators ’ tokens are down over 90% from highs set shortly after launch.\n\n“Moving forward, I don’t think [Pump.fun] should be doing that again,” Hillhouse said, suggesting any future deals need to be “more long-term.”\nVirality matters But Pump.fun’s biggest success stories this year came from its homegrown talent: Hillhouse’s Basedd House, the random degens looking to break world records on the site , and the Bagwork boys.\nIn September, two dudes, Chris and Mike, created a token called Bagwork and then livestreamed various stunts to work those bags. The first stunt was relatively mild, running onto the field during a baseball game. They then went mega viral after filming themselves stealing gym influencer Bradley Martyn’s hat and getting slapped for it. The Bagwork token surged 2,000% as a result, netting the duo $49,000 in fees. All it took was just one viral video.\n\nJust days later, the pair leaked unreleased songs from rapper Drake, which brought the Bagwork brand international recognition—and legal trouble, in the form of an apparent cease and desist notice. This stunt earned the Bagwork boys $83,000 in fees over just two days.\nBut the token fell victim to the same ailment that many meme coins before it suffered: once the attention, hype, and controversy fade, so does the price. Bagwork is currently down 96% from its all-time high market cap of $53.8 million, back during the Drake leaks, and now sits at $1.9 million, according to DEX Screener .\nIn an interview with Decrypt , Mike from Bagwork called that period “the best few days of my life.” He thought he was about to turn into one of the “biggest and richest” streamers in the world. As the attention waned, though, he realized there is “definitely a little bit of an issue” with Pump.fun streamers “needing crazier content to pump their tokens.”\n\nSolana Dev Hospitalized With Third Degree Burns Trying to Pump Meme Coin\nHillhouse agreed that something isn’t right with the current model. He suggested more community activations that require tokens, such as voting on what a creator does on stream.\nPump.fun did not respond to Decrypt ’s request for comment on how the company plans to address this tension.\nIt may be make or break for creator capital markets in the coming year. Will Pump.fun find a way to fix its reliance on sensationalist viral moments? Or will creator capital markets fade into obscurity, like the many meme coin trends before it?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2025 was the year AI got a vibe check\n\nRebecca Bellan\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nSCAI.PVT\n\nMoney was no object for the AI industry in early 2025. A vibe check crept in the second half of the year.\nOpenAI raised $40 billion at a $300 billion valuation. Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machine Labs raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech.\n\nSuch astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta shelled out nearly $15 billion to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending.\nThe first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace.\nThe era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment?\n\nWe’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself.\nHow the year started The biggest AI labs got bigger this year.\nIn 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a Softbank-led $40 billion round at a $300 billion post-money valuation. The company also reportedly has investors like Amazon orbiting with compute-tied circular deals, and is in talks to raise $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation . That would bring OpenAI close to the $1 trillion valuation it is reportedly seeking in an IPO next year.\n\nOpenAI rival Anthropic also closed $16.5 billion this year across two rounds, its most recent raise pushed its valuation to $183 billion with heavy hitters like Iconiq Capital, Fidelity, and the Qatar Investment Authority participating. (CEO Dario Amodei confessed to staff in a leaked memo that he was “not thrilled” about taking money from dictatorial Gulf states).\nThen there’s Elon Musk’s xAI, which raised at least $10 billion this year after acquiring X , the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk also owns.\nWe’ve also seen smaller, new startups get a hypey boost from froth-mouthed investors.\n\nStory Continues\nFormer OpenAI chief technologist Mira Murati’s startup Thinking Machine Labs secured a $2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation despite sharing almost no information about its product offering. Vibe-coding startup Lovable’s $200 million Series A earned it a unicorn horn just eight months after launching; this month, Lovable raised another $330 million at a nearly $7 billion post-money valuation. And we can’t leave out AI recruiting startup Mercor, which raised $450 million this year across two rounds, the latest bringing its valuation up to $10 billion .\n\nThese absurdly large valuations are still happening even against the backdrop of still-modest enterprise adoption figures and serious infrastructure constraints, heightening fears of an AI bubble.\nBuild, baby, build For the larger firms, those numbers aren’t coming from nowhere. Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure.\nThe result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding with Nvidia . In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage.\n\nSome of the biggest deals this year powering the infrastructure boom were:\nBut cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently pulled out of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be.\nWhether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers – including calls from figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders to rein in data center expansion – are already slowing projects in some regions.\nEven as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype.\nThe expectation reset In 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout .\nWhile it was meaningful on paper, it didn’t land with the same punch as earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific.\n\nEven Gemini 3 , which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI – which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous ‘code red’ memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance.\nThere was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of R1, its “reasoning” model that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost.\nFrom model breakthroughs to business models As the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows?\nThat shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to sell them hyper-personalized ads . Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI , a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay.\n\nMore than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own Comet browser with agentic capabilities and paying Snap $400 million to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels.\nOpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own Atlas browser and other consumer-facing features like Pulse , while also courting enterprises and developers by launching apps inside ChatGPT itself.\nGoogle, for its part, is leaning on incumbency . On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like Google Calendar , while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting MCP connectors to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge.\n\nIn a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat.\nThe trust and safety vibe check AI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025. More than 50 copyright lawsuits wound through the courts, while reports of “AI psychosis” – the result of chatbots reinforcing delusions and allegedly contributing to multiple suicides and other life-threatening episodes – sparked calls for trust and safety reforms.\n\nWhile some copyright battles met their end – like Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement to authors – most are still unresolved. Though the conversation appears to be shifting from resistance against using copyrighted content for training, to demands for compensation (See: New York Times sues Perplexity for copyright infringement ).\nMeanwhile, mental health concerns around AI chatbot interactions – and their sycophantic responses – emerged as a serious public health issue following multiple deaths by suicide and life-threatening delusions in teens and adults after prolonged chatbot usage. The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots .\n\nPerhaps most telling: the calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects.\nIndustry leaders have warned against chatbots “ juicing engagement ,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional over-reliance on ChatGPT.\nEven the labs themselves started sounding alarms. Anthropic’s May safety report documented Claude Opus 4 attempting to blackmail engineers to prevent its own shutdown. The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy.\nLooking ahead If 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value.\nThe era of ‘trust us, the returns will come’ is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia.

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nEllie Diamond\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: FIG\n\nSTLA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAAPL\n\nThere are countless articles and profiles of entrepreneurs who dropped out of college. Fortune magazine recently featured several, including Figma CEO Dylan Field and Scale founder Lucy Guo, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire woman, who built her own fortune.\nInnovators like these young people make the news because they’re inspiring, intelligent and innovative. They’re also exceptional. which can make them unrealistic role models, according to Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from experience before striking out on their own.\n\nThe Exception, Not the Rule In October 2025, two entrepreneurs took the stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin. One was John Elkann, the chair and executive director of automaking giant Stellantis [ 3 ]. During his interview with Bezos, Elkann asked what he thought of the ideal of the prodigy entrepreneur.\nThese are personalities such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Steve Jobs. Each became hugely successful after rejecting the conventional pathway to success: a college education and years of climbing the ladder .\n\nElkann didn’t take this route, and neither did Bezos. They have great respect for those who did, but Bezos is quick to point out that it shouldn’t be an expectation.\n“It is possible to be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur ,” he said. “We have famous examples of that. But these people are the exception.”\nThe numbers back him up. A Clifford-Lewis Private Wealth study found that among the top 0.1% of rapidly growing new businesses, the founder’s average age was 45 at startup. Based on its data, Clifford-Lewis estimates that entrepreneurs have a much higher chance of success at 30 than at 20.\nSee Next: I Asked ChatGPT How To Build Wealth for the Rest of Trump’s Term: Here’s Its Plan\nTrending Now: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\n\nThe Value of Professional Experience Bezos started Amazon at age 30. He had graduated from Princeton University in 1986 and worked at several Wall Street companies, including Fitel and Bankers Trust. In 1990, he became the youngest-ever vice president of hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He opened Amazon in July 1995 at age 31.\nBezos said these 10 years of working for others improved Amazon’s chances of success . He gained hands-on experience leading a growing company, and these skills helped him guide Amazon through its early days of explosive growth. In only two years, he took the company public, with an initial public offering price of $18 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nBezos now counsels young aspiring entrepreneurs to follow a similar path. As he said in Turin:\n“I always advise young people, go work at a best-practices company where you can learn a lot of basic, fundamental things: how to hire really well, how to interview, etc. There’s a lot of stuff you would learn in a great company, and there’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it”.\n\nBezos believes that these early career lessons do what pure inspiration and talent cannot: They teach young entrepreneurs how to do things right from day one. This knowledge supports better decision-making, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company, which changed its name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in 2021 to emphasize its focus on building the metaverse, is making massive investments in artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. As a result, the company's revenue numbers continue to climb, but there's some nervousness among bears that the company may be overspending.\nThis is the fifth installment in a series of seven articles that rank the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026.

And he's never been afraid to do that. Meta Platforms has recorded losses of $73 billion so far on its Reality Labs division, which is charged with building virtual reality and augmented reality hardware and software to support the metaverse.\n\nI confess I never saw the appeal of the metaverse, so I was as relieved as anyone when Zuckerberg finally signaled a long-overdue pivot. According to Bloomberg, Meta is planning deep cuts in its Reality Labs division as the company pivots to developing artificial intelligence. Meta stock rose 4% on Bloomberg's early December report.\nThis time, I think that Zuckerberg is getting it right. Meta already has some massive platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, that have huge followings and tons of engagement. With its Meta AI assistant, the company can deliver personalized content and ads, including those powered by generative AI tools. Meta's Llama large language model enables users to create and interact with AI personas, providing more engagement across its family of apps.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd Meta's AI tools are having an immediate impact on the company's bottom line. Revenue in the third quarter totaled $51.24 billion, up 26% from a year ago. Net income fell from $15.68 billion to $2.70 billion, but that was only because of a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion that was required by the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Meta says excluding the charge, income would have increased to $18.64 billion.\n\nNotably, Meta recorded $50.08 billion in advertising revenue in the quarter, up from $39.88 billion a year ago.\n\"We are at an exciting point for our company, where we have continued runway to improve our core services today as well as the opportunity to build new AI-powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the future,\" management said in the earnings report.\nWhy Meta is No. 3 Meta is investing heavily in AI, with capital expenditures for 2025 expected to range between $70 billion and $72 billion. And that number is expected to increase in 2026, according to Chief Financial Officer Susan Li. But while other companies may struggle with that, Meta's in great shape. It generated $44.8 billion in trailing free cash flow during the third quarter, giving it the resources to invest in AI.\n\nZuckerberg wants Meta's AI spending to lead to \"personal superintelligence,\" which he describes as an AI companion that allows Meta's users to improve their relationships, automate work, encourage creativity, and help them achieve personal goals. That's an achievable goal, because that's how people are starting to use AI already.\nMeta stock is down 13% in the last three months and has been underperforming the S&P 500 for most of the year. But I think the shares are on the verge of a rebound, and are now trading at a discounted price-to-earnings ratio of less than 30. I believe that Meta stock will be a big winner in 2026, and this is an ideal place to buy a Magnificent Seven stock at a discounted price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:49 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nMeta Platforms' AI Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\nMeta Platforms is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META&rsquo;s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META&rsquo;s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms&rsquo; initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company&rsquo;s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet and Amazon , are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space\n\nMeta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\nAlphabet&rsquo;s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon&rsquo;s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nMETA&rsquo;s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\nMeta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 24.6%.\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s 6.62X. META has a Value Score of C.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.16 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, suggesting 1.75% year-over-year growth.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc.

They have made bank in Mac 7. Uh not only this year, the year before and the year before that, maybe even a couple years before. They're they're sitting on a lot of gains is what I'm trying to say. What should they be doing right now with these gains?\n00:14 George\nGood morning, Brian. Can you imagine being a short seller in this market and trying to bet against the the Mag 7 or the AI trade or anything. I mean, you get carried out. Short selling's been like the worst uh possible thesis on the market you could have the last 15 years other than maybe going long oil and gas stocks. So I I I would not bet against any of any of these complexes, any of these movements. You want to talk about earnings growth, this market's got it. A lot of the other developed countries really don't. So betting against the US has been a fool's game and I'm certainly not going to be doing it in 2026. I'm going not I'm be going to not try to time the market. I'm going to try to stay in there, stay positions as is and just trim and reallocate as as wisdom would would dictate.\n01:05 Brian\nGeorge, I just had a a guest on uh I'm doing double duty here. I was in the 9:00 a.m. hour and they were making the case for healthcare. If you had to stack up these two sectors side by side, you got uh AI plays, you got the Mac 7, healthcare. What excites you more and why?\n01:22 George\nYeah, I don't really like any of those the best. I think healthcare's seen a significant rally in the closing parts of 2025. If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer discussed.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s shares are up by 10.7% year-to-date after having dipped by 11% in late October. The stock had its worst day in three years after the firm released its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. While the results saw Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s $51.24 billion in revenue and $7.25 in earnings per share beat analyst estimates, investors were caught off guard by the firm’s capital expenditure guidance. As part of the earnings, management outlined that the firm would spend between $70 billion and $72 billion in 2025, the low end of which was higher than the previous guidance of $66 billion. Cramer had defended the stock after the earnings as he asserted that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was positioning itself to protect against OpenAI’s potential entry into the social media ecosystem. On December 19th, Wedbush cut the firm’s share price target to $880 from $920 and kept an Outperform rating as it commented on margin contraction in 2026. For his part, Cramer continues to be an ardent believer in Meta Platforms, Inc.

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Investing in These 3 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Right Now Could Set You Up for Life\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:57 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nWMT\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms continues to dominate with its social networks while exploring AI glasses, which can become a lucrative revenue stream.\nInteractive Brokers is one of the top beneficiaries of surging interest among investors who want to beat the stock market.\nWalmart's online ads continue to gain momentum and can yield higher profit margins in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Interactive Brokers Group ›\n\nInvesting in high-quality growth stocks and gradually building your positions can turn you into a millionaire investor. It takes a while to achieve that goal, and some people look beyond the S&P 500 index to amplify their returns. These are some of the most promising stocks that can produce appealing long-term returns.\nMeta Platforms is still a top-tier ad platform Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the second-largest advertising stock , only behind Google. However, Facebook's parent company has been reporting higher financial growth rates than Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which gives it an edge for new investors.\nTop-line results continue to expand, based on the company's 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter. Meta Platforms also recently launched its AI glasses, which may turn into a valuable revenue source that diversifies the company's finances in a few years.\n\nSocial media growth remains strong, with the company reporting 3.54 billion daily active users in Q3, which represents an 8% year-over-year increase. Continued demand for Meta Platforms' family of apps will yield more ad impressions and sales.\nInteractive Brokers is riding strong demand from investors When people make more stock trades and use margin to boost their exposure to equities, brokerage firms like Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ: IBKR) come out as the big winners. Shares are up by more than 40% year to date and have more than quadrupled over the past five years. Recent earnings results suggest that the momentum can continue.\n\nInteractive Brokers increased its total revenue by more than 20% year over year in Q3, with commission revenue and net interest income as two of the biggest winners. Strong engagement drove these results, with customer account growth increasing by 32% year over year. Interactive Brokers added 4.13 million accounts while delivering stock and options trading volume gains of 67% and 27% year over year, respectively.\nInvestors are still feeling good about the stock market based on a 39% year-over-year increase in Interactive Brokers' customer margin loans. Strong demand for the stock market should help the brokerage firm continue to outperform the S&P 500 and deliver millionaire-maker returns.\n\nStory Continues\nWalmart's pivot to advertising is a long-term tailwind that will boost margins Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) has made its mark as the world's top retailer and has a real shot at exceeding a $1 trillion market cap in 2026. The company continues to boost sales and delivered 5.8% year-over-year revenue growth for investors in Q3 FY26.\nHowever, the company's advertising segment is addressing one of Walmart's biggest weaknesses. Walmart enjoys high order volumes but struggles with profit margins. The company's net margins usually hover near 3% since retail stocks aren't known for high margins. Ads can be a game changer, especially since Walmart reported 53% year-over-year revenue growth for its global advertising business.\n\nAds don't make up a large portion of Walmart's total business, but they can grow over time and boost margins. In the meantime, Walmart continues to gain market share in retail while expanding its e-commerce sales, which were up by 27% year over year. Each Walmart store acts as a distribution facility, which results in lower shipping costs and quicker deliveries.\nFew companies can compete with Walmart in terms of size, and that works well for investors who want millionaire-maker stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Interactive Brokers Group right now?

At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the Best Quality Stocks to Buy Before 2026 . According to a report by The Wall Street Journal released on December 18, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is set to release two new and significant AI developments in 2026.\n​The company is developing its next large language model called Avocado, along with a new image and video generation AI model called Mango. The chief AI officer of Meta, Alexandr Wang, noted that these models are expected to be launched in the first half of 2026. Moreover, Wang also highlighted that the company is making the next LLM better at coding. In addition, the chief AI officer also pointed out that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is in the early stages of developing World Models, which are AI models that learn about their environment through visual inputs.\n​That said, on December 18, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was reiterated with a Buy rating and a $810 price target by Bank of America. The firm noted the company’s 2026 expense guidance and its LLM launch planned for the first half of 2026 as major catalysts behind the bullish sentiment. For long-term investors, BofA suggests that they should follow the company’s returns from heavy AI spending across core apps, ad monetization, and new ventures.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is focused on developing AI-powered social platforms and immersive technologies, including Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Beloved specialty clothing store closing after 49 years\n\nDaniel Kline\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:07 AM PST 4 min read\n\nRunning a family business for 50 years requires a lot of sacrifice.\nI grew up in a family business, Lynn Ladder & Scaffolding, which has actually existed for longer than that. When it's your family's business, there's little separation between work hours and off hours.\nAs a kid, I remember late nights when the alarm went off at corporate headquarters, and my father had to go meet the police in order to figure out what happened. When I got older and spent four years working for the business, I experienced early mornings bringing product to job sites to keep customers happy, and I learned that mixing family and business has its challenges.\n\nTo make any family business last nearly 50 years, you have to have a passion for it, and that's something Ronnie Sylvester, known as “Mr. Boot” in the Country and Western industry, had for Western clothing.\nHis store, Sylvester's Western Wear, served locals from its Louisiana store and was a regional destination as well as a tourist attraction. Sylvester ran the store until he passed away in 2020 following a battle with Parkinson’s disease.\nHis wife, Lisa Sylvester, has operated the business since.\n“My husband worked so very hard. He’s a legend. I wanted to carry on for him, but now it’s time in my life that I put my family first,” Lisa Sylvester told Fox 8 Live .\nThe store will close for good on January 5.\nChanging customer patterns hurt Sylvester's Western Wear Lisa Sylvester told Fox that shifting shopping habits have affected longtime local businesses like hers.\n“It sure does affect the local businesses that have been here for many many years,” she said. “You know it’s the way the world’s turning.”\n\"Worldwide, e-commerce retail sales will reach an estimated $6.42 trillion in 2025, representing 20.5% of all retail commerce,\" according to e-commerce data from Capital One .\n\nThe report showed the impact of online shopping, which has hit chains like Sylvester's Western Wear, which has a very limited website without an e-commerce business, especially hard.\nOver 2.77 billion people worldwide shop online.\nProjections indicate that value will increase to $8.91 trillion in 2030.\nBusiness-to-business (B2B) e-commerce spending will total $62.2 trillion by 2030.\neCommerce sales in 2025 will be up 6.86% from total e-commerce retail sales in 2024 ( $6.01 trillion ).\nU.S. retail e-commerce sales for 2025 are expected to total $1.47 trillion , up 9.78% from 2024 ($1.34 trillion).\nSylvester's Western Wear hinted at a closure While the shutdown plans were not made official until after Christmas, Lisa Sylvester has hinted at some coming changes in a pre-holiday Facebook post.\n\"One shop for continued savings! Again, thank you for your love and support through our 50 beautiful years. Can't wait to see what the future holds! Merry merry Christmas to everyone! Thank you,\" she wrote.\n\nThe store offered discounts as much as 50% during the Christmas season, which certainly suggested its owner was thinking about closing.\nMore Retail:\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\nE-commerce sales have been growing, and research shows that big players like Amazon and Walmart, which operate out of distribution centers, do impact local retailers.\n\"Establishment of an e-commerce fulfillment center reduces retail employment growth in the host county by an average of almost 1,000 jobs per quarter,\" the National Bureau of Economic Research reported .\nLocal stores closing hit communities hard The loss of a locally-owned store has deep impact on a community.\n\"In one week, 91% of American consumers shop at small and local stores, including over 122 million household shoppers,\" another Capital One study showed .\n68% or $68 out of every $100 spent at local stores remains in the local economy.\nAmerican shoppers spent an estimated $3.74 trillion at local stores in 2024, equivalent to 51.5% of all retail sales.\n8.67% of American small businesses are retailers ( 3.01 million out of 34.8 million total small businesses).\n\nA quick look at Sylvester's Western Wear's history Founded in 1976: Sylvester’s Western Wear operated from Kenner, Louisiana, for decades as a local staple in western apparel and boots, according to Manta .\nSylvester’s Western Wear operated at 2600 Williams Blvd. in Kenner, LA , selling boots, western apparel, and accessories to locals and visitors for decades, according to the Chamber of Commerce .\nCommunity staple with strong in‑store reputation: In recent years, many customers praised the store’s personalized service, wide selection, and friendly staff, contrasting with big‑box alternatives, according to Sylvester's Western Wear .\nDecember 2025 closure after decades: The family‑owned store closed its doors after decades in business, with local news noting its significance to the community as a longtime retail fixture, according to Fox 8 Live .\n\nSylvester’s Western Wear was more than just a place to buy boots and belts.

      "Content": "I'm an 83-year-old yoga instructor. I'm not your typical grandma — I still work to feel fulfilled and supplement my Social Security.\n\nNoah Sheidlower\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 6 min read\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Barbara Brown, 83, who works as a yoga instructor in Richmond, Virginia. Brown said her work has been fulfilling, given that many of her classes are at nursing homes . Though she needs to work to supplement her Social Security , Brown said she has no intention of retiring. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started working after school at the age of 15 and have been working ever since. My family wasn't well-off and needed help, so I took it upon myself to attend college at night and work all day.\nWhile I was in school, a gentleman from JPMorgan recruited me to work for the company. I began my career as an auditor after earning my degree in accounting.\nI spent over 15 years at JPMorgan, and it was a wonderful experience, but it wasn't easy. I then worked at smaller companies as a controller, overseeing accounting operations. I also worked for entertainment companies and startups in New York.\nBusiness Insider's \"80-over-80\" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. If you are 80 and older and still work, fill out this form to contribute to the series.\n\nRead our capstone story from the series and watch our video .\nI moved to Richmond about 20 years ago. My husband got sick and had a stroke, so we moved here because my son was going to college here. Richmond is very different from New York, but I found a job at a visual arts place, where I stayed for about 10 years until 2009.\nAfter retiring from that job, I became a yoga instructor, and I'm still running my business full-time at age 83.\nI've always done yoga I did so especially when I worked on Wall Street to keep my nerves together. In Richmond, I started doing a lot of yoga while I was working, and it came to a point where I thought I'd like to be a teacher, as I was getting older.\nI took my vacation time and spent two weeks at an ashram. I returned six months later to complete my training.\n\nI earned my first certification as a 200-hour yoga teacher and got a job at the Y, where I taught a class during my lunch hour in 2009. I then retired from my full-time job. I distinctly remember my last day, when I boxed everything up and then went to teach my yoga class . I never really stopped working.\nI would travel to cafés to teach seniors, and I taught at studios. I made it my business to teach everywhere and continue to study.\n\nStory Continues\nI led yoga retreats, taking people overseas to countries like Costa Rica and Guatemala. I would teach twice a day, and we would have vegetarian meals. I did that for seven years, in addition to my regular teaching.\nNow, I'm concentrating on teaching at nursing homes I have five nursing homes that I travel to, and I'm grateful because it's a great experience for me, as a person over 80 , to be in the shape I'm in. I visit several places where people experience memory loss, so I have developed a technique to teach them.\nThey love music, so I go in with a drum and get them singing. It's fascinating that people with memory loss often recognize familiar tunes. I can give them a laugh, and even with some loss, they can benefit from yoga.\n\nI teach chair yoga, so I don't have to get down on a mat. I can sit in the chair and demo to the class what needs to be done. I still privately teach one person on the mat who comes to my house.\nThere's a woman who never moves, and they put her in my class, and I looked over and saw her moving her hands and feet. It's a truly rewarding experience to see that I'm making a positive impact on people's lives.\nI can also work with young people — I can work with anybody. It's just that I couldn't work with young people constantly because I'd have to be on the mat, and that would be too much for my body, so this works for me.\nI'm not like the average yoga teacher. I've handled all the finances for my business and haven't asked anyone for help. I hope to continue teaching for as long as possible.\n\nI'm also a vegan, and I follow a very strict diet I've been vegan for over 35 years. It isn't very expensive to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, and I don't eat a lot. Seeing so many people in the conditions that they're in, many of whom are younger than me, I wish a lot of them would eat a better diet.\nI don't take any medications. At my last physical, I was told my vital statistics put me at age 40. I don't feel old. When I went to the chiropractor, one of the staff members asked me how old I was. I said, I'm not going to tell you, because then you put me in a range.\n\nI'm not working just for the money because I really love it, but I need the money to help me financially I work to supplement my Social Security , which would not be enough on its own.\nI bought a house to rent out, but when COVID-19 broke out, the renters didn't pay me for seven months. I'm still paying back my credit cards. I also have a mortgage on my own home.\nBecoming a yoga teacher is also extremely expensive. I could have never done it now.

The increase represents a “relatively more attractive risk/reward profile” for the company.\nBCE’s dividend has been “derisked with reasonable FCF payout ratios,” according to BMO Capital, easing a major worry for investors in the high-yield telecom industry.

(NYSE:BCE) also performed well in the third quarter of 2025, thanks to strategic acquisitions and collaborations. The company’s total revenue climbed by 1.3%, mainly due to the acquisition of Ziply Fiber. In addition, its adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.5% while maintaining a good margin of 45.7%.

      "Content": "Financially independent investors swear by this overlooked passive-income stream. Here’s why some call it ‘easy’ money\n\nJessica Wong\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nPassive income is more than Airbnb side hustles and dividend stocks . There’s another moneymaker that’s earning savvy investors money on the side.\nIt’s called private money lending, where everyday people — not banks or hedge funds — are pulling in returns just by wiring cash to local real-estate investors who need quick funding.\n\nBut how exactly does private money lending work, and is it right for you?\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nBenefits and risks of private money lending Think of private money lending as short-term, high-interest loans for real-estate deals. In this case, a private lender isn’t an institution like a bank, credit union or government-backed mortgage provider; it’s an individual or business that lends their own money.\nBecause they aren’t regulated like traditional banks, private lenders have more flexibility and they often focus on the value of a property instead of a borrower’s credit score or employment history. (1)\n\nFlippers, renovators, and buy-and-hold investors often need to close quickly, sometimes faster than a traditional bank will allow. So they borrow from private lenders instead, and pay for the privilege.\nA recent Business Insider article shared the story of Carl and Mindy Jensen, an early-retired couple who built a $5 million net worth. They’ve dabbled in different investment strategies, but one of their favorites is private lending. (2)\n“Private lending generates such a nice return that it's difficult to be like, ‘No, we don’t want the easy money,’” Mindy Jensen told Business Insider.\nAnother real-estate investor, Josh Lupo, was also featured in the article and said that interest rates of 10 to 12% are considered “normal” and 12 to 15% is common on shorter loans of around three to six months. The lender typically sets the terms.\n\n\"It takes us 30 minutes driving to the bank, wiring the funds, and then the investor that is borrowing the money sends us updates, and that's the extent of it,” Lupo told the website.\nBenefits High returns. You’re not pulling 12% from even the best high-yield savings accounts, and most rentals aren’t a short-term cash infusion. Private lenders like Lupo routinely see 12% on six-month loans or 15% on three-month deals, often backed by real estate.\n\nStory Continues\nHands-off investment. Private lending is an attractive option for older investors who’ve paid their dues unclogging toilets, replacing water heaters, and dealing with tenants. They still want real-estate-style returns, but without the headaches. Private lending keeps them in the game without the stress of being landlords.\n\nQuick turnaround. Real-estate investors love private lenders just as much. Speed is everything in the real estate game. Investor Mike Gorius told Business Insider he can close in eight days with private lenders compared with 30-plus days and a stack of paperwork when dealing with a bank (2).\nRisks Risk of default. If a borrower stops paying, you’re on the hook. Even though the deal is backed by real estate, there’s no guarantee you’ll recover your initial investment, especially if the borrower bails mid-project. You may also have to manage the foreclosure process.\nProperty-value risk. Private money loans may be secured by a house or building, but if values dip, the collateral may not cover what’s owed. In markets where After Repair Values (ARV)s get overly rosy, lenders can get left holding the bag.\n\nLiquidity and timing headaches. These deals are short-term, which means the borrower has to repay or refinance fast. If the market slows or a project hits delays, your money is stuck. And you can’t just sell your position since once that cash is in, it’s basically locked up. (3)\nRead More: This is the quiet portfolio shift many wealthy investors are making in 2026 . Should you consider it too?\nHow to get started If you think private lending is for you, you can get started using this roadmap:\nBuild capital first. Private lending requires cash, and while there’s no minimum, you’re looking at an average of between $50,000 and $250,000. (4)\nWhether it’s through house hacking, a rental or two, side hustles, dividend investing, or just saving aggressively, you’ll need to have some money ready to lend to get into the game.\n\nGet involved in your local real-estate scene. Relationships are key. The more investors you meet, the more deals you’ll be exposed to. Attend meetups, local investor events, and flip/wholesaler gatherings.\nStart small, scale smart. Most savvy private lenders grow by starting with a small loan, getting a good experience under their belt, lending again to repeat borrowers, and gradually levelling up to bigger deals. (5)\nThat said, if you want property exposure without the property headaches, private lending isn’t the only option to explore:\nREITs. Buy shares of real-estate investment trusts , collect dividends and stay hands-off.\nFractional ownership. Own slices of rental homes without ever talking to a tenant.\nCrowdfunded real-estate deals. Collectively invest in big commercial or residential projects using real estate crowdfunding investment platforms.\n\nGrocery-anchored commercial real estate. Grocery-anchored shopping centers can be surprisingly recession-resistant , and a smart diversifier.\nIf you’ve built up capital, want to earn some passive income, and love the idea of being the bank instead of the buyer, private lending might be the next big move in your portfolio. Just make sure you vet the deal and review your risks before handing over your money.\nYou May Also Like This $1B private real estate fund is now accessible to non-millionaires.

      "Content": "This Biotech Is Up 194% in a Year but One Investor Took Millions Off the Table\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:56 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INDV\n\nKey Points Oregon-based Stonepine Capital Management reduced its Indivior stake by 250,000 shares in the third quarter.\nThe overall position value fell by about $2.75 million from the previous period.\nAs of September 30, the fund reported holding 100,000 INDV shares valued at $2.41 million.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nOregon-based Stonepine Capital Management reported a sale of 250,000 shares of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ:INDV) , reducing its position by approximately $2.75 million, according to a November 13 SEC filing.\nWhat Happened According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated November 13, Stonepine Capital Management sold 250,000 shares of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ:INDV) during the third quarter. The transaction led to a decrease in the fund’s position value by approximately $2.75 million, bringing its Indivior holding to 100,000 shares worth $2.41 million at quarter-end.\n\nWhat Else to Know Stonepine's Indivior position now represents 1.96% of reportable AUM, down from 5.06% the previous quarter.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:VSTM: $23.58 million (19.17% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:ADMA: $10.83 million (8.81% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:EOLS: $9.43 million (7.67% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:ZVRA: $7.70 million (6.26% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:NKTR: $4.84 million (3.93% of AUM)\n\nAs of Friday, Indivior shares were priced at $36.21, up a staggering 194% over the past year and vastly outperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 15% in the same period.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of Friday)\n$36.21\nMarket Capitalization\n$4.53 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.18 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$124.00 million\n\nCompany Snapshot Indivior PLC develops and markets buprenorphine-based prescription drugs for opioid dependence, as well as treatments for substance use disorders, opioid overdose, and schizophrenia. Key products include SUBLOCADE, SUBUTEX PRO, SUBOXONE, OPVEE, and PERSERIS.\nThe company generates revenue primarily through the sale of branded pharmaceutical products, with a focus on long-acting injectable therapies and sublingual formulations targeting opioid use disorder and related conditions.\nIndivior's primary customers are healthcare providers, treatment centers, and government agencies addressing opioid addiction and mental health disorders in the United States and international markets.\n\nIndivior PLC is a specialty pharmaceutical company with a leading position in the treatment of opioid use disorder and related behavioral health conditions. The company leverages a diverse portfolio of proprietary therapies and invests in innovative pipeline assets targeting substance use and mental health disorders.\n\nStory Continues\nFoolish Take After years of volatility, Indivior finally looks like a company with operational momentum, and that’s exactly when position sizing starts to matter most for long-term investors. In the third quarter, Indivior posted $314 million in revenue, with SUBLOCADE sales up 15% year over year to $219 million, driving a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $120 million. Management raised full-year 2025 guidance sharply, now calling for $1.18 billion to $1.22 billion in revenue and as much as $420 million in adjusted EBITDA, while laying out a plan to generate at least $150 million in annual operating expense savings beginning next year.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, trimming a position after a 194% one-year run looks less like doubt and more like portfolio math. Stonepine remains concentrated in small and mid-cap biotech names, and even after the sale, Indivior still represents meaningful exposure relative to peers like ADMA, Eton, and ZVRA. Ultimately, Indivior’s fundamentals are improving, and the stock now reflects much of that progress. From here, returns hinge less on turnaround hope and more on sustained growth, cost discipline, and execution beyond this year.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable AUM: Assets under management that must be disclosed in quarterly SEC Form 13F filings by institutional investment managers.\nAUM (Assets Under Management): The total market value of investments managed on behalf of clients by a fund or firm.\nNet position change: The difference in the number or value of shares held in a security after a transaction.\nTop holdings: The largest investments in a fund’s portfolio, typically ranked by market value or portfolio percentage.\nQuarter-end: The last day of a fiscal quarter, often used as a reference point for financial reporting.\nBranded pharmaceutical products: Medications sold under a trademarked brand name, as opposed to generic versions.\nLong-acting injectable therapies: Medications administered by injection that release their active ingredients over an extended period.\nSublingual formulations: Medicines designed to be placed under the tongue for absorption into the bloodstream.\nOpioid use disorder: A medical condition characterized by problematic opioid use causing significant impairment or distress.\nPipeline assets: Experimental drugs or therapies a company is developing but have not yet reached the market.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $2 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTSLA\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom each have market caps around $1.6 trillion.\nAI is the driving force behind all three stock prices.\nOne of these tech leaders is seeing immediate results from AI spending, and its stock valuation is more attractive right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is responsible for adding trillions of dollars in value to a handful of companies over the last few years. Nvidia , for example, briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year, thanks to its dominant position in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). Four other companies sit firmly above the $2 trillion threshold as we approach the new year.\nBut three AI stocks currently have similar market caps around $1.6 trillion as of this writing, and are vying to become the first new $2 trillion company of 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Here's my prediction for the next company to top the milestone, and it could come as soon as next year.\nArtificial intelligence is fueling all three Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom have all seen their stock prices heavily influenced by advances in AI this year.\nMeta stock climbed higher early in the year as its efforts to improve its recommendation algorithms bore fruit. Ad revenue climbed higher as time spent on its apps increased, and ads became more effective. However, the stock took a step back recently as management shared plans to increase its AI-related spending.\n\nTesla's value is heavily tied to its robotaxi service and AI innovations. The stock received a boost over the summer when it launched its robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas. Investors added to those gains on promising progress on the company's next-generation AI chip for its vehicles.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator business has gained momentum in 2025, as the company signed big contracts with OpenAI and Anthropic, the latter of which is buying Alphabet 's Broadcom-designed tensor processing units (TPUs). To that end, Alphabet and Broadcom are seeing excellent progress in shifting more developer workloads to TPUs, which offer greater energy efficiency and cost savings versus Nvidia's GPUs.\nBroadcom stock took a step back after its last earnings report, as many analysts were disappointed with management's expectation that greater AI chip sales would come at a lower gross margin.\nWhile all three of these stocks have a path to a $2 trillion valuation in 2026, I expect Meta Platforms to reach the milestone first. Here's why.\n\nStory Continues\nAI-powered earnings growth at an attractive valuation Even with its run rate of $200 billion in annual revenue, Meta is still growing its bottom line quickly. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 20% in the third quarter, and improvements in AI are the reason.\nMeta has seen an increase in both ad impressions and price per ad for eight straight quarters. That indicates that it's increasing user engagement and opening new places within its apps for advertising while making ads more effective.\n\nManagement attributes a shift in its recommendation algorithm to make it more general across formats as the primary reason users are spending more time on its apps. Meta has seen similar improvements by applying the same methodology to its advertising algorithm. In other words, bigger models have directly translated into more revenue.\nThat trend should continue in 2026, as Meta opens up more opportunities for advertising, including on Threads and WhatsApp. It could also begin monetizing Meta AI, its generative AI chatbot. The improvements in its algorithms over the last couple of years should enable it to ramp up advertising quickly without as much negative impact on its pricing as we've seen in the past.\nThe bigger opportunity for Meta in 2026, though, may be the expansion of its generative AI features. It's reportedly working on an AI agent that can manage advertising campaigns for small businesses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly talks about the opportunity to handle everything involved with creating, testing, and optimizing ad campaigns on its platform through an AI agent.\n\nAnd chatbots specializing in sales and customer service for a company could open the door for more businesses to push Facebook and Instagram users to start messaging them through Meta's chat apps.\nWith small- and medium-sized businesses accounting for the bulk of advertisers on Meta's platform, these innovations have the potential to dramatically increase the amount they're willing to spend on ads. If the overhead for these clients is much lower, they can increase their ad spending and scale up their businesses faster.\nThose efforts should fuel another year of strong revenue growth. And while depreciation expense from the increase in AI-related capital expenditures could eat into earnings growth, Meta should be able to manage continued improvements in earnings per share with the help of share repurchases.\n\nThe stock trades for just 26 times forward earnings expectations, which is much lower than Broadcom's multiple and less than one-tenth the multiple Tesla stock trades for. I expect Meta to fetch a higher earnings multiple as it proves its AI spending to be well worth it once again in 2026, pushing its valuation to $2 trillion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?
