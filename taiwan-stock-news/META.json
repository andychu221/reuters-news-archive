      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has 18% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 Trillion-Dollar AI Stocks. Wall Street Says They Can Soar in 2026.\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve user engagement and advertising outcomes across its social media networks.\nMicrosoft has added generative artificial intelligence features (Copilots) to many of its software products, and its data center footprint is expanding rapidly.\nAmazon is leaning on artificial intelligence to makes its e-commerce business more profitable and to increase cloud computing sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, a hedge fund that outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points over the last three years. That makes him an excellent source of inspiration.\nLaffont had nearly 18% of his portfolio invested in three artificial intelligence stocks (each worth well over $1 trillion) as of the third quarter: 7.3% in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , 5.9% in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and 4.7% in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . He clearly has a great deal of confidence in those companies, and Wall Street anticipates substantial upside in all three stocks in the next year.\nHere are the important details.\nMeta Platforms: 28% upside implied by the median target price Meta has a strong presence in two industries: digital advertising and smart glasses. It owns three of the four most popular social media networks , which lets it collect user data and target media content. That advantage has made Meta the second-largest adtech company in the world. But the company also dominates the nascent smart glasses market.\n\nMeta is using artificial intelligence (AI) -- from custom chips to proprietary large language models -- to improve user engagement and advertising conversions across its portfolio of industry-leading social media. It is also developing a superintelligence system to integrate with its smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says glasses will be our \"primary computing devices\" in the future.\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look quite reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842 per share. That implies 28% upside from its current share price of $658.\nMicrosoft: 30% upside implied by the median target price Microsoft has a strong competitive position in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. It is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for its office productivity suite Microsoft 365, its portfolio also includes popular applications for business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning. Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft is monetizing AI across its software and cloud businesses. CEO Satya Nadella says customers are adopting Microsoft 365 Copilot (a generative AI assistant) faster than any new product. Additionally, its entire family of Copilot applications topped 150 million monthly active users in the quarter ended in September, up from 100 million in the quarter ended in June.\n\nMicrosoft Azure has gained about 3 percentage points of market share since the AI boom started, despite compute capacity constraints. However, the company is building out its data center capacity faster than any other cloud provider, according to Satya Nadella. Azure plans to double its data center footprint in the next two years.\nWall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to increase at 14% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look somewhat expensive, though investors eager to own the stock could still buy a small position today. Among 62 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 30% upside from its current share price of $485.\nAmazon: 32% upside implied by the median target price Amazon has a strong competitive position in three industries: e-commerce, advertising, and cloud computing. It runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company dominates retail media, one of the fastest-growing verticals in the broader digital advertising market. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nIn retail, Amazon has built an artificial intelligence shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales in 2025. Shoppers who engage the conversational chatbot are 60% more likely to make a purchase. Amazon has also developed generative AI tools that improve inventory placement, robot productivity, and last-mile delivery.\nMeanwhile, AWS is introducing artificial intelligence features at a rapid clip. In the last few months, the company added tools to Bedrock AgentCore that help developers build and deploy generative AI agents. AWS also added agents for software development, security fixes, and performance monitoring. And it expanded its portfolio of pre-trained models.\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 73 analysts, Amazon has a median target price of $300 per share. That implies 32% upside from its current share price of $228.\n\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Is Meta Stock a Buy Headed Into 2026?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 5:23 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta's revenue growth rates have been accelerating.\nThe company is investing heavily in AI, and its spending next year will likely be even more extreme.\nThe stock is no longer cheap. But it's not expensive either.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock has lagged in 2025. Shares of the Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads parent are up about 13% for the year, while the S&P 500 has climbed about 17%.\n\nThe gap looks odd given how the business has performed. The company has kept pushing faster growth out of its ad platform across its social media properties -- and it has continued to invest aggressively in AI (artificial intelligence) . If that spending does what management hopes, 2026 could be the year the stock rerates higher.\nOn the other hand, the same investment plan that could power the next leg of growth also raises the stock's risk profile. Any slowdown in revenue growth rates next year could derail investor confidence in Meta's plan to invest aggressively in long-term growth opportunities.\nStrong business momentum 2025 has been a standout year for the social media company 's business.\nMeta's second-quarter revenue rose an impressive 22%. This was a significant acceleration from 16% growth in Q1. But Meta didn't stop there. The third quarter pushed that pace to 26%, with quarterly revenue reaching more than $51 billion.\n\nThis growth was fueled by impressive advertising performance. In Q3, Meta's ad impressions rose 14% year over year. Additionally, average price per ad increased 10%.\nAnd it looks like the company will likely wrap up the year on a high note. For the fourth quarter of 2025, Meta expects revenue to be between $56 billion and $59 billion. The midpoint of this guidance range implies 19% growth. But the high end would translate to 22% growth. Both of these figures are well ahead of the 16% growth the company started the year with.\nMeta's biggest risk The biggest risk for the stock is not hard to name. Meta is building an enormous amount of AI capacity, and the bill is rising quickly. The company told investors it expects 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to come in at $70 billion to $72 billion.\nThen it raised the bar for 2026. Meta chief financial officer Susan Li said in Meta's third-quarter update that the company expects \"capital expenditures dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025.\"\nShe also warned that total expenses should grow faster in 2026, driven mainly by infrastructure costs, including higher depreciation and cloud spend.\n\nStory Continues\nThis investment plan can work. Meta ended the third quarter with about $44.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Additionally, it generated $10.6 billion of free cash flow (cash from regular operations less capital expenditures), even as its capital expenditures ramped up. And the company still managed to return cash to shareholders in the quarter. Specifically, it spent about $3.2 billion on repurchases and $1.3 billion on dividends.\n\nBut given the company's expectations for continued growth in capital expenditures, free cash flow will likely come down next year and possibly even turn negative, requiring the company to tap into its massive cash hoard.\nSo, given this combination of powerful business momentum and soaring spending, is Meta a buy going into 2026? With a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, the stock isn't cheap. But it may be worth paying up for. The stock's performance will likely boil down to whether Meta's big spending helps the company sustain its rapid top-line growth rates next year -- and given Meta's long history of strong execution, I think this is plausible.\nWhile I ultimately like the stock headed into 2026, investors should keep in mind the risks and watch the company closely. In addition, any position in the stock should probably be kept small. Any signs that Meta's AI spending isn't going to help the business materially could be a reason to revisit the bull case.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Be Worth More Than $2 Trillion by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Tesla is operating in a difficult environment.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are providing computing units for the AI build-out.\nMeta Platforms' stock was slammed due to spending plans.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nThere are currently five stocks that have a valuation of $2 trillion or more. Outside of these five, only a handful of others are in a position to be worth $2 trillion or more in 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nThe next largest company is Berkshire Hathaway , which has a market cap of about $1 trillion. For that stock to double would be a huge feat, especially without Warren Buffett at the helm, so let's put it aside.\nNow we're left with Meta, Tesla, Broadcom, and TSMC. Which of these will make it to $2 trillion by the end of 2026?\nAll will beat the market if they reach $2 trillion by 2026 The largest is Meta Platforms, sitting at a $1.66 trillion valuation. The smallest is Taiwan Semiconductor at $1.49 billion. That places all four of these stocks in relatively close proximity to each other, which means the required return is fairly similar. Meta would need to rise 21% while Taiwan Semiconductor must rise 34%. Both of these potential performance figures would indicate a market-beating stock, so if any of these companies can breach the $2 trillion threshold, they will likely be great to own.\nThe $2 trillion threshold is also uncharted territory for this group. Both Meta and Broadcom have come close, but neither has crossed into the $2 trillion zone.\nI think three will make it, while one will be left out If you sort the companies by growth rates, it's clear that there's one outlier: Tesla.\nIt's no secret that Tesla is struggling in the current environment, due to electric vehicle (EV) credits ending from the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the other three are posting incredible growth rates that don't look to be slowing down anytime soon in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips in the artificial intelligence supply chain. Without its production capabilities, none of the AI computing power we know now would be possible. Demand for AI chips isn't slowing down, and Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to continue growing at a rapid 21% pace in 2026, according to Wall Street analysts. However, these analysts have consistently underestimated Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the past few years, so don't be surprised if TSMC outperforms these expectations. Couple that with the second-cheapest valuation in this group, and Taiwan Semiconductor should reach the $2 trillion mark in 2026.\n\nStory continues\nMeta Platforms nearly entered the $2 trillion club, but pulled back following a poorly received third-quarter earnings report. While the business's performance was incredible, investors didn't like Meta's massive spending plans. There is growing concern that Meta is overextending itself, which is why investors have started selling off the stock. However, I think Meta is just the first company to max out its cash flows being devoted to AI computing capacity, and it won't be the last. The market will come back around to Meta's stock in 2026 and will send it back to levels allowing it to reach the $2 trillion point.\n\nLast is Broadcom, which also sold off due to 2026 guidance. Wall Street wanted greater visibility into faster AI growth, and Broadcom told investors they needed to be patient. Still, Broadcom informed investors that its Q4 AI revenue was $6.5 billion, up 74% year over year, and that it projects Q1's growth to be north of 100%. Broadcom is a much larger business than just AI, and the business isn't nearly as successful in those endeavors. Still, I think sustained growth from its custom AI computing units will drive Broadcom's stock higher in 2026, allowing it to reach the $2 trillion threshold.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

(GOOGL) and Meta Working Together To Challenge Nvidia’s Market Dominance: Report\n\nAshar Jawad\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:56 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is among the 14 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Now . According to a Reuters report on Wednesday, Google is working with Meta to make its AI chips better suited to running PyTorch, in a bid to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\nGoogle\nThe initiative, called TorchTPU, aims to position Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) as an alternative to the chipmaker’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) by ensuring compatibility with clients who have built their AI infrastructure on PyTorch. The Meta-built open source project has become one of the most widely used tools for developers.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had for years reserved a major chunk of the TPUs for internal use. However, the tech giant had been discussing with Meta over the possibility of the latter using more TPUs, said the report.\nIn other news, on December 16, Bloomberg reported that self-driving car company Waymo was in talks to generate $15 billion in capital. It plans on raising the additional funds from external investors and its parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which could help value the business at around $110 billion.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns several notable platforms such as Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, and YouTube. The company is also known for pioneering work and research in cloud computing, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Find the next big opportunity with these 25 smaller AI-focused companies with strong growth potential through early-stage innovation in machine learning, automation, and data intelligence that could fund your retirement.\nAlibaba Group Holding Investment Narrative Recap To own Alibaba today, you need to believe that its AI focused cloud platform and core China commerce assets can, over time, outweigh near term profit pressure and geopolitical uncertainty. The H200 export approval is directionally helpful for its AI cloud story, but chip access remains only one piece of the key short term catalyst, which is whether AI related cloud growth can offset heavy spending in quick commerce and AI infrastructure without prolonging margin strain.\n\nThe expansion of Cainiao and Tmall Supermarket fulfilment for Taobao Shangou, enabling four hour delivery in 31 cities, ties directly into that catalyst by showing where a lot of that spending is going. It reinforces that Alibaba is committing real capital to instant commerce at the same time as it pushes Qwen powered cloud services, which increases execution risk if user growth or order density falls short of what is needed to ease losses.\nYet investors should also factor in how prolonged losses in quick commerce could pressure Alibaba’s margins and cash flows if...\nRead the full narrative on Alibaba Group Holding (it's free!)\nAlibaba Group Holding's narrative projects CN¥1260.3 billion revenue and CN¥171.1 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Alibaba Group Holding's forecasts yield a $197.98 fair value , a 32% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives 73 members of the Simply Wall St Community currently place Alibaba’s fair value between US$107.09 and US$266.34, with views spread across this full range.

      "Content": "TikTok's future uncertain after US joint venture deal, says analyst\n\nReuters Videos\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 10:58 AM PST\n\nIn this video: ORCL\n\nMETA\n\nSTORY: The deal to hand control of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a group of investors, including Oracle, marked a major turning point after years of uncertainty over the future of the popular video app. But former Peking University business professor Jeffrey Towson says it raises new questions about the new entity’s ability to compete. \"It's not obvious what happens with this company going forward because you just went from a global platform to a regional one, but your competitors are still global. Their primary competitors are YouTube and Facebook, Instagram reels. Well, if they're separate, then they are dramatically smaller than the global giants, which was not the case last month. So that has some interesting, sort of, business strategy and competition questions that get raised.\" The deal is aimed at avoiding a U.S. ban of the short video app, which is used regularly by more than 170 million Americans. It comes after a yearslong saga to force TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its U.S. operation, which began in August 2020, when President Donald Trump first tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over U.S. national security concerns. Financial terms of the deal, announced in an internal memo by TikTok (U.S.) seen by Reuters, were not disclosed. The White House said in September the new joint venture would operate TikTok's U.S. app, but questions remain about the deal, including the business relationships between the new joint venture and ByteDance… which will still own about 20% of the U.S. company. Sources told Reuters in September that ByteDance would also own a separate division that would control the revenue-generating business operations such as e-commerce and advertising. Those arrangements formed the deal framework announced on Thursday, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday. \"The big question is still, is Chinese government going to approve this? Because they've never actually said that they would. The Trump administration has said its been approved by them, but we've never actually heard anything from the Chinese government formally. Now, who knows what's going on behind closed doors? In theory, that could happen quite quickly or it could emerge as a problem. I suspect it's probably not a problem, but we don't actually know the other major party at the table in terms of the decision making here.\" Oracle will own the majority of the joint venture along with private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Shares of Oracle rose as much as 8% in Friday morning trading.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "ByteDance Is Quietly Printing $50 Billion--and Might Soon Rival Meta\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:49 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nORCL\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nPeople familiar with the matter have indicated that ByteDance could be heading toward a standout profit year, with the TikTok parent on track for roughly $50 billion in profit in 2025 after generating about $40 billion in net income over the first three quarters. The figures suggest the company has already moved past its own internal targets, potentially putting its earnings trajectory close to that of Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ:META ), which is projected to earn about $60 billion this year. While ByteDance has not disclosed updated revenue figures, it had previously aimed for about a 20% increase in 2025 sales to $186 billion, a level that would leave it just below Meta's projected revenue base.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs ORCL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThis financial progress is unfolding alongside ongoing regulatory pressure in the US, where the Biden administration has sought to restrict TikTok on national security grounds. According to an internal memo, TikTok chief executive Shou Chew told employees that ByteDance has signed binding agreements to form a new US joint venture that would be majority-owned by American investors, including Oracle Corp. ( NYSE:ORCL ). Chinese regulatory approval remains outstanding, which could influence the final outcome, but the move appears designed to preserve TikTok's US operations while reducing direct Chinese control. A ByteDance spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nOperationally, the burden of growth has increasingly shifted toward TikTok as Douyin faces softer consumption and advertising trends in China. TikTok has continued to expand globally, pushing into e-commerce and livestream shopping and partnering with companies such as Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), while also stepping up its cultural presence with events like its first TikTok Awards in Los Angeles. Investors have responded with rising valuation marks, with SoftBank's Vision Fund previously valuing ByteDance at above $400 billion and later transactions implying levels as high as $480 billion. Even as growth could moderate compared with earlier years, ByteDance's scale, expanding international reach, and ambitions in artificial intelligence suggest its earnings and strategic direction will remain closely watched.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why is Truth Social owner Trump Media merging with a fusion energy firm?\n\nLauren Aratani in New York\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:42 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group, owner of Donald Trump ’s social media platform, Truth Social, announced a merger on Wednesday with a company developing fusion energy technology.\nTAE Technologies, an energy company founded in 1998, will join with Trump Media via a $6bn merger that it promises will propel it to build “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant” next year.\n\nThe move signals that the president and his family continue to look for profit-seeking ventures outside of Truth Social, which remains tiny compared to rival platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter).\nHere is what we know about the deal so far.\nWhat did Trump Media announce? The media company, which has dabbled in financial services, is engineering a huge pivot and diving headfirst into nuclear energy.\nRelated: Trump Media announces $6bn merger plan with fusion power company\nTrump Media has “built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans”, according to its CEO, Devin Nunes. “And now we’re taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.”\n\nNunes, a former congressman, is set to serve as co-CEO of the new company with Michl Binderbauer, TAE’s CEO. Shareholders of each firm will own about 50% of the combined company. The company will be overseen by a nine-member board of directors, which will include Trump.\nTrump Media has also agreed to give TAE $300m in cash to continue developing its fusion energy technology.\nThe deal comes amid soaring demand for new energy sources that can feed artificial intelligence and the massive datacenters that power it . While this deal is a big bet on fusion power meeting that demand, a commercially viable reactor has never been built.\nSo is Trump Media still a social media company? Kind of. Trump launched the company in 2021 to be a competitor to the big tech companies that had kicked him off their platforms at the time, including Facebook and Twitter. But Truth Social has only a few million active users, a speck compared with the larger platforms.\nThough Truth Social went public on the stock market as part of Trump Media in 2024, the wider firm has been racking up losses: $54.8m in the three months to 30 September, more than double those incurred during the same period of 2024.\n\nShares of the company soared when Trump was re-elected for a second term, but they are down almost 60% since the start of the year.\nThe merger with TAE, while seemingly out of left field, is on track with the company’s attempts to diversify Trump Media’s assets beyond Truth Social. In recent years, it built out a massive, volatile cryptocurrency treasury and tried to create new financial products and betting markets .\n\nStory Continues\nWhat exactly is fusion energy? TAE is one of a handful of companies that is working on developing fusion energy , a type of nuclear energy that mimics the power of the sun to produce energy.\nWhile a type of nuclear energy, fusion energy is different from the nuclear energy that was developed in the 1940s, which was created through fission. Fission energy was created by splitting atoms, whereas fusion energy creates energy by forcing atoms together.\n\nThe technology is still in its early stages, and some scientists are skeptical that it can be produced at a commercial scale.\nBut demand for clean, safe energy has skyrocketed with the AI revolution, which has put enormous amounts of pressure on the energy grid. This is why tech companies and AI leaders such as Google parent company Alphabet and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have been investing in fusion energy companies including TAE and Helion Energy, which are trying to commercialize fusion energy.\nWait, why is this deal happening? The move by the Trump family business into the fusion energy space comes amid steps by the Trump White House to bolster the technology.\nRelated: ‘We wanted to take action’: US toy company fights back over Trump tariffs\nSince entering office in January, the US president has made moves to deregulate the nuclear energy industry and accelerate technology development, including signing executive orders that deem developing new technology as an issue of national security.\n\nTrump’s Department of Energy has especially been focused on the new technology, with the creation of a new Office of Fusion whose goal is to get fusion technology ready for commercial use as quickly as possible.\nAfter the merger, TAE said it will start construction on a utility-scale fusion power plant that it hopes will generate power for commercial use by 2031. In an interview with CNN , TAE’s Binderbauer said more capital will mean the company can build its plant more quickly.\n“The velocity [at which] you can get the capital is differentiating. If I raise $2bn over five years, I can’t build the plant sufficiently fast,” Binderbauer said. “Sometimes you get lucky and you meet the right people.”\nDan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, noted that TAE will probably get “major political support from President Trump” because of the deal, though Binderbauer told CNN that he welcomes regulatory scrutiny.\n“I’m not looking for anything special,” Binderbauer said. “Perhaps you get more scrutinized from a regulatory perspective and that’s good because it will give the world confidence that technology is what matters.”\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Opening Bid with Brian Sozzi to talk about his expectations for the Magnificent Seven and the broader AI trade.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat is the future of the AI trade and how are you playing it next year? Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AppLovin's Margin Engine Fuels its Accelerating Momentum\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:21 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: APP\n\nAppLovin ’s APP most recent results underscore a company whose performance is increasingly driven by extraordinary margin strength, highlighting a business model built for operating leverage and efficiency.\nIts profitability profile now stands well above typical industry benchmarks, with third-quarter 2025 results offering a clear view of how powerful its operating structure has become. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 82% illustrates AppLovin’s exceptional ability to translate incremental revenue into profit, reinforcing margins as the central force behind its continued momentum.\n\nThis margin strength is rooted in APP’s cost-light infrastructure and automated ad-delivery ecosystem. The company benefits from a structurally lower reliance on human-driven creative processes, shifting more of its workflow into genAI-based optimization. Leadership highlighted that generative AI is reshaping creative development, onboarding, and recommendation systems, reducing manual overhead while improving ad performance. This technology-first approach allows AppLovin to gain operating leverage as revenue scales, and recent results validate the strategy.\nThe third quarter showcased this dynamic clearly: revenues increased 68% year over year, yet adjusted EBITDA rose 79%. Net income surged 92%, reflecting how efficiently the company transforms growth into profitability.\n\nPeer View: Meta and The Trade Desk Meta Platforms META is doubling down on its AI-driven Advantage+ campaigns to maintain dominance amid AppLovin’s Axon push. Meta’s vast user network gives it unmatched reach, but advertisers are increasingly testing alternatives. Meanwhile, The Trade Desk TTD continues to expand its OpenPath platform, offering transparent programmatic access and positioning itself as a neutral counterweight to walled gardens. The Trade Desk and Meta’s ongoing innovations highlight how competition in AI advertising is intensifying, with AppLovin’s Axon now emerging as a credible challenger in the space.\n\nAPP’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates The stock has gained 104% over the past year compared with the industry’s 13% growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, APP trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46.6, which is well below the industry average of 25. It carries a Value Score of D.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for APP’s earnings has been on the rise over the past 60 days.\n\nStory Continues\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAPP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "AI hyperscalers have room for ‘elevated debt issuance’ — even after their recent bond binge, BofA says\n\nJason Ma\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BAC\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThe tech giants fueling the AI boom generate so much cash relative to their debt that they have more than enough room to issue more, according to Bank of America .\nIn a note this week, analysts looked at the top five publicly traded AI hyperscalers: Meta , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Oracle .\nBofA pointed out that while the companies can fund their near-term capital expenditures with cash, they are tapping debt markets for balance-sheet flexibility and better cost of capital. Last month alone, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon raised tens of billions of dollars in the bond market.\n\nOperating cash flow for the big five hyperscalers is expected to hit $577 billion this year from $378 billion in 2023, while debt should climb from $356 billion to $433 billion.\nThat means their overall debt burden is actually getting lighter as the debt-to-cash ratio should dip from 0.94 to 0.75.\n“Given the hyperscalers’ historically conservative capital allocation and balance sheet policies, elevated debt issuance is possible, as evident by the recent bond deals from Meta, Alphabet and Amazon,” BofA said.\nAnd plenty of additional cash is on the way. By 2029, operating cash flow is seen jumping 95% to $1.1 trillion, while capex is forecast to grow at a much slower pace of 58% to $632 billion.\nBut then there’s Oracle. Unlike the other AI hyperscalers, it will have negative free cash flow until 2029, meaning its capex will exceed cash from operations, according to BofA. As a result, it doesn’t have much capacity to take on more debt.\n\nIndeed, fears about Oracle’s debt binge have rattled the overall AI stock trade as the company isn’t a cash machine like its AI peers.\nRecent earnings guidance was also weak, and the company raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 capex by another $15 billion. In addition, surging lease obligations have spooked Wall Street.\nA Financial Times report on Wednesday that said alternative investments firm Blue Owl didn’t team up with Oracle on a data center after all piled on more concerns. Shares fell on the news, though the company’s development partner, Related Digital, said Blue Owl was outbid on the project and didn’t back out of it.\nBut even though debt may not pose a limit on hyperscalers’ ambitions, they still face physical limits , namely in building enough infrastructure fast enough to meet demand.\nData-center researcher Jonathan Koomey told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg that capital can be deployed instantly, but the equipment that capital must buy cannot. Tmelines for turbines, transformers, specialized cooling systems, and high-voltage gear have stretched into years, he explained.\n\nStory Continues\n“This happens every time there’s a massive shift in investment,” Koomey added. “Eventually manufacturers catch up, but not right away. Reality intervenes.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meta is strengthening its AI product offering by releasing the models in the first half of 2026. During an internal conference, Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang claimed Mango would generate visuals and movies, while Avocado believed to be Meta's Llama language model successor will improve code. He noted that the business is investigating world models, AI that simulates and predicts real-world events.The claim followed Meta's former top AI scientist Yann LeCun's departure to create a world model firm. Wang joined Meta this year after Meta spent roughly $15 billion in Scale AI, demonstrating its commitment to next-generation AI research.Due to competition from OpenAI and Anthropic, Meta revamped their AI division to speed up research and delivery. Some executives pondered switching from Llama to competing models before recommitting to in-house innovation, according to reports.The next releases of Mango and Avocado are anticipated to help Meta extend its AI-driven content and productivity features across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ:META) has positioned itself to be a key player in the AI race. The firm differs from players such as Google and Amazon through the fact that it does not operate a cloud computing business. Yet, while Google, Amazon, and Microsoft spend on AI data centers to bolster their cloud computing capabilities, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to spend just as much despite not being a major player in the industry. The spending has also seen the focus of analysts, with TD Cowen commenting on December 4th that the firm’s decision to cut back its metaverse spending could counter the increased spending on AI infrastructure.

Together, these capabilities are intended to enable more precise interrogation of disease biology and higher-confidence advancement of CNS drug candidates.\n\n\"Therapeutic progress in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases has been constrained by four fundamental challenges: crossing the blood–brain barrier, entering the neuron, releasing the drug into the cytoplasm while avoiding endosomal degradation, and targeting the intracellular pathways that drive disease,\" said Bruce McCormick, Chief Executive Officer of Mercury Bio. \"Our focus at Mercury Bio is on advancing therapeutics that address those intracellular mechanisms. The yEV technology supports that goal, and Meta-Flux adds the biological intelligence needed to ensure we are targeting the right pathways with confidence.\"\nMeta-Flux's platform integrates multi-omics data and disease-scale simulations to model how neuronal pathways respond to therapeutic intervention, enabling more informed program design and biomarker strategies in direct support of Mercury Bio's CNS therapeutics.\n\n\"This partnership allows us to evaluate disease mechanisms and therapeutic hypotheses in a context that has historically been inaccessible,\" said Lee Sherlock, Chief Executive Officer of Meta-Flux. \"By applying our modeling framework to Mercury Bio's CNS programs, we can help strengthen the biological rationale behind advancing large-molecule therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease.\"\n\nStory Continues\nThe collaboration reflects a shared commitment to building a more disciplined, data-driven approach to advancing therapeutics for diseases of the brain.\nContact:\nKaelie Barnard | Director of Marketing, Barson Corp.\n406694@email4pr.com | 516-712-6050\nMeta-Flux | Corporate Communications 406694@email4pr.com\nView original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mercury-bio-and-meta-flux-announce-strategic-collaboration-to-advance-large-molecule-therapeutics-for-parkinsons-and-alzheimers-diseases-302646691.html\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily ESG Dive newsletter .\nDive Brief: Frontier &mdash; the decarbonization initiative backed by Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, McKinsey and others &mdash; announced on Thursday it had facilitated a $44.2 million carbon offtake agreement for its buyers with Canadian company Nulife GreenTech.\nNulife&rsquo;s carbon removal process uses biowaste as a feedstock to produce a concentrated bio-oil and biochar that can then be stored underground in salt caverns. Under the agreement, the company will remove 122,000 tons of carbon dioxide for Frontier&rsquo;s buyers between 2026-2030, Frontier said in a blog post .\nThe offtake purchases were facilitated for Stripe, Google, Shopify, H&M and other Frontier members, according to the post. Frontier also has a partnership with sustainability platform Watershed, which allowed additional companies, including Canva and Skims, to participate in the offtake, the post said.\n\nDive Insight: Frontier said its buyers were Nulife&rsquo;s first customers in 2024 in a prepurchase agreement, according to Thursday&rsquo;s announcement. Nulife has so far delivered 407 tons of removals as part of that prepurchase, according to Frontier&rsquo;s portfolio page . Frontier and its buyers have also previously invested in other bio-waste removal companies, including a $58.3 million deal with startup Vaulted Deep in 2024.\n\nNulife&rsquo;s carbon removal process utilizes hydrothermal liquefaction, converting biomass waste from facilities like food processors, municipal waste facilities and paper mills into a carbon-rich oil. Nulife touts a patented hydrothermal liquefaction process, but the conversion process typically involves turning a feedstock into an oil through chemical reactions that take place in hot, compressed water, according to the American Chemical Society .\nIn a Thursday press release , Nulife called the deal a &ldquo;significant vote of confidence&rdquo; in the company&rsquo;s platform and &ldquo;real-world waste management value.&rdquo; Nulife Co-founder Jerry Kristian said the deal gives the company &ldquo;the long-term demand signal&rdquo; needed to scale its biomass removal and storage platform.\n\nThe deal will allow Nulife &ldquo;to deliver permanent carbon removal while helping communities and commercial operators &mdash; including agricultural processors, industrial facilities, and municipal operators &mdash; manage organic waste more sustainably and cost-effectively,&rdquo; Kristian said in the press release.\n\nStory Continues\nFrontier estimated in its blog post that the volume of carbon removal through the hydrothermal liquefaction process &ldquo;could reach 1.5 gigatons of CO2 removal per year by 2040.&rdquo;\nOther Frontier members involved in the offtakes include McKinsey Sustainability &mdash; a founding partner of the initiative &mdash; engineering design firm Autodesk and enterprise HR software platform Workday. Online dating service company Match Group, independent primary care network Aledade, vehicle fleet management platform Samsara, flight comparison company Skyscanner, fintech Wise and software-as-a-service firm Zendesk also participated through Frontier and Watershed&rsquo;s partnership, according to the blog.\n\nFrontier reports a decarbonization portfolio that includes over $713 million in offtake agreements and 1,886,898 tons of contracted CO2 removals, including $261 million and 688,300 tons of contracted removals since December 2024. Frontier has backed 52 total carbon removal projects, and Nulife and Vaulted Deep are among 13 biomass carbon removal and storage projects that the initiative has backed, according to its portfolio.\nRecommended Reading\nFrontier signs $58.3M deal with bio-waste carbon removal startup Vaulted Deep\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company May Now Be Winning the AI War\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:52 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After ChatGPT took some of its search traffic, Alphabet rebounded by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode.\nAlphabet's Gemini 3 is considered a leading LLM.\nManagement will increase the tech giant's capital expenditures in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIt's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world in significant ways, and the major hyperscalers are all investing hundreds of billions of dollars in their efforts to capitalize on the trend. Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

The models are expected to release in the first half of 2026, signaling a long-term play to move beyond the incremental updates of the current Llama family.\nThe development of Mango and Avocado represents the first major output from Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a specialized division created after a major restructuring this past summer. To lead the group, CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally orchestrated high-profile recruiting efforts, poaching more than 20 researchers from OpenAI and hiring Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, to oversee the effort.\nThe move underscores Zuckerberg’s willingness to spend aggressively to close the gap with rivals. As part of the transition, Meta reportedly invested over $14 billion to acquire a near-majority stake in Scale AI, cementing Wang’s role as the primary architect of Meta’s post-Llama strategy.\n\nDuring the internal session, Wang emphasized that Avocado will focus heavily on advanced coding capabilities, a traditional weak point for previous Meta models compared to competitors.\nMore ambitiously, Wang noted that Meta is in the early stages of developing \"world models.\" Unlike current LLMs that predict the next word in a sequence, world models aim to understand physical reality by processing vast amounts of visual information.\nMeta stock remained relatively flat in after-hours trade following the WSJ report, though shares rose 2.3% during trading hours.\nRelated articles\nMeta bets on ‘Mango’ and ‘Avocado’ in AI race - WSJ\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.79% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.38%.\nThe stock of social media company has risen by 10.02% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.85% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Meta Platforms in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $8.15, signifying a 1.62% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $58.37 billion, indicating a 20.63% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $23.43 per share and revenue of $198.75 billion. These totals would mark changes of -1.8% and +20.82%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.16% higher. Meta Platforms is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Meta Platforms has a Forward P/E ratio of 27.72 right now. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 28.76 of its industry.\n\nInvestors should also note that META has a PEG ratio of 1.68 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. META's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.87 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 60, this industry ranks in the top 25% of all industries, numbering over 250.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

By outperforming established approaches from Meta, DeepMind-affiliated researchers, and Harvard, Corti's new Gradient Interaction Modification (GIM) technique proves that specialized labs can lead in fundamental AI research - the kind that shapes how the entire industry builds, understands, and deploys intelligent systems\nThe \"surgical\" shift\nAs models aspire to reach AGI-level complexity, the industry is realizing the need to sharpen comprehension - we cannot control what we cannot see. The focus is shifting from simply scaling parameters to understanding the mechanisms behind them.\n\n\"Until now, much of AI development has been empirical rather than mechanistic - we train models and observe results, but struggle to understand why they work,\" said Lars Maaløe, Co-Founder and CTO at Corti . \"GIM reveals the internal logic that standard tools miss, turning model improvement from trial-and-error into precision engineering.\"\nThe technical breakthrough\nTraditional interpretability methods test neurons in isolation - like testing light switches one at a time. However, if the light only turns off when all switches are flipped, testing them individually falsely suggests that neither switch matters.\nGIM solves this by analyzing how components interact when changed simultaneously, revealing the actual circuits driving behavior rather than backup mechanisms. This enables researchers to:\n\nPinpoint Causality: Identify the specific circuits responsible for outputs, not just correlated signals.\nDebug Surgically: Trace failures like hallucinations to their root cause.\nScale Efficiently: Run deep analysis on production models in seconds - critical for meeting regulatory requirements like the EU AI Act (Article 13) .\nHigher standards for the highest stakes\nHealthcare AI demands higher explainability standards than consumer applications. When models influence clinical decisions, institutions need forensic-level precision to trace reasoning and validate safety - not just aggregate accuracy.\n\nStory Continues\n\"In healthcare, we don't have the luxury of 'good enough' - we need to know exactly why a model made a specific decision,\" said Andreas Cleve, Co-Founder and CEO of Corti . \"High-stakes verticals require surgical precision. We built GIM because we needed it for our own clinical infrastructure, but the result is a tool that accelerates progress for the entire field.\"\n\nThis addresses a problem that's becoming universal. As transparency requirements expand across finance, autonomous systems, and government services, the methods necessary for clinical deployment today are becoming table stakes for all regulated AI tomorrow.\nCorti has released GIM as open source, making the method immediately available to researchers, developers, and organizations worldwide. Developers can access the implementation through a Python package here .\nAbout Corti\nCorti is a research and development company that specializes in state-of-the-art AI foundation models and infrastructure for healthcare. Its mission is to eliminate administrative hurdles in healthcare and life sciences and to bring expert-level reasoning to every corner of the globe - driving down costs and improving quality of care through purpose-built AI models you can trust.\nCorti's models integrate seamlessly into any healthcare application through Corti's SDKs and APIs, enabling vendors, providers, and payers to leverage safe, cutting-edge AI across the entire care journey.\nwww.corti.ai\nCONTACT: press@corti.ai\nView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/corti-unlocks-surgical-ai-improvement-outperforming-big-tech-in-interpretability-benchmark-302646275.html\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company\n\nSamantha Dorisca\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nDarrell Spencer is shattering various glass ceilings.\nThe Chicago native credits his hustling nature to his parents. His mother works as a postmaster for the United States Postal Service. His father worked for the Chicago Police Department and rose through the ranks to become a commander before retiring. His father also has a real estate portfolio, which was an additional stream of revenue for the family and was an early sign for Spencer that there are other financial paths to follow outside the confines of corporate America.\n\nWorking In Big Tech After completing a bachelor’s in economics at Connecticut College on a full-tuition national scholarship, Spencer got a job in finance but later pivoted into big tech. He has worked at Facebook, Google, Pinterest, and LinkedIn within their customer sales department in advertising, he told AFROTECH. Still, he felt called to entrepreneurship.\n“I helped them generate millions of dollars in revenue through a strategy across each different platform at each company that I was at,” he shared. “Did really well there. However, I just didn’t feel fulfilled. I woke up every day feeling just like it was routine. And it got to a point where I was very dissatisfied with the trajectory of my life. I felt as if there was more in life that I had to do. And growing up, I’ve always known that I wanted to do something in business … I just never knew what I wanted to do, but I’ve always known I wanted to create.”\n\nLeap Into Entrepreneurship In 2021, Spencer’s first swing as a founder was with Kings Crowning, which offered a satin-lined cap that was a functional, stylish, alternative bonnet for men. The business launched from a storage unit and grew into a multimillion-dollar company, leading him to become a first-generation CEO and millionaire by the time he was 27 years old, per Business Insider.\n\nCrowned Skin Fast forward to March 2024, and Spencer is on to his next brainchild, Crowned Skin, a science-backed skincare and grooming brand for men. The inspiration for the company came from a place of frustration while walking down retail aisles, seeing little representation and few innovative products for men in these categories, he told AFROTECH\n.\nSpencer made an upfront investment of between $10,000 and $15,000 into Crowned Skin with the income generated from King’s Crowning, coupled with real estate investments. These funds were recouped within a few months, he recalled. The investment gave him the financial freedom to create products, establish warehousing, and fund advertising.\n“I just wanted to create products that made men feel seen and confident,” Spencer explained. “I think men across the board, there’s this stigma when it comes down to men’s beauty, men’s grooming. It’s this hush topic that men don’t feel comfortable talking about.”\n\nStory Continues\nCrowned Skin offers body butter, cologne, and body oil in a range of scents, including its newest scent, Empire.\nSpencer has been intentional with growing the company to be profitable and self-sustaining. Strategic decisions, such as pivoting early in Crowned Skin’s marketing messaging, have helped him guide the company towards those goals. Working at various big tech companies as an ads manager allowed him to understand the power of attention and how to retain it.\n\nThis knowledge influenced how the brand positioned its products. Spencer showed the functionality of the products, which include ultra-moisturizing and healing properties; aligned with what would resonate with men, such as the allure of certain scents; and demonstrated the products’ efficiency, as they could cut morning routines in half by functioning as a two-in-one product.\n“We ended up running with those street marketing pieces. And then we learned that through creative messaging, through compelling five- to ten-second ad content around that messaging, that’s what really compelled. That’s what really propelled the business forward very, very fast,” he acknowledged.\n“So then at that point, we were getting our revenue shot up. The business was funding itself. We were very profitable. We were mindful of our return on ad spend, and we were able to scale up as more funds came in. And the next thing we knew, at that point, we really didn’t need any outside investments,” he added. “We didn’t need any other injections of capital … We chose to scale intentionally and scale when revenue came in.”\n\nRevenue Crowned Skin earned $4 million in revenue within its first year and is now a multi-million-dollar company, Spencer confirmed to AFROTECH\n. This feat is aided by strong teams across financial, fulfillment, product development, and manufacturing. Additionally, e-commerce has remained a major component of Crowned Skin’s success through Amazon and TikTok Shop, which have particularly helped boost revenue for the venture.\n“If you want to be a highly competitive and successful brand and company in today’s age, you need to diversify, be on every e-commerce channel across the board, and be your best at all of them. TikTok Shop has been huge. TikTok shop is becoming one of our biggest revenue channels. And the way that you can work with affiliates and really seed samples and fuel your company through affiliates, but also the age of live selling on TikTok, we’re coming into a whole new age of e-commerce marketing,” Spencer explained.\nTikTok Shop has become a six-figure-a-month channel for the company. Crowned Skin also makes history as the first Black male-founded skincare company to reach the #2 spot on TikTok Shop, according to information shared with AFROTECH\n.\n“I get to really be a forward-thinking leader in this space as a Black man in an underrepresented category where there’s not many other Black males doing this … This all was self-taught … Representation is everything for me because I think there’s so many other Black men out there that are in that similar position, but honestly, fear might stunt them. I’m really proud that I get to really create this amazing company and showcase all that you can do as a Black man. If you truly put your head down, it really works,” Spencer explained.\n\nFirst Retail Partnership The overarching goal is to position Crowned Skin as a one-stop shop for men’s grooming. There are currently various products in research and development, including body washes and deodorants, Spencer told AFROTECH\n. It will also soon gain greater visibility following its first-ever retail partnership with Walmart.com. There are plans to later expand regionally, then nationally on store shelves, Spencer shared.\nSpencer also stated that he intends to raise a Series A, likely in 2026, to scale the company globally.\n\n“I want Crowned Skin to be around for years and years, and I want it to last even when I’m not here. I want this to be a legacy company … I want global access … That’ll be an amazing opportunity for us to scale to even more heights, bring on an amazing partner or partners right in this space that have done it, that have scaled companies to nine, 10 figures, and that can really position Crowned Skin to be one of the most dominating forces in men’s grooming,” he expressed.\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nThe post Darrell Spencer Helped Big Tech Make Millions, Now He Leads A Science-Backed Skincare And Grooming Company appeared first on AfroTech .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

With shareholders of each company expected to own approximately 50% of the merged entity, the transaction is expected to close in mid-2026, subject to approvals.\nFollowing the announcement, Trump Media shares are surging 37% in early trading today as the merger aims to create one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies. It would position the combined firm to build utility-scale fusion power plants, with the first one beginning construction next year. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs.\n\nTruth Social's Limited Reach Truth Social was launched in 2022 as an alternative platform emphasizing free expression, but has struggled to achieve broad market traction because of its association with President Trump -- Barron's reports he indirectly owns about 115 million shares of the company. Instead, the app primarily attracts users aligned with his political base, limiting its appeal beyond that demographic.\n\nReports indicate Truth Social has far fewer active users compared to established platforms such as Meta Platforms ' ( NASDAQ:META ) Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- which collectively boast billions of monthly active users worldwide -- and X, which also commands hundreds of millions of users. Truth Social's user base remains significantly smaller, with estimates placing it in the low millions, reflecting challenges in expanding beyond its core audience.\nFusion: Energy's Chimera TAE Technologies was founded in 1998 and has pursued nuclear fusion -- a process mimicking the sun's energy production -- for over 25 years. Fusion is often called the energy industry's holy grail due to its potential for abundant, clean power without long-term radioactive waste, unlike traditional nuclear fission.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has built and operated five experimental reactors, raising more than $1.3 billion from investors, including Google and Chevron ( NYSE:CVX ). The company now plans to advance to utility-scale operations, aiming to commence construction on its first commercial plant in 2026. This step represents a significant escalation from research prototypes to power generation capable of supplying electricity to the grid.\n\nDespite progress, achieving commercial fusion remains elusive globally, with no operating plants producing net energy for the grid. TAE's ambition to deploy utility-scale facilities faces substantial technical and financial challenges. Although the company has demonstrated advancements in reactor design, transitioning to reliable, cost-effective power production is fraught with hurdles.\nKey Takeaways TAE's timeline for a utility-scale plant beginning next year appears highly ambitious, requiring not only technical breakthroughs but also extensive regulatory approvals from bodies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy.\nTrump Media is seeking to leverage growing energy demands from artificial intelligence data centers, where fusion could theoretically provide vast power. However, combining a social media operation with cutting-edge fusion research represents a sharp divergence from core businesses for both entities. It reeks of opportunistic grandstanding by attempting to capitalize on the hot topic of AI's energy demands, much like its previous venture into the crypto world.\n\nGiven fusion's history of overpromising and delay -- and the merger's execution risks -- the deal carries a high probability of complications, setbacks, and failure. Investors should avoid buying into the hype. If TAE and Trump Media can actually succeed in the effort, there will be plenty of opportunity to buy in afterward.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nMatt Hussey,Jason Nelson\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:40 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMETA\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts —self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps , that run without banks, governments, or big tech.\n\nWhen programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain —not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games , digital art , and assets worth billions.\nUltimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.\nThis guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.\nSmart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.\nSmart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.\n\nWho Invented Ethereum? Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.\n\nDevelopment of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nA crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.\n\nThe network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.\nThe switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work\nThis shift, known as “ The Merge ,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.\nBlocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhat applications have been built on Ethereum? 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.\n📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.\n💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.\n💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.\n💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.\n🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.\n\nTimeline: Major milestones in Ethereum Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.\nMid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.\nJuly 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.\nSeptember 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.\nMarch 2016: Homestead upgrade improves protocol security and usability.\nApril 2016: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, launches via crowdsale.\nJune 2016: Hackers exploit The DAO and drain roughly $50 million in Ether. Community votes to hard-fork, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\nOctober 2017: Byzantium hard fork enhances performance, privacy, and sets the stage for Proof-of-Stake.\nDecember 2017: CryptoKitties and CryptoPunk NFTs go viral, stressing network capacity and highlighting scalability issues.\nJanuary 2018: ERC-721 NFT standard is introduced, enabling unique digital assets.\nDecember 2020: Beacon Chain launches, beginning Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake.\nMarch 2020: Visa begins settling USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin transactions using Ethereum.\nApril 2021: Berlin hard fork reduces gas costs.\nAugust 2021: London hard fork activates EIP-1559 ; introduces fee burning, reducing inflation.\nSeptember 15, 2022: “The Merge” transitions Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, cutting energy use by more than 99 percent.\nApril 12, 2023: The Shanghai upgrade enables withdrawal of staked Ether from the Beacon Chain.\nMarch 13, 2024: The Dencun upgrade introduces proto-danksharding, a step toward reducing costs and increasing scalability.\nMay 7, 2025: The Pectra upgrade, combining Prague and Electra updates, aims to expand staking flexibility and improve Ethereum’s efficiency.\nDecember 3, 2025: The Fusaka upgrade introduces changes to Ethereum's data availability and block capacity.\n\nEthereum and DAOs One of Ethereum’s most radical innovations was the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes . Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.\nThe first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack , but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.\n\nWhat Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?\nSince then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon , to investment collectives like Syndicate , and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO , which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.\nSupporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.\nA network tested by crisis If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.\nEthereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.\nThe community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nEthereum and the NFT boom Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.\nThe breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties , CryptoPunks , and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\nBy 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million , and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.\nEthereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nThe race to scale Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.\nTo address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 . The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.\n\nVitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'\nEthereum and the Web3 vision Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.\n\nBut competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana , Cardano , and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.\nEthereum and privacy In 2025, privacy has become a key focus of the Ethereum project. In November, Vitalik Buterin stated that \"Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene,\" building on a narrative in which he framed it as a fundamental requirement for digital systems such as blockchain platforms.\nEthereum Foundation Launches New Cluster Focused on Privacy\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has followed suit, launching a privacy cluster in October 2025 that includes 47 researchers, coordinators and cryptographers. The Foundation also launched Kohaku, a \"privacy-first\" toolkit for Ethereum, alongside a browser wallet and SDK. Upon its launch, Buterin commented that \"Full-stack privacy and security are first-class priorities in Ethereum.\"\nA decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.\nWhat’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

JPMorgan's 2026 outlook, backed by new CEO survey data, suggests markets are now recalibrating expectations — shifting focus from AI adoption to whether it actually delivers profits.\nGenAI Fell Short Of CEO Expectations PwC's latest global CEO survey, covering more than 4,700 executives across 109 countries, shows a clear expectation gap. While over 40% of CEOs entered 2025 expecting GenAI to boost revenue and nearly half anticipated a lift in profitability, only about one-third reported meaningful gains in either metric by year-end. Efficiency improvements were more visible, but even those undershot initial expectations.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nJPMorgan's interpretation isn't that AI spending was misplaced — it's that monetization arrived slower than anticipated. Adoption moved quickly, but translating that into top-line and margin expansion proved harder than forecasts implied.\nFrom Experimentation To ROI Discipline That gap is now changing behavior. JPMorgan notes that boards and CFOs are pressing harder on return on investment, favoring projects with clearer financial outcomes over open-ended experimentation. Growth alone is no longer enough; it needs to come with margin discipline.\nAs a result, valuation frameworks are tightening.

And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

People familiar with the discussions say Anthropic is considering leasing around 25,000 square feet in the city over the next three to five years, although the final figure could be lower as plans continue to evolve. Other AI firms, including OpenAI, are understood to be evaluating similar space requirements, marking a possible shift away from the small, flexible co-working offices both companies currently use in Dublin.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nIs META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThis search for larger offices comes as fast-growing AI players look to build out operations abroad and compete for users, even as concerns circulate around the possibility of a trillion-dollar AI bubble. Dublin already hosts the European hubs of major technology groups such as Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) and ByteDance's TikTok, and industry observers suggest the current AI boom could reinforce the city's long-standing ties to US technology firms. Anthropic declined to comment on its specific leasing plans but said it is expanding rapidly, with existing European offices in London, Paris, Zurich and Munich, and has described EMEA as its fastest-growing region in a November blog post.\n\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), also declined to discuss specific property plans, but said it employs about 60 people in Ireland and expects to continue adding staff in 2026. The company began its Dublin operations in 2023 and is advertising roles including software engineers and trust and safety analysts, while also planning to increase the size of its London office. Together, these developments suggest that Dublin could see increased activity from AI companies seeking to scale their European operations, even as the pace and final shape of that expansion remain subject to change.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump Media is merging with fusion power company TAE Technologies in $6B+ deal\n\nTim De Chant, Amanda Silberling\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TATE.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies , a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.\nThe all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.\n\nTMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch , the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”\nTMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.\nTruth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.\n\nTMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.\nBut the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.\nCurrently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion , are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.\n\nIf one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.\n\nStory Continues\nTAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.\n\nOver the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.\nIn the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.\nAfter the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8b941382-ff1c-35a6-a44b-22dba0ec5010/meta-platforms-%28nasdaq%3A-meta%29.html",
      "Content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 18)\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:50 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nThis year, one of the better performers among the Magnificent 7 had been Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ: META ). But its third-quarter earnings report raised investor concerns about the company’s massive capital spending on artificial intelligence initiatives. In addition, Meta says it plans to make significant cuts to the budget of its Reality Labs metaverse division in the coming year. The stock is down 13.6% since the quarterly report was released.\n\nStrong quarterly reports earlier this year (despite a tax charge) had lent credence to the claim that Meta would continue to outshine its competitors over the next year. The share price hit an all-time high of $796.25 back in August. Due to the recent pullback, the stock is up 4.9% year over year, underperforming the broader market. Furthermore, the near-term future of the economy is uncertain—just like the markets themselves—and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a controversial figure. Certainly, Zuckerberg's sudden shift to the metaverse and brand name change to Meta Platforms raised a few eyebrows several years ago.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Meta Platforms Inc.’s ( NASDAQ: META ) AI push has been a key driver for the company in 2025, with integrations coming across numerous platforms, which is fueling engagement and increasing ad sales.\nDespite economic cloudiness, Meta announced that its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) estimate increased significantly, much of which will be allocated to AI project development and integration.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNow, the Meta Platforms CEO is shifting the company's focus and riding a powerful, bullish trend. Against this complex backdrop with many moving parts, investors should consider the wide range of Meta stock price targets and formulate a strategy for all possible outcomes. To help, 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis. Let's jump in.\nWhy Invest in Meta Platforms? Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room. Investors should not rely on Meta Platforms' Reality Labs metaverse business to drive the company's near-term future growth. In Q3 2025, Reality Labs generated $470 million in revenue, up from $370 million in revenue in the prior quarter. However, during that same time frame, Reality Labs recorded a loss from operations of $4.43 billion.\n\nFortunately, it appears that the CEO's attention has turned to a different tech field lately. In particular, Zuckerberg seems to expect AI to be Meta Platforms' key driver going forward. AI integrations into Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp could provide an economic moat for Meta Platforms if new features translate to greater user engagement. WhatsApp, in particular, has seen notable growth with more than 3 billion monthly users now.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta's AI focus evidently helped the company succeed in the third quarter of the year despite losses in its metaverse business. Impressively, Meta Platforms grew its revenue 26% year over year to $51.2 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus call for $49.5 billion. Furthermore, excluding a one-time tax charge, the company's earnings per share (EPS) surged 20% to $7.25, easily outpacing the analysts' consensus estimate of $6.74.\n\nThere's no doubt that Zuckerberg is all-in on the AI revolution now. He envisions a future in which AI will be used for \"a lot\" of \"social tasks.\" And he believes it's \"really compelling\" that AI will \"get to know you better and better.\" Some reporters have expressed skepticism of an AI-infused future. Yet, if Meta Platforms can parlay machine learning into profits, investors shouldn't dismiss the growth potential of Meta stock.\nAnother key driver for Meta Platforms is its Threads short-form messaging platform. Granted, Threads is still playing catch-up to the popular X platform, which is owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Still, Threads is making inroads as its monthly active user count grew from 320 million in 2024's fourth quarter to 350 million in Q1 of 2025. That's not at the level of X, which reportedly has more than 580 million monthly active users. Yet, perhaps AI feature integration can make Threads even more competitive with X in the coming quarters.\n\nThe company expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenue to range from $56 billion to $59 billion. That is expected to be driven primarily by ongoing strength in its advertising business, bolstered by the positive impact of AI-driven enhancements to ad targeting and user engagement across its family of apps.\nMeta Platforms as a Stock It is impossible to know how the economy will perform going forward. Similarly, it remains unclear whether Meta Platforms will achieve significant returns on its AI investments. These unknowns will not stop analysts from publishing their Meta stock price predictions, though.\nOppenheimer and Benchmark downgraded the stock following the third-quarter earnings release, citing increased capex concerns. However, BofA Securities has reiterated its Buy rating on the shares, keeping its price target at $900 and affirming long-term confidence in Meta, citing its user base and potential AI integration opportunities. Cantor Fitzgerald also reaffirmed its positive stance by reiterating an Overweight rating and $920 price target. It anticipates that improvements in AI execution will lead to a \"sentiment reversal\" for the company in 2026.\n\nThe aforementioned uncertainties are reflected in the wide range of Wall Street analysts' price targets for Meta Platforms. The Zuckerberg-led firm has a high price target of $1,117.00, a median price target of $837.92, and a low target price of $685.00. However, the consensus recommendation of 67 analysts covering the stock remains to buy shares.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$685.00\n5.5%\nMedian\n$837.92\n29.0%\nHigh\n$1,117.00\n72.0%\n\nMeta Platforms 2025 Outlook Meta Platforms raised its 2025 capex estimate from a range of $66 billion to $72 billion to a range of $70 billion to $72 billion. By now, you can probably guess what Meta Platforms is spending those extra billions on. If you guessed AI, you are correct. More specifically, Meta Platforms' management anticipates \"additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.\"\n\nHence, the multi-billion-dollar question is whether Meta Platforms can effectively leverage its costly AI enhancements. That's difficult to predict. The same goes for the state of the economy, which might not support an increase in ad spending if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate in the remainder of this year.\n24/7 Wall St.'s Meta forecast is a more bullish than the mean forecast, calling for the share price to rise to $935.29 by the end of next year. That implies a run of 44.0%. It is based on the company’s ability to sustain strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency. This should drive its bottom line despite higher capital expenditures for AI objectives.\nUltimately, your price target for Meta Platforms stock should depend on whether you expect the company to take full advantage of ramped-up AI features. If so, then get ready for Meta Platforms stock to eventually head for new all-time highs. However, it may be a bumpy ride along the way.\n\nMeta’s Heavy AI Spending Justified Says Pro. Is He Right?\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided.

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(META) Boasts Significant Upside Potential Despite Morgan Stanley Price Target Cut\n\nNeha Gupta\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:15 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMS\n\nGOOG\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) is one of billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2026 . On December 11, Morgan Stanley cut its price target of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to $750 from $820 while reiterating an Overweight rating.\nMeta App 3D sign\nThe price cut comes amid concerns that sentiments around the social media networking stock have turned negative. That’s in part because of growing fears about revenue durability, operating expense uncertainty, and issues around the company’s Llama AI model. The shift in sentiment comes amid growing confidence in Alphabet’s prospects, buoyed by the tech giant’s AI initiatives.\n\nDespite the cut, the price target represents a significant upside potential. Additionally, Morgan Stanley insists Meta is one of the few companies that can leverage its data, distribution capabilities, and AI investments to generate long-term value.\nAdditionally, the stock came under pressure after the company detailed plans to develop a closed, monetizable AI model incorporating technology from Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba. Avocado is the proposed AI model slated for release next spring. Meta will reportedly retain control over the closed AI model, marking a significant departure from the open-source model it has championed over the years.\nThe Pivot towards a closed model is part of an effort to address the disappointments associated with Meta’s Llama 4 Open Source model.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a tech giant focused on connecting people through social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), advertising, and building the future of the internet with virtual and augmented reality (Metaverse, Quest headsets, AI), aiming to blend digital and physical worlds for work, play, and connection.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: META ) is one of the Top AI and Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. On December 4, analyst John Blackledge of TD Cowen maintained a “Buy” rating on the company’s stock, retaining the price objective of $810.00. The analyst’s rating is backed by a combination of factors highlighting Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s strategic cost management and potential for earnings growth.\nOne of the main reasons is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s plan to significantly reduce its Metaverse-related expenses, which form part of the Reality Labs segment. As per the analyst, such cost reductions are anticipated to be ~30% by 2026, potentially leading to savings of $5 billion – $6 billion. Notably, this move can help partially mitigate the increased spending on AI infrastructure, which happens to be a key area of investment for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Stanley reduced its price objective on the company’s stock to $750.00 from $820.00, while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. While the firm reduced its price objective, it believes that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) happens to be one of the few selected companies that could leverage leading data, distribution capabilities, and AI investments to fuel earnings power and maintain technological leadership.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
