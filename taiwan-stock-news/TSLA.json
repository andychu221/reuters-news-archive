      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Here's Why Rivian Stock Is a Buy Before Jan. 1, 2026\n\nRyan Vanzo, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Rivian is a bona fide AI stock.\nSales could skyrocket next year thanks to new, cheaper models in its EV lineup.\n10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›\nShares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) languished for most of 2025. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 1, the company's stock price barely budged, although there were sporadic ups and downs along the way. Over the past month or so, however, shares have skyrocketed in value by more than 40%.\n\nI have been urging investors to take a closer look at Rivian stock all year. In many ways, the company appears to have the potential to become the next Tesla . Even after the latest price spike, shares still appear to be a long-term buy for several reasons, the most significant of which is expected to see serious progress in 2026.\nInvestors finally realize Rivian is an AI stock Take a quick look at Tesla's valuation and you'll realize that its stock is priced at a huge premium to nearly every other electric vehicle (EV) stock . It trades at a price-to-sales ratio of around 17. Rivian, meanwhile, trades at just 4.2 times sales.\nThere are many reasons for Tesla's premium. The company has a huge capital advantage, plus the best brand recognition in the industry. But it also has a leading position in robotaxis, a market that some experts believe will eventually be worth more than $5 trillion.\n\nThe robotaxi market looks like a high-tech business. But it's much more than that. Investors have been betting on autonomous-driving stocks for more than a decade.\nProgress has been slow. Cameras and detection devices cost a lot of money, and real-world testing has been limited due to safety and regulatory concerns. But artificial intelligence (AI) has vastly accelerated the timeline in recent years.\n\"There is a massive leap in AI happening right now, and it is resulting in smarter end-to-end AI systems that can learn much more efficiently, are interpretable, and can generalize to every possible scenario on the road,\" said Raquel Urtasun, the CEO of Waabi, a company that specializes in self-driving technology. \"These advances result in autonomous vehicles with superhuman capabilities that will enhance road safety and transform transportation as we know it.\"\n\nTesla has wisely invested heavily in AI, and investors have been keen to reward it for its efforts. In general, AI stocks have performed very well in 2025, so being lumped into that category has created direct gains for shareholders.\nFor most of the year, Rivian was not considered an AI stock. But I repeatedly pointed out how Rivian was also investing heavily into AI, just like Tesla. Rivian scheduled an AI day in early December, and shares seemingly started rising based on expectations.\n\nStory Continues\nExecutives largely delivered, with fresh updates on hands-free highway assist, point-to-point navigation, eyes-off alerts, and personal level 4 autonomy. Expect the EV maker's AI progress to continue to strengthen in 2026. But there's a catalyst I'm even more excited about over the near term.\nRivian will finally compete with Tesla next quarter Tesla has many vehicle models on the market. But its cheapest two models -- the Model Y and Model 3 -- account for more than 90% of its vehicle sales. To compete directly with Tesla, EV makers must have several impressive models priced under $50,000.\nThus far, few companies have achieved this feat. Most competing EVs are either too expensive or are priced cheaply with lackluster features and relatively minimal range.\n\nRivian currently has only two models on the road: the R1S and R1T. Both are priced above $70,000, significantly above what most consumers are willing to pay. But next quarter, production is expected to begin on the R2, its first model priced under $50,000. Two more models will follow: the R3 and R3X, both expected to be priced under $50,000.\nWithin a few months, Rivian could go from being a niche luxury automaker with AI upside to a legitimate Tesla competitor. More vehicles on the road give it more real-world data, further strengthening its AI.\nEven after the recent share price run-up, Rivian still has a market cap of less than $30 billion. Compare that to Tesla's $1.5 trillion valuation, and the long-term upside in Rivian stock becomes clear.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now? Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Elon Musk Predicts A New Economy: No Poverty, No Hunger And Work Is Optional\n\nErica Kollmann\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:01 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk has often shared a radical vision for the future of the global economy, suggesting that humanity is on the brink of a “post-scarcity” era characterized by the end of poverty and the elimination of labor.\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, he suggested that “applied intelligence” could trigger double-digit economic growth in the near term and triple-digit growth within five years.\n“Double-digit growth is coming within 12 to 18 months. If applied intelligence is proxy for economic growth, which it should be, triple-digit is possible in ~5 years,” he said on X.\nMusk basically predicted the end of the industrial age and the beginning of an “intelligence age” defined by abundance.\nDon't Miss:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\n“Applied Intelligence” Musk's theory is based on the idea that AI—specifically artificial general intelligence (AGI) and autonomous robotics—is the ultimate hack for productivity.\nIn standard economics, growth is limited by labor and capital. However, if AI can be scaled like software and embodied in hardware (like the Optimus robot), the cost of labor collapses toward the cost of electricity.\n\nNear-term (12-18 months): Double-digit growth (10%+) would be unprecedented for a developed economy like the U.S., which typically grows at 2-3%. This rate and timeframe suggests Musk expects immediate, massive efficiency gains from AI integration.\nLong-term (~5 years): Triple-digit growth (100%+) implies a doubling of the economy annually. This is mathematically transformative, suggesting a world where goods and services are produced so rapidly and cheaply that the GDP metric itself might become obsolete.\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nSkepticism Vs. Vision Critics argue that Musk's proposed timelines ignore realistic physical and regulatory hurdles.\nReal-world economic growth requires energy infrastructure, raw materials and global supply chains, none of which can scale at the speed of code.\nEven if intelligence is infinite, the lithium for batteries and the copper for power grids are not. Other inventions that transformed society, like steam or electricity, took decades to move the needle on national GDP.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, if Musk is even partially correct, the primary challenge for society will shift from “how do we create wealth?” to “how do we distribute it?” in an era where human labor is no longer the primary driver of value.\nRead Next:\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nHave $100k+ to invest?

      "Content": "Analysis-Waymo's San Francisco outage raises doubts over robotaxi readiness during crises\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPCG\n\nTSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A widespread power outage in San Francisco that led to Waymo robotaxis stalling and snarling traffic earlier this month has raised concerns about the readiness of autonomous vehicle operators to tackle major emergencies like earthquakes and floods.\nDriverless taxis from Alphabet unit ​Waymo, a ubiquitous feature on the city's streets, were stuck at intersections with their hazard lights turned on as traffic lights stopped working following a fire ‌at a PG&E substation that knocked out power to roughly one-third of the city on December 20, videos posted on social media showed. Waymo halted operations, resuming a day later.\n\nThe incident has renewed calls for ‌stricter regulation of the nascent but fast-growing industry as other companies including Tesla and Amazon's Zoox race to expand robotaxi services in several cities.\n\"If you get a response to a blackout wrong, regulators are derelict if they do not respond to that by requiring some sort of proof that the earthquake scenario will be handled properly,\" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Waymo said that while its robotaxis are designed to handle non-operational traffic signals as four-way stops, they occasionally request a ⁠confirmation check. Though the vehicles successfully traversed more than 7,000 ‌darkened signals on Saturday, \"the outage created a concentrated spike\" in confirmation requests that \"led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets,\" Waymo said.\n\nRobotaxi operators around the globe use remote access by humans - known in the industry as \"teleoperation\" - in varying degrees to monitor and control ‍vehicles. Waymo, for example, has a team of human \"fleet response\" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver, its bot, when it encounters a particular situation.\nBut such remote assistance has its limitations, and the Waymo outage highlights the need to regulate how robotaxi operators use the technology, said Missy Cummings, director of the George Mason University Autonomy and Robotics Center and former adviser to ​the U.S. road safety regulator.\n\"The whole point of having remote operations is for humans to be there when the system is not responsive in the way it should ‌be,\" she said. \"The federal government needs to regulate remote operations,\" Cummings said. \"They need to make sure that there's backup remote operations when there's some kind of catastrophic failure.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCalifornia's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulate and issue permits for the testing and commercial deployment of robotaxis, have said they are looking into the incident.\nThe DMV said it was talking to Waymo and other autonomous vehicle makers about actions related to emergency response. It also said it was formulating regulations to ensure remote drivers \"meet high standards for safety, accountability and responsiveness.\"\n\n'A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW'\nDeploying and commercializing fully autonomous vehicles have been harder than expected with high investments to ensure the technology is ⁠safe and public outcry after collisions forcing many to shut shop.\nFollowing a high-profile accident in 2023 ​when a robotaxi from General Motors' Cruise dragged a pedestrian, regulators revoked its permit, eventually leading the ​company to cease operations.\nBut robotaxis have returned to the spotlight with Tesla rolling out its service in Austin, Texas earlier this year and CEO Elon Musk promising rapid expansion. Waymo, which has grown slowly and steadily over the years since its launch as Google's self-driving project in ‍2009, has also accelerated expansion.\nWith a fleet of ⁠more than 2,500 vehicles, Waymo operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Metro Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe company said the confirmation processes its vehicles follow were established during early deployment and that it was now refining them to match its current scale. Waymo is implementing fleet-wide updates that provide vehicles with \"specific ⁠power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.\"\nBoth Cummings and Koopman said robotaxi operators should face additional permitting requirements once their fleets grow beyond a certain size to ensure that they have adequate ‌capabilities to deal with large-scale failures.\n\"If this had been an earthquake, it would have been a problem,\" Koopman said. \"This is just a shot across ‌the bow.\"\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Alistair Bell)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Travis Hoium, joined by Lou Whiteman and Rachel Warren. As a big topic this week is electric vehicles, and Ford is really the one that is the impetus for this conversation, even though you don't necessarily think about them as an EV company, but they are getting more or less getting out of the EV game, taking a $19.5 billion write off. Look, Lou, EVs were the future of the auto industry a few years ago. Every single company said that they were going to basically go 100% to EVs. You have Tesla, Rivian, Lucid , and others were thought to be disrupting Detroit. It's only been four years since a lot of those bets were made, and now we're really backing off. Tesla's sales are in decline. GM has pulled back. Now, Ford is doing the same. Were EVs over hyped, or what changed in the last few years, because this seems like a huge about-face?\n\nLou Whiteman: What changed? Four years and one administration, shall we say. But look, I am hesitant to say it was over hyped, but I do think we definitely got ahead of ourselves. I still believe EVs are the future. I believe that is where we're going. But I think the timeline was probably likely always going to be longer than we had hoped, and honestly, that we priced in. There was a new administration, and some of the incentives did change, which I think is part of what happened now. I don't want to put too much on the administrations. The subsidies, they were nice. But I think that if we're to take from this that the subsidies were the only reasons that these were selling, that the dependency is what makes EVs work, that's the wrong lesson. The subsidies were necessary, because the tech just isn't ready for prime time. It's not ready for anyone except the early adopters now.\n\nStory Continues\nTravis Hoium: Is it the tech or is it the cost? Because one of the things that I always go back and forth on is, people talk about range anxiety and infrastructure and things like that. I actually think those are pretty good for 99% of travel, and now we've got fast charging and things like that. But when I go look at an EV and go, could we replace our Volkswagen Atlas, a three-row SUV for a family of five with a dog? It just doesn't make any financial sense. Is it the technology, or is it the cost structure just isn't quite there yet, and really, the comparison in the industry is not to cars. It's to SUVs and trucks, and that's what people buy when they buy ice vehicles today.\n\nLou Whiteman: I think you're splitting hairs on cost versus tech, because I think part of the answer on cost is tech. Solid state, yes, will alleviate range anxiety. I think you're overly dismissive on that. I think whether or not it is practically a problem, I think if you could sit down and talk people through it, it's less of a problem than people think, but I do think it is the big bugaboo in people's heads why they dismiss it. But look, part of what solid state or whatever next generation batteries could do is mean that you can pack more storage energy density into them, fewer batteries, less cost. I think technology is the answer to the cost problem. It's pick your flavor, but I think it comes down to the fact that, the technology, as we have it today, is not sufficient for mass market sales in and of itself.\n\nTravis Hoium: Rachel, when you look at these companies stepping back from electric vehicles, what are you thinking about, because these big trends, we're talking about trillions of dollars in value that is up for grabs for investors, either on the plus side or the downside.\nRachel Warren: I do think it is a combination of tech and costs. There's regulatory elements here, too. We want to think about this from a holistic perspective. We know that EVs generally remain more expensive than comparable internal combustion engine vehicles, and I think at a time, as well, with high interest rates, affordability, it's a major barrier for the mass market. That's on top of the existing challenges we've seen. I do think range anxiety is a real thing. There is a real lack of confidence in the current public charging networks' reliability and availability. But I think it's really important to note. These automakers are not giving up on EVs entirely. They're really recalibrating their strategies, and I think that's to align with current market realities and consumer demand. It doesn't spell the end of EVs, but I do think that there is a certain extent to which we have to recalibrate our expectations for where this industry is going to grow in the next 5-10 years. We look at Ford. You mentioned that nearly $20 billion write-down. That's a massive charge to cancel several pure EV models. The fully electric version of the F-150 is being fully discontinued. They're going to be working on the F-150 Lightning extended-range electric vehicle. It uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery.\n\nTravis Hoium: That's really the trend is toward hybrids instead of pure EV.\nRachel Warren: Absolutely, and a lot of that, again, is really focusing on that lower-cost universal EV platform. Ford now expects their EV division is going to reach profitability by 2029. That is a three-year delay from their previous 2026 target. But I think that this is a trend that we're seeing across the industry. Don't discount the impact of regulatory elements, either. Major one was the $7,500 federal consumer tax credit that expired on September 30th. I think that is having an impact. It's really a perfect storm in some ways, but I also think that this means that we're just seeing shifts in where the EV industry is going, how it's evolving. It's not following maybe the trajectory that some analysts thought. But I do think that there is significant opportunity in this space for investors and for these auto makers, both traditional and otherwise, over the next decade.\n\nTravis Hoium: There's a lot of changes going on in electric vehicles, but what is Detroit maybe getting right? We'll talk about that when we come back. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nOne of the great things about Apple products is that it's really easy for us to handle the security, the updates, the pre-installed applications. We've been able to do that without a dedicated IT support team.\nWelcome back to Motley Fool Money. Detroit has gone from being all in on EVs to backing off. I want to focus on Detroit here first. We'll get to the full electric vehicle companies like Tesla and Lucid in just a second. But GM was really the first one to step back. They didn't make a big announcement like this, Lou, but they did pull back on their ambitions for electric vehicles. They've built their lines to be a little bit more flexible so you can build EV, or you can build a nice vehicle, or hybrid, anything in between. Ford has essentially said that his future is hybrid, at least for now. Is this a short-term strategy for these companies, or is this long-term the right thing for them to do?\n\nLou Whiteman: I think it's both. The nice thing about these companies is they have the scale. They have the balance sheets and the resources to do both, to have their cake and eat it too. I think it's right for right now, but it's also the right long-term strategy. Look, at the end of the day, they are trying to sell vehicles for a profit. Whether or not the power train doesn't matter. Ford is investing in hybrids because right now the hybrids is what they can do with a profit. We talked before about the Tech. The battery technology works a lot better in conjunction with a gas burning or a nice engine, or at least some lawn mower engine to keep it going. As the tech improves, as EVs improve, as batteries improve, it's only a half step to get there. They're not abandoning that. Look, I don't see this as giving up on EVs. I think this is recognizing the reality that we got ahead of ourselves, and what we can sell for a profit today is what we're going to focus on. Look, a lot of that effort, a lot of just the integrating batteries and battery power trains into automobiles, which they have to do with the EVs, that is at least halfway there to when EVs are ready. I think they'll be just fine long-term.\n\nTravis Hoium: Rachel, the other piece of this is that Detroit companies are making money. Ford, General Motors, they are profitable. Is this the right thing to say? You know what? That's the profitable piece of the business. We have competitors like Rivian, but they're losing money. Tesla, their margins are in decline. Volumes are in decline. We just heard that they have a four-month low in sales in the month of November. Maybe this is the right thing. If you were allocating capital today, maybe you would be putting that money into ICE vehicles or at least hybrids and not into EVs. Is that the right thing for Detroit?\nRachel Warren: I think so, at least for now, but I also want to note, Detroit is certainly looking at the future of EVs as different than maybe we thought a few years ago, but they're not giving up on EVs entirely. I think they're really more recognizing the current limitations of the existing market and putting those financial powerhouses and that manufacturing infrastructure to work rather than just scrapping that altogether. You have to think about that. The market for the initial wave of electric vehicles was made up of early adopters. The next phase really requires these companies to win over the more cost-conscious, the more skeptical consumers. But many current models they're very high-end, they're expensive. I think the current situation we're seeing indicates that the transition to EVs, it's more of a marathon in certain times than a sprint. Sales volumes are still growing globally. I will note this, particularly in China, but the rate of growth has slowed significantly compared to what many analysts were projecting a few years ago. I think the reality remains that there's a large segment of consumers that are hesitant. About pure EVs hybrids are more profitable for automakers than many fully electric models. They require less drastic changes to existing manufacturing processes and supply chains. We've heard from Ford's CEO Jim Farley in the past that hybrids shouldn't be viewed as just transitional technology, that they're a permanent part of a future lineup. I think that's the case, that contrasts a little bit from GM CEO Mary Barra. She said that hybrids are more of an interim solution. But I do think hybrids deserve really significant investment focus for at least the next several years until those next generation EVs become more affordable. I think that's a reality we're going to keep seeing from automakers, at least for the near term.\n\nTravis Hoium: I want to get a feeling on whether both of you are bullish or bearish on the future of Detroit. Lou, I'm going to have you go first.\nLou Whiteman: I'm bullish on the future, but don't take that as investment advice, because I don't want to own these companies.\nTravis Hoium: Even at a 5, 6, 7 PE ratio, they're just that attractive enough.\nLou Whiteman: But go back and find when they did much better than that. I think that there are natural limits to this business. There is not a more complex supply chain in all of industry. Back at forward, back in the day, $10 billion was zero. That way, if they got below $10 billion in cash on the balance [OVERLAPPING] sheet, and that speaks to the cash flow. The way money flows between suppliers to suppliers. This is just such a complex business, such a tough business. I think they are survivors, but over time, you have not in the long run beaten the market with these companies, and I don't see that changing, no matter what they're valued today. I think they are valued-based on the complexity of business, and I think there are easier ways to make money than investing in automakers.\n\nTravis Hoium: Rachel, are you bullish or bearish?\nRachel Warren: I would say I'm bullish, but I do tend to agree with Lou. The economics of these businesses don't particularly compel me as a long-term investor, and I do think that speaks to a lot of the mechanisms and complexities of how these businesses run. But I do think that there is a role for these companies to play in the long-term in the EV space. Overall, they are financially sound businesses, so that's something to know.\nLou Whiteman: What I think, Charles to note is whether or not we're right or wrong, we are speaking conventional wisdom, and you can be right by yourself, but if the market hates automakers, and so I think part of it is that even if your take is right and they are good values here, I don't trust that a critical mass in the market will agree with you and bid up the shares to make it worth the bet.\n\nRachel Warren: I think it's a great point.\nTravis Hoium: It'll be interesting to see over the past year, GM stock, this one that I follow more closely, up 58%, Tesla is only up 2%. Even over the past five years, Tesla's beating GM but only 124% to 92%. Depending on your time frame and how these companies do, eventually, making money seems like it matters. Lou is right that typically, the market does not like automakers, but they do still love EV makers. We're going to get to that next. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nWelcome back to Motley Fool Money. As much as EVs may be in decline right now, EVs' stocks certainly aren't, Tesla is one of the most valuable companies in the world. A $1.6 trillion valuation is recording. Rivian has been on a tear recently. They're worth over $20 billion. Is this segment of the market, can it live up to the hype in these valuations, Rachel? Or does Detroit actually have this right in that EV's maybe aren't the future right now, and we should be focusing elsewhere?\n\nRachel Warren: I think we need to be really careful with some of the hype that's surrounding a lot of these businesses. We do know that EVs look to be a part of the future. I think that's very much the case. But it's interesting to compare these models. I think a lot of people assume that traditional automakers would have a built-in advantage over these newer entrance to the EV space. That hasn't necessarily been the case. Traditional automakers have faced their own challenges, even though they are more financially bolstered, and we've seen a lot of these newer entrants, like the Rivians of the world, that are burning through cash. They're not profitable. They're struggling in their own way, but the market seems excited about them. I think we as investors need to take a really measured approach to understand where the opportunity lies. I think investors are betting on a lot of advancements in things like battery technology, software that could provide some very high-margin revenue streams for these businesses in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, as we've talked about, legacy automakers they're really focusing heavily on hybrids, and I think that one of the things when we take an example of these companies, you look at Tesla as a sustainably profitable business that essentially created the EV market. Tesla is often valued not just as a car company but as a tech and energy company. You look at Rivian, which has been on quite a tear up over the last year. They're still in the growth phase. They're not yet consistently profitable. They're operating at a net loss. I think you look at these valuations, it really represents a belief in the market of a substantial long-term shift in the global auto industry. Will that come to fruition? I think that remains to be seen.\n\nLou Whiteman: I think it's really important. Rachel, I think it's really important, though, to separate out Tesla from the rest of these companies because I do think it's different. Travis, as you said, Tesla sales are down, but they are also gaining market share in the US. [OVERLAPPING]\nTravis Hoium: That's because the EV space overall is shrinking.\nLou Whiteman: Exactly.\nTravis Hoium: Tesla is taking a bigger piece of a small.\nLou Whiteman: Elon said we think that actually the subsidy is going away. I might help us relative to competition. The reason for that is Tesla's just further along on the growth curve. They have cash in the bank. They have established sales channels, all of that. I do think Tesla is relatively fine. Look, and as far as the stock, this is a stock that Rachel says never traded on current day automotive, and you cannot begin to justify it based on current day automotive. It's always been about what is to come. It doesn't surprise me the stock is held up. I still think that there is a compelling bullcase that is a long-term case that isn't tied to current-day EV sales. As for the Rivians and the rest of the world, I am surprised the stocks have held up. We talked about before with some of the more diversified automakers, the power of a balance sheet, or the need for a balance sheet in this industry. This is a really cutthroat industry. They are younger than Tesla and not as established. They don't have the diverse product line, I think they need. I think this could be a problematic year for young companies that are still cash-starved. I might be selling Rivian short. Cost of good sales is going the right direction. Other metrics are going in the right direction. Maybe the market is right, and that they have gotten over the hump, and they can get through this time. I think that's possible. I just don't think it's a given, and I'm surprised at how excited the investors remain about this, given what I think are risks.\n\nTravis Hoium: You brought up scale earlier with the Detroit Automakers. That's one thing that Rivian has really struggled with. Their normal Illinois facility has never run at full capacity. They're upgrading some of their lines to be able to make the R2 there. There's going to be I think it's 215,000 units of capacity. Even when that's completed, that'll be in 2026. It's really hard to run the numbers to them to get to profitability with 215,000 units of capacity. They have to build a new facility in Georgia down the road from you. That's going to add 400,000 units. They don't have the cash to do that. That cash is debt that is supposed to be coming from the US government. This seems like a lot of things need to go right for these companies that, like you said, are not named Tesla because it's not just Rivian, Lucid's in the same boat. Basically, every other and a whole bunch of other companies have already fallen by the wayside. It seems like scale matters in this business. Detroit has it, and they're choosing to go away from EVs.\n\nLou Whiteman: I think that's all fair. I will say the one thing, and maybe this is wish casting. But there's a lot of some costs. You mentioned Georgia. There's a lot of investment from Georgia. These are long-term projects. We could have elections before things really come to shove and I think in our case with Rivian, the state of Georgia is invested, so there might be more levers than a skeptic who might want to short the stock would think, which is why I wouldn't short it either. But yes, I think if nothing else, I'm surprised it's not trading based on at least some of the potential headwinds or potential risk out there because they do look significant to me.\nTravis Hoium: Well, Detroit is definitely placing their bets, but investors still think EVs are the future, so we'll see how this one plays out. Obviously, something to watch because this is a big jobs driver. Is a huge expense for people. Depending on what happens with consumers, 2026 is going to be a big year.

      "Content": "Tesla (TSLA) Declines More Than Market: Some Information for Investors\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nIn the latest trading session, Tesla (TSLA) closed at $475.19, marking a -2.1% move from the previous day. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.03%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.04%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.09%.\nThe electric car maker's shares have seen an increase of 13.79% over the last month, surpassing the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 12.09% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.57%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Tesla in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, Tesla is projected to report earnings of $0.46 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 36.99%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $24.76 billion, down 3.7% from the prior-year quarter.\nTSLA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $1.63 per share and revenue of $94.76 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -32.64% and -3%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Tesla. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.02% lower. At present, Tesla boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn the context of valuation, Tesla is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 297.94. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 16.69, which means Tesla is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nWe can also see that TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 8.51. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Automotive - Domestic industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.97.\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 76, finds itself in the top 31% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "From Tesla To Nike: Why Tim Cook's Buy Is Drawing Market Parallels\n\nSurbhi Jain\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNKE\n\nAAPL\n\nMarket bottoms rarely arrive with reassurance. They show up when skepticism turns casual — when stocks stop being debated and start being dismissed. That's the backdrop against which Apple Inc ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook 's purchase of Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) shares is suddenly getting serious attention .\n\nEarlier this year, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) found its footing just as public commentary around the stock turned openly mocking, including a high-profile jab from Tim Walz . The remark didn't cause the bottom — but it coincided with a moment when pessimism appeared fully priced in. Tesla didn't explode higher overnight. It simply stopped going down. And that was the tell.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nPeak Skepticism Setup Nike now sits in a similarly uncomfortable place. The stock has spent months under pressure from margin concerns, inventory cleanups, and questions around consumer demand. Expectations are low. Sentiment is thin. The narrative has grown tired. The shares are down over 18% YTD.\nThat's what makes Tim Cook's personal purchase of roughly $3 million worth of Nike shares stand out. Not the size — the timing.\n\nWhy This Buy Matters Cook isn't a Nike insider. He isn't required to buy. And he isn't known for tactical trades. When someone with his profile steps into a struggling consumer name, markets naturally ask whether downside risk is becoming asymmetric.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThis isn't a call that Nike's problems are solved. Execution still matters, and fundamentals will ultimately decide the outcome. But selective, high-profile buying tends to show up closer to inflection points than to peaks.\nTesla's Quiet Lesson Tesla's bottom earlier this year offered a simple reminder: markets often turn when confidence looks misplaced and skepticism sounds effortless. Nike may not follow the same script — but Tim Cook's move suggests the risk-reward conversation has shifted.\nAnd when that happens, the story usually changes before the stock does.\nRead Next:\nBuffett's Secret to Wealth?

The reportedly 20.6 billion cash deal highlights collaboration between the AI chip innovators amid surging demand for efficient inference solutions.\n\nGroq To Remain An Independent Company Groq has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia covering its inference technology. Groq reports the pact focuses on expanding access to high-performance, low-cost inference capabilities.

I hope your Christmas Day celebrations were merry and joyful. Next up: New Year’s Eve and 2026.\nAs I considered what to write for today’s commentary on unusual options activity, it occurred to me that I would be writing before Christmas Day, so I needed a subject that was backward-looking yet still interesting to readers.\n\nMore News from Barchart Have a MERRY Christmas With These 9 Unusually Active Options\nHere’s a Smart Way to Trade Robinhood (HOOD) Stock Without Going into Lottery Mode\nCisco Systems Stock Is Treading Water - How to Use Puts and Calls to Play CSCO\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nI like to look back from time to time to see how past option strategies played out, regardless of their success. Accountability is vital for every investor, myself included.\nLooking at the unusual options activity from Nov. 26, I noticed that Tesla (TSLA), Robinhood Markets (HOOD), and FedEx (FDX) had put options expiring in 30 days on Dec. 26 that generated significant income for those who sold them short.\nAs a result, I’ve decided to look ahead 30 days to see whether these same three stocks can deliver a repeat performance. Here’s what I found.\nHave an excellent weekend!\nThe TSLA, HOOD, and FDX Put Options From Nov. 26 First up is the Tesla Dec. 26 $390 put with a bid price of $8.15. The Vol/OI (volume-to-open interest) ratio was 1.39, above the 1.24 cutoff. Tesla’s closing price on Nov. 26 was $426.58. As of Dec. 23, it was up 13.8% over the previous 18 trading days.\nWith a short day on the 24th, closed on Christmas Day, and a full day on the 26th, the $8.15 in premium income from selling the put would generate an annualized return of 25.55% [$8.15 bid price / $390 strike price - $8.15 bid price * 365 / 30 days]. The income is secure, and the shares are unlikely to be subject to assignment.\nSuccess.\nNext up is Robinhood Markets. In this case, there were two to choose from. The $115 put was 11.5% OTM (out of the money), whereas the $120 was OTM by 6.8%. When selling puts, I look for strikes 10% or more OTM to provide a margin of safety.\nWith the share price closing at $120.24 on Dec. 23, the margin of safety on the $115 strike would be helpful. However, the share price is down nearly 22% since hitting an all-time high of $153.86 in early October, so it’s unlikely to be deep ITM (in the money) at the Dec. 26 expiration.\nWorst-case scenario on the $120 strike: you’re assigned the shares, buying them at $114.85 [$120 strike price - $5.15 bid price], a much better entry point than two-and-a-half months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the $115 strike, your annualized return of 40.3% [$3.65 bid price / $115 strike price - $3.65 bid price * 365 / 30 days] is very healthy. Not as plentiful as the 54.9% annualized return for the $120 strike [$5.15 bid price / $120 strike price - $5.15 bid price * 365 / 30 days], but reasonable nonetheless.\nLastly, we have the FedEx $270 put with a bid price of $9.10. The Vol/OI ratio was 1.33. FedEx’s closing price on Nov. 26 was $275.83. As of Dec. 23, it was up 7.0% over the previous 18 trading days. It’s unlikely that its share price will drop below $270 before Friday’s close. The put’s annualized return is 42.6% [$9.10 bid price / $270 strike price - $9.10 bid price * 365 / 30 days].\n\nBased on $2,240 in premium income (using $120 strike) and $78,000 in cash held for the secured puts, the average annualized return is 35.4%.\nI like it.\nCan We Beat 35%? I don’t see why not. I’m being facetious. It’s not easy to consistently generate 35% annualized returns from selling puts--but we’ll try just the same.\nTesla should be the easiest to deliver a good return because of its massive options volume—its 30-day average is 2.28 million, compared to 277,050 for HOOD and 14,910 for FDX. I guess we’ll see.\n\nThe $390 strike from the previous section has a bid price, as I write this, of $1.86 based on a 31-day DTE (days to expiration). That’s an annualized return of 5.6%, considerably less than the 25.55% return from the 30 days between Nov. 26 and Dec. 23. We’ll have to move closer to the money.\nThe Jan. 23/2026 $455 put has an annualized return of 29.3%. That’s great, but the Vol/OI ratio is just 0.14, well below the 1.24 cutoff.\nDue to limited choice, I'll have to use a different DTE. The Jan. 9/2026 $457.50 put expires in 17 days from Dec. 23 with a bid price of $6.25, an annualized return of 29.7%, and a Vol/OI ratio of 9.45.\nOTM by 5.46%, the profit probability remains high, at 78.19%. I may have to use Jan. 9/2026 puts for HOOD and FDX.\nIt won't be easy to find a put OTM that will generate a nearly 55% annualized return like the Dec. 26 $120 put. The best I can do—keeping in mind I’m looking for unusual options activity—is the Jan. 7/2026 $107 put.\nIt has a bid price of $1.04, an annualized return of 21.1%, and a 3.43 Vol/OI ratio. More importantly, an 86.05% probability of profit means there’s a good chance the share price will be above the $105.96 breakeven in 17 days.\nLastly, and the toughest of the three, is FedEx. I don’t see any of the put strike prices for Jan. 9/2026 having Vol/OI ratios above 1.24. The remaining January expiration dates also show low volume.\n\nFedEx is out for income generation in January.\nThe Bottom Line Result Reducing the DTE to 17 days from 30 has enabled me to find reasonable annualized returns of 29.7% and 21.1% for Tesla and Robinhood, respectively.\nBased on $729 in premium income and $56,450 in cash held for the secured puts, the average annualized return would be 27.7%, 770 basis points lower than the returns generated by the three stocks over the past 30 days.\nWhile disappointing, given FedEx’s low options volume, the outcome was somewhat predictable.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Tesla’s (TSLA) stock four years ago, it would be worth about $13,700 today, thanks to a 37% price gain since late December 2021.\nThat’s a solid profit, but it falls well short of the massive returns you’d have gotten with other high-profile stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) or Alphabet (GOOG). The next four years could be a lot more lucrative for Tesla investors — or a lot worse.\n\nWhat could a $10,000 Tesla investment today look like by 2030? Here’s what a couple of experts had to say.\nAlso see the Tesla investing mistake that could cost you thousands .\nThe Bull Case A $10,000 investment in Tesla today could be worth twice that much by 2030 if the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle (EV) maker reaches certain benchmarks, according to Chad Cummings, an attorney and certified public accountant (CPA) at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax.\n\nBut for that to happen, a lot of things would have to go the right way.\n“If Tesla scales its energy storage segment and increases paid software penetration above current rates, [its] position could exceed $20,000,” Cummings told GOBankingRates. “The S&P 500 at an 8% compound rate places the same $10,000 near $15,900, which is the realistic hurdle Tesla must beat. Even so, there are some major headwinds.”\nThose headwinds include “litigation and regulatory exposure” that could drive Tesla’s downside more than macro trends, according to Cummings.\n“A single autonomous-related fatality that triggers a regulatory halt can cut Tesla’s valuation by tens of billions within days,” he said. “The insurance and legal systems still have yet to fully price in autonomous driving and the results, which creates something of a hot potato.”\n\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nLooking Beyond the EV Market Another thing to keep an eye on is how Tesla’s non-EV businesses perform over the next few years — mainly its energy generation/storage and other services. These businesses are considered by many to be the stock’s main growth drivers.\n“A $10,000 investment in Tesla right now depends less on the EV side than people think,” said Edward Corona, founder of The Options Oracle AI Trade Manager . “I honestly don’t believe Tesla’s main focus is cars anymore — but they still need the car business to keep the money flowing while they build everything else. And Elon has about one trillion reasons now to make sure the long-term plan pays off.”\nThe “one trillion reasons” comment refers to Musk’s new compensation package , which could be worth about $1 trillion if certain milestones are met.\n\nStory Continues\nBy 2030, a $10,000 investment will “come down to whether Tesla can use the EV side to fund the bigger vision without letting margins fall apart,” Corona told GOBankingRates. “If they balance that right, the stock could look a lot different in a few years. If they don’t, investors will feel it. Tesla’s future isn’t about selling cars — it’s about whether the rest of the plan actually gets executed.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s shares are up by 28% year-to-date and by 39% since September 10th. December has seen several analysts focus on the firm. On the 19th, Deutsche Bank raised Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s share price target to $500 from $470 and reiterated a Buy rating. The bank pointed out that while it expects weak delivery figures for the fourth quarter, the overall narrative for robotaxi was robust. On the same day, Truist also raised its share price target for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). It set the new price target at $444, up from an earlier $406, and kept a Hold rating. Like Deutsche, Truist pointed out that the firm’s autonomy initiatives and the robotaxi will play a key role in its valuation. However, an interesting share by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) on November 13th outlined the firm’s plans to use its Megapack batteries to power data centers. The release provided exposure to the firm when it came to the AI data center buildout in the US. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) outlined that AI model training runs that used GPUs could fluctuate by as much as 90% and the Megapacks would help with it. The announcement hasn’t gone unnoticed by Jim Cramer’s radar either, as the CNBC TV host commented:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Electrek was the first to report on the move, which seems to be an effort to cut down on Tesla's expanding stock of Cybertrucks since sales have been underwhelming.Tesla could make between $80 million and $160 million in internal sales from the trucks, which cost $80,000 apiece. Even while there was a lot of enthusiasm at first and more than a million preorders in 2019, just around 60,000 of those reservations have turned into real sales.Some people say that the deal between companies shows how hard it is for Tesla to satisfy expectations for the Cybertruck, which has gotten a lot of criticism for its price, range, and design revisions since it came out. Some people also wondered whether it was right for SpaceX, which gets government contracts, to acquire cars that weren't marketed by another Musk-owned firm.\nWarning!

Renner\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:46 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nA caller from Roanoke, Virginia, told \"The Ramsey Show\" that she is working two jobs while carrying $258,000 in student loan debt at age 59. LaRhonda said her primary job pays about $60,000 a year and that she also has a mortgage. She asked whether there was any way to make the student loan balance \"go away.\"\n\n\"Good Lord,\" personal finance expert Dave Ramsey said after confirming her age.\nThree Degrees And A Growing Balance LaRhonda told the hosts about her educational background. She said she holds three degrees: a bachelor's degree in multidisciplinary studies focused on criminal justice and religion, a master's degree in accounting, and a master's degree in divinity with a focus on theology and homiletics.\n\nDon't Miss:\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nShe said that much of the debt came from the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students, which she took out to pay for her son's college education.\nA Career That Took A Different Turn With that context, Ramsey asked why someone with a master's degree in accounting was earning about $60,000 a year. LaRhonda said accounting jobs she explored in her area paid less than her current position.\nWhen co-host George Kamel asked whether she was working in accounting, LaRhonda said she was not. She said she works in logistics as a logistics specialist at Volvo Trucks.\n\nKamel questioned how her degrees were being used and said her current role was in logistics rather than accounting or divinity. Ramsey added that accounting skills can apply in logistics but said her multidisciplinary criminal justice degree was not part of her work.\nReferring to her age and loan balance, Ramsey said the numbers were \"disturbing\" and told her she had \"not monetized your knowledge base very well.\"\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nThe Income Gap Comes Into Focus The discussion then shifted to income. Ramsey said the debt itself was not the main issue and that the figures do not work at her current income level. He said many people with a master's degree in accounting earn six figures, often starting between $100,000 and $125,000, and said moving into higher-paying roles would be required.\n\"I'd like you to be at 120 heading towards 220,\" Ramsey said. He added that Roanoke is \"not a backward town\" and said the area could support higher-paying roles. He also said supply chain positions generally pay more than $60,000.\n\nStory Continues\nLaRhonda said employers she spoke with expected experience using accounting software such as SAP, a widely used accounting and enterprise software system. She said her coursework emphasized manual accounting methods rather than software-based systems.\nRamsey responded that accounting has been computer-driven for decades and said learning those systems would be necessary. He told her that at this stage of her career, increasing income is the only way the math works and said she must push hard into higher-earning opportunities, a shift he described as the point where someone must \"leave the cave, kill something\" to change their financial trajectory.\n\nRead Next:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "Waymo Expands Robotaxi Footprint as 2026 Becomes a Crucial Test\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBloomberg reporting suggests Waymo's accelerating expansion could mark an important phase in testing whether autonomous ride-hailing can develop into a viable, potentially profitable business at scale. After operating robotaxis in cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, Waymo has said it is targeting more than 1 million rides per week by the end of next year, a level it has already reached on a monthly basis since the spring. Bloomberg News has also reported that Waymo is in talks to raise funds at a valuation near $100 billion, which would roughly double its valuation from a year earlier, alongside an annual revenue run rate above $350 million. As of recent public disclosures, Waymo is permitted to or testing its technology in 26 of the top 30 US metro areas and plans to launch in 12 additional cities in 2026, including London, with early deployments expected to remain limited in size.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe expansion reflects a partnership-led approach that could help manage costs and operational complexity as the business scales. Waymo expanded into Austin and Atlanta in 2025 with Uber ( NYSE:UBER ), bringing its commercial presence to five cities, and has worked with Uber-backed fleet managers on tasks such as cleaning, charging, and maintenance. Future launches are expected to introduce additional partners, including Lyft in Nashville and Avis Budget Group in Dallas. Gaining exposure to multiple geographies, regulatory regimes, and operating models could give Waymo useful insights as it competes with rivals such as Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Amazon's Zoox, which have also introduced robotaxi services at a smaller scale. Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai has said internally that the business is not expected to be financially meaningful to the parent company until 202728.\n\nAs Waymo has scaled, Bloomberg reporting indicates the company has encountered operational and technical challenges that highlight remaining uncertainties. These have included so-called edge cases such as interactions with stopped school buses, police activity, and incorrect turns, as well as a temporary suspension of service during a major San Francisco power outage when vehicles became immobilized. Waymo has said its data show significantly fewer pedestrian injury crashes than human drivers and that safety remains central to its strategy. Other developers are also preparing customer-facing launches in 2026, with Lucid and Nuro planning to offer self-driving vehicles for Uber riders in San Francisco and additional global markets. With multiple deployments expected next year, 2026 could provide clearer signals on whether robotaxi technology can translate into sustainable earnings over time.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "From pandemic to AI boom: The new reality of global supply chains\n\nRob Lenihan\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:19 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nElon Musk probably said it best when the Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO declared, “the supply chain stuff is really tricky.”\nOh, you’d better believe it.\nThe supply chain—the network of people, organizations, and information that moves a product or service from its origin to the final customer—is crucial to the world’s economy, as it ensures efficiency and lowers costs.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed just how fragile global supply chains are.\n“For decades, we have grown accustomed to ever quicker deliveries with increasing methods of tracking,” said David Dreyfus, Rutgers Business School supply chain management professor. “Two-day deliveries, free returns, and omni-channel retailing have become the norm.”\nSo, he asked, what happened during this pandemic that caused our supply chains to play out of tune?\n“You may remember that we ran short of ventilators, personal protection equipment, toilet paper, and computer chips,” Dreyfus wrote in a chapter of Reflections on the Pandemic: Covid and Social Crises in the Year Everything Changed .\n“Instead of an isolated disruption, as is usually the case amid a natural disaster or war, this pandemic occurred almost simultaneously around the world.”\n\nDreyfus said the pandemic revealed the level of globalization and complexity of our modern supply chains—as well as the fragility.\n“When any part of this chain breaks, disruptions are likely to follow,” he said. “War and inflation offer new disruptions. Better and more robust supply chain management principles should be adopted.”\nAI boom pressures supply chain “Ultimately, our quest to manage the risk within businesses continues,” Dreyfus said.\nThe world’s economy has largely recovered from the pandemic, but supply chain concerns still linger.\nMore on the tech industry:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nThe semiconductor industry's revenue is projected to hit record highs in 2025, with the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) calling for global chip sales to hit $700.9 billion.\nThis is one giant step toward the industry’s goal of $1 trillion in annual chip sales by 2030, and it is being driven primarily by booming demand for AI chips, data centers, automotive electronics, and consumer electronics.\nHowever, industry executives are concerned about supply chain stability, energy security, and talent shortages, according to the 21st annual Global Semiconductor Outlook by KPMG LLP and the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA).\n\nStory Continues\nFueled by the AI boom, 93% of industry leaders expect revenue growth in 2026, but the bullish outlook is tempered by significant operational and geopolitical risks.\nFor the first time, KPMG stated that leaders now rank tariffs and trade policy as their top concern, and some fear they may not be able to procure sufficient energy to power their advanced chip manufacturing facilities.\n\n“We're seeing a fundamental surge in semiconductor demand that spans the entire economy—from AI and data centers to electric vehicles,” Chad Seiler, Line of Business Leader, Technology, Media and Telecom at KPMG US, said in a statement.\n“This broad-based demand creates a more resilient growth trajectory, but it also creates intense pressure.”\nThe survey is based upon the opinions of 151 executives, over half of whom are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.\n“Leaders are now faced with the challenge of capitalizing on this historic opportunity while simultaneously navigating supply chain, energy and talent challenges,” Seiler added.\nPresident Donald Trump’s tariff regimen also seriously rattled the world’s supply chains.\nThe chip sector had to contend with increased costs and supply chain reconfigurations, which created uncertainty and led to higher prices for tech products as companies tried to avoid tariffs by investing in new locations or redesigning products to use local components.\n\nAI can aid supply chain planning While fabless and IP companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) are thriving, Infosys said that integrated device manufacturers and equipment suppliers may face contraction due to supply chain disruptions and cost pressures.\nGeopolitical tensions are disrupting global supply chains, introducing trade barriers, export controls, and shifting production priorities, which in turn create uncertain and rising costs, according to the digital consulting and services firm.\n\nRelated: RTO mandates to AI agents: How work is changing in 2026 and beyond\n“Upstream challenges, such as shortages of neon gas and rare earth metals, are worsened by geopolitical risks—from the war in Ukraine to China’s export restrictions,” Infosys said.\n“Additionally, delays in new fab construction, such as TSMC's Arizona facility that is now rescheduled for 2028, have intensified supply concerns.”\nThe firm said companies with a robust talent pipeline and resilient supply chains “will be best positioned to navigate these complexities and drive long-term success through 2030.”\n“Companies are diversifying supply chains, forming strategic partnerships, and leveraging AI-driven forecasting,” Infosys said.\n“At the same time, the focus on domestic semiconductor production is increasing. While this shift offers opportunities for resilience and innovation, it also introduces risks of fragmentation and geopolitical tensions.”\n\nAI can be used across the entire supply chain, according to Haslam College of Businesses’ Global Supply Chain Institute .\n“Transportation and logistics companies use AI technology and predictive analytics to help with route planning to enhance productivity and decrease costs,” the institute said on its website.\n“By analyzing factors like traffic, weather, and transportation networks, AI helps companies find the fastest routes, saving time and money. AI can also maximize cargo space to ensure trucks are loaded as efficiently as possible to save on fuel.”\nRelated: AI growth strains electrical grid as tech companies expand operations\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 26, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

      "Content": "Tesla Under Scrutiny Due to Model 3 Door Release Concerns\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKAR\n\nOPLN\n\nGM\n\nTesla, Inc. TSLA is under scrutiny after the U.S. auto safety regulator launched a defect investigation into Model 3 compact sedans, citing concerns that emergency door release controls may be difficult to access or identify in critical situations.\n\nPer the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the probe covers about 179,071 model year 2022 vehicles. It was initiated on Dec. 23 following a defect petition alleging that the mechanical door release is concealed, unlabeled and not intuitive to locate during emergencies.\n\nThe automaker primarily uses electronic door latches that operate via buttons instead of conventional mechanical handles. Although the vehicles are equipped with manual door releases for emergencies or power outages, safety experts have long warned that these releases are not consistently visible, clearly labeled or easy to find, especially for rear-seat passengers.\n\nOpening a defect investigation does not automatically result in a recall, but it represents the first stage of a regulatory review that could lead to further action if a safety-related defect is identified.\n\nThis marks the second probe this year into Tesla&rsquo;s door handles. In September, the NHTSA opened an investigation into the 2021 Model Y SUV, affecting roughly 174,000 vehicles, after reports that parents were unable to open the electric doors to reach their children following drives. In four cases, parents reportedly broke the vehicle&rsquo;s windows to rescue their children.\n\nTesla&rsquo;s Zacks Rank & Key Picks TSLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the auto space are General Motors Company GM, OPENLANE, Inc.

( NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock recently reached an all-time high. After wavering earlier this year, it is up 120% over the past five years. That compares to the S&P 500’s gain of 87% in that time. This is despite slow sales, battles over CEO Elon Musk’s pay package, electric vehicle (EV) competition, and safety concerns about some of its models. Investors still believe Tesla’s future is as something more than a car company. In fact, much of the five-year increase happened in the second half of 2025.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock recently reached an all-time high and has outperformed the broader market over the past five years.\nInvestor optimism centers on Tesla becoming a leader in self-driving taxis and robotics.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThere is only one explanation for the success of the shares. People and institutions that own the stock believe that Musk’s vision of a future in which its primary businesses are fully self-driving cars and robotics will make it a global artificial intelligence (AI) leader.\nMusk has made believers of what must be tens of thousands of shareholders with his story that there will be 40 million human-like robots in 2040. The price of these could be less than $20,000. That makes it hard to see how these could be affordable in the world’s poor countries.\nWhile Tesla has many competitors in the autonomous car business, Musk says it will be the worldwide leader. That means his service will need to be better than several in the United States, including Alphabet’s Waymo. The New York Times recently reported, “Shares of Tesla have hit new highs on optimism about the company’s self-driving taxis. But experts say Tesla is far behind Waymo, which has a big head start.” Several tech and car companies in China also say they have a head start.\n\nMost car industry experts do believe self-driving cars are the future of the auto and trucking sectors. How soon and who wins are part of an ongoing debate that will be settled by the market share of the companies already far along in the business.\nOften missing in the debate is that some legacy car company stocks have done nearly as well as Tesla over the past five years. General Motors Co. ( NYSE: GM ) stock is up by 102%. Maybe just being a car company is enough to have a strong share price performance.\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nStory Continues\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nTesla (TSLA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this electric car maker have returned +13.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has gained 14.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share, indicating a change of -37% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.8% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.63 points to a change of -32.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.31 indicates a change of +42% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.7%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $24.76 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -3.7%. The $94.76 billion and $105.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3% and +11.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Tesla reported revenues of $28.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.6%. EPS of $0.5 for the same period compares with $0.72 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was -5.66%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk commented on the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions on five European officials, including former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton , a long-time critic who previously clashed with Musk over content regulation.\n“Tyranny Breton gets his dessert,” Musk posted on X, responding to reports of the U.S. travel bans.\nDon't Miss:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nDuring his tenure as EU Commissioner, Thierry Breton called on Musk to enforce the European Union's Digital Services Act , which sets EU-wide rules for online intermediaries such as social media platforms, marketplaces, and app stores, regarding online content moderation and platform responsibilities.\n\nEU Response The European Commission has condemned the U.S. decision. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States,\" the Commission stated.\nThe Commission emphasized on its sovereign right to regulate economic activity and said EU digital rules ensure a safe and fair environment for all companies.\n\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nIt has also requested clarifications from U.S. authorities and vowed to respond decisively to defend its regulatory autonomy.\nEU Council President Antonio Costa criticized the measures, calling them \"unacceptable between allies, partners, and friends.\"\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-recent-uk-megapack-deal-132000065.html",
      "Content": "Tesla's Recent UK Megapack Deal to Supercharge Its Energy Business\n\nRimmi Singhi\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla TSLA has secured a 1 GWh Megapack project with Matrix Renewables in Scotland. The project will be built in Eccles and will use a 500 MW, two-hour standalone battery energy storage system. For Matrix Renewables, this will be its first standalone battery storage project in the UK. For Tesla, it is another clear win in a market that has quietly become one of its strongest for energy storage.\n\nWhy the UK Deal Matters The UK grid is turning into a real-world test case for renewable power. As the country pushes toward its Net Zero 2050 goal and Clean Power 2035 ambition, it needs reliable ways to balance intermittent solar and wind generation. That is exactly where Tesla’s Megapack comes in. Large-scale batteries allow utilities to store excess energy when supply is high and release it when demand spikes. This makes renewables far more practical at scale.\n\nThe company has been ramping up production at its Lathrop Megafactory in California specifically to meet growing global demand for grid-scale storage. Last year, Tesla landed a massive multi-billion-dollar contract to deploy more than 15 GWh of Megapacks for Intersect Power in California.\nTesla Energy Is Doing What EVs Aren’t Right Now While Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) business is dealing with softer demand and pricing pressure, its energy segment is doing the opposite. Projects like this highlight why Tesla Energy and storage have become a bright spot for the company. This is thanks to the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products — lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall is designed to store energy for homes and small commercial facilities, while Megapack serves larger-scale energy needs for commercial, industrial and utility customers.\n\nThe numbers behind Tesla Energy are hard to ignore. Energy storage deployments have surged at a compound annual growth rate of 180% over the past three years. In 2024 alone, deployments jumped 113% year over year. CEO Musk expects deployments to grow another 50% at least for the full year. In the third quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage, up 81% year over year.\nJust as important, this growth is profitable. Tesla Energy became profitable in mid-2022 and has now delivered profits for 14 straight quarters. In 2024, the Energy Generation and Storage segment posted gross margins of 26%, the highest across Tesla’s businesses. Lower material costs and operating leverage are helping keep margins strong.\nAs power grids strain and renewables expand, Tesla’s energy business is becoming a core pillar — and right now, it may be the company’s most reliable source of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTSLA’s Competitors in This Space Fluence Energy FLNC and Enphase Energy ENPH are key competitors to Tesla’s energy and storage business.\nVirginia-based Fluence Energy is one of the global leaders in utility-scale energy storage and a direct competitor to Tesla’s Megapack. The company operates in a fast-growing market, driven by the global shift toward renewable energy. Fluence provides large-scale battery systems, AI-driven software, and grid services to utilities and energy developers worldwide. Its new Smartstack platform and partnership with Cordelio Power to deploy 1 GWh of domestically manufactured battery storage further strengthen its competitive position.\n\nEnphase Energy, headquartered in Fremont, CA, competes more closely with Tesla in the residential energy storage market. The company designs and sells home energy solutions that integrate energy generation, storage, monitoring, and control into a single intelligent platform. Known for its solar microinverters, Enphase has expanded into home battery systems, offering solar-plus-storage solutions that help homeowners reduce reliance on the grid and better manage energy consumption.\nTSLA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Tesla have gained around 12% over the past year, underperforming the industry.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, TSLA trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 15.27, way above the industry. It carries a Value Score of D.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSee how the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA's EPS has been revised over the past 90 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Will Rivian (RIVN) Stock Hit $50 by 2030?\n\nDavid Moadel\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:58 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nQuick Read Rivian Automotive’s (RIVN) revenue grew 78.3% year-over-year in Q3 2025, but its net loss increased by 6%.\nSince Rivian’s future growth depends heavily on unknown R2 SUV sales, it’s too soon to invest in RIVN stock with confidence.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIf you missed out on the multi-decade returns of Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) stock, maybe you'll get a second chance with electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive ( NASDAQ:RIVN ). For the next four to five years, some loyal RIVN stockholders hope to achieve Tesla-like growth.\nIn the most optimistic scenario, Rivian stock would stage a spectacular comeback and rally to $50 by 2030. However, in a more pessimistic scenario, Rivian could run out of money next year and file for bankruptcy.\nNo one knows for sure whether RIVN stock will become a hero or a zero by 2030. Still, you could have a huge winner on your hands with a share position in Rivian, so let's see what's under the hood with this fascinating EV producer.\nIs Rivian Stock the \"Comeback Kid\"? Whether Rivian stock is \"dead money\" or the \"comeback kid\" largely depends on your time frame. If your lookback period is five years, then the \"dead money\" theory seems to hold up.\nAlarmingly, RIVN stock has lost 80% of its value during the past five years. But then, the picture looks much brighter if we zoom in on the past 12 months.\n\nNow, the \"comeback kid\" theory is in effect as Rivian stock has gained 54% over the past year. In theory, if the stock continues to add 50% every year through 2030, then a $50 is an easy target price.\nThat's a highly ambitious projection, though. To be more informed and realistic, we need to delve into Rivian's actual results, so we'll do that right now.\nNo Imminent Danger After performing an inspection of Rivian's third-quarter 2025 results, we'll find that it's a good-news, bad-news situation. The good news is that Rivian's revenue surged 78.3% from $874 million in the year-earlier quarter to $1.558 billion in Q3 2025.\nOn the other hand, Rivian's cost of revenue and operating expenses also grew during that period. Consequently, the company's net loss increased 6% year-over-year, from $1.1 billion to $1.167 billion.\nFurthermore, Rivian's cash and cash equivalents declined from $5.294 billion as of December 31, 2024, to $4.441 billion as of September 30, 2025. It appears, then, that the company's capital position is dwindling but at least Rivian isn't in immediate danger of running of out cash.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's understandable that Rivian needs to spend money in the short term. For example, the company recently developed its artificial intelligence (AI) infused Rivian Autonomy Platform, which \"has been designed around an AI-centric end-to-end approach.\"\nThat said, we can't disregard the fact that Rivian is still a money-losing operation. Until the company's capital outlays on AI technology and other investments translate to substantial profits, it may be difficult to invest in Rivian with complete confidence.\n\nIt's All About the R2 Now Although Rivian offers an R1T electric pickup truck, the automaker's future will evidently \"ride or die\" on the upcoming R2 SUV model. By all indications, Rivian's success or failure through 2030 could depend on the R2.\nIn the company's Q3 2025 press release, Rivian declared that the R2 model's \"progress remains on track for deliveries in the first half of 2026.\" A great deal of buzz on financial social media appears to be centered around this much-hyped SUV launch.\n\nIn other words, if Rivian's R2 launch next year is a letdown, it will be quite difficult for RIVN stock to hit $50 by 2030. Indeed, the next four to five years could be painful for Rivian's loyal shareholders.\nFor what it's worth, Car and Driver 's write-up on the upcoming Rivian R2 makes the SUV model sound highly appealing. With a starting price of $45,000, the R2 might actually be able to compete with Tesla's Model Y.\nIn case you're curious, the longest-range R2 is expected to provide more than 300 miles of range. Also, one version of the R2 is anticipated to accelerate to 60 miles per hour in under 3 seconds.\nDon't Get Your Hopes Up The range and speed stats for Rivian's R2 SUV are all well and good, but they don't guarantee strong sales. For all we know, next year's R2 launch could be a success or a bust.\nFrankly, it's worrisome that the R2 launch will be, to a certain extent, make-or-break for Rivian in 2026. If the R2 gets off on the wrong foot, Rivian's path to recovery through 2030 will be unclear.\n\nThus, without the R2 sales data in hand right now, it's too optimistic to expect RIVN stock to zoom from its current price of around $21 to $50 by 2030. Rivian isn't in imminent risk of bankruptcy, but the wise move is to keep your position size in Rivian stock small if you choose to invest at all.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Futures associated with the Dow were lower by nearly 0.2% in early trading, while those tied to the S&P 500 were fractionally lower. Futures tracking the Nasdaq crept higher. U.S. benchmark crude oil futures were at nearly $58.50 a barrel as the commodity stayed near two-week highs. Bitcoin traded at $88,600, higher than the $87,400 it hit on Wednesday. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a range of consumer loans, were at 4.14%, ticking higher from Wednesday’s levels.\n\nGold, Silver Extend Streak of Highs Gold and silver again touched record highs on Friday as the precious metals continued to see their prices rise. Gold futures were trading around $4543.50 an ounce after earlier pressing as high as $4561.60. Silver futures were at $75.67 an ounce recently after earlier reaching a new high of $75.84. Precious metals continued to add value in December, with silver rising by more than 27% this month and gold adding more than 6%. Silver has more than doubled in value this year, while gold is up by more than 70%. Investors have been pouring into the safe-haven assets as investors anticipate lower interest rates and central banks have been adding to their holdings.\n\nNvidia to Buy Assets from AI Startup Groq Nvidia ( NVDA ) has made a deal with artificial intelligence startup Groq, according to news reports and a post on the startup’s site. Groq in a statement said that Nvidia entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the startup’s inference technology.“The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low cost inference,” it said. CNBC reported that the deal include an asset purchase worth $20 billion in cash, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led a $750 million fundraising round for the startup.The move comes as AI stocks have been moving higher to end the year. Nvidia shares were higher by 0.6% in premarket trading.\n\nStory Continues\nFederal Regulators Probe Tesla Door Release Issue The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it earlier this week opened an investigation into Tesla ( TSLA ) after it received a petition saying the mechanical door release for the 2022 Tesla Model 3 wasn’t easily accessible. “The petition cites allegations that the mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive to locate during an emergency,” the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation said. The issue is expected to affect about 179,000 vehicles. The NHTSA had opened other investigations into Tesla , including a probe on electronic door lock issues with a different model. Tesla shares ticked higher in premarket trading.\nNike Shares Continue Rise After Apple CEO Stock Purchase Nike ( NKE ) shares continued to rise in premarket trading after the athletic apparel maker helped lead stocks higher in Wednesday’s session. Nike shares gained 4.6% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of Nike's board, bought nearly $3 million worth of the company’s stock. Despite the surge, Nike shares are lower by 20% so far this year. Nike shares were higher by nearly 0.4% in premarket trading.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "US Safety Regulator Opens New Probe Into Tesla Model 3 Doors\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:41 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nTesla Inc. ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) is facing renewed regulatory attention after US auto safety officials said they are evaluating complaints tied to emergency door releases in certain Model 3 vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it is reviewing a petition that argues the mechanical emergency release can be hidden, unlabeled, and difficult to locate during an emergency, stemming from a 2023 incident involving a Tesla owner in Georgia. The agency emphasized it has not yet decided whether to grant or deny the petition, which applies to an estimated 179,071 Model 3 sedans from the 2022 model year.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe review broadens federal scrutiny of Tesla's door systems following heightened attention on electric door handles that can stop functioning, particularly after crashes or power loss. A recent Bloomberg investigation detailed multiple incidents over the past decade in which occupants or rescuers were unable to open Tesla doors after accidents, including cases involving fires. In September, NHTSA also opened a separate investigation into certain Model Y SUVs after reports that children became trapped when the 12-volt battery failed, keeping Tesla's two top-selling models under active regulatory review.\nBloomberg has reported that potential safety concerns tied to electric door handles were raised internally during the development of the Model 3, with manual emergency releases added to address power-loss scenarios. The latest petition references a case in which the owner said he was unaware of the emergency release location and ultimately escaped by breaking a rear passenger window while the interior was burning. Tesla and NHTSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and the ongoing evaluation could keep questions around vehicle safety design in focus as regulators consider possible next steps.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "From Gates to Musk: Net Worth of Richest American from 1995 to 2025\n\nTravis Woods\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:10 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMSFT\n\nRecently, Tesla CEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk became the first person to gain a net worth over $400 billion, having added $184 billion to his preexisting wealth thanks to a 56% boost in Tesla stock. That extraordinary leap in wealth has also made Musk the wealthiest American citizen (in addition to the richest person on Earth) for the fourth year in a row.\n\nWhile Musk’s total net worth of over $750 billion certainly makes him the richest American, there was a time when a mere $15 billion would have been the highest net worth in the country. Specifically, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ net worth of $15 billion made him wealthiest American back in 1995. That stunning disparity between 1995 and 2025 highlights the massive consolidation of wealth that has occurred at society’s highest levels, in which the 20 richest Americans have collectively amassed $3 trillion.\nBy tracing the arc of the richest Americans over the last 30 years, you can watch as the country’s wealth accumulates and increases around a very small group of individuals — three tech-driven entrepreneurs whose companies have helped reshape American society just as they have collected most of the country’s wealth. Those three men are, per Forbes : Gates, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk. Their accretion of wealth has leapt from $15 billion to a shocking $751.9 billion (as of Dec. 24), and that number is only expected to increase as Musk is on track to becoming America’s — and the world’s — first trillionaire .\n1995: Bill Gates Net worth : $15 billion\nFind Out: If the Top 10 Billionaires’ Wealth Was Distributed Equally in America, How Much Money Would Each Person Get?\nRead Next: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n1996: Bill Gates Net worth : $18.5 billion\nFor You: 6 Money Moves Wealthy People Always Make Before New Year’s\n1997: Bill Gates Net worth : $40 billion\n1998: Bill Gates Net worth : $58 billion\n1999: Bill Gates Net worth : $85 billion\n2000: Bill Gates Net worth : $63 billion\nCheck Out: 5 Key Mindset Shifts To Financially Become the Top 1%, According to Humphrey Yang\n2001: Bill Gates Net worth : $54 billion\n2002: Bill Gates Net worth : $43 billion\n2003: Bill Gates Net worth : $46 billion\n2004: Bill Gates Net worth : $48 billion\nDiscover More: If Mark Zuckerberg’s Wealth Were Evenly Distributed Across America, How Much Money Would Every Person Get?\n2005: Bill Gates Net worth : $51 billion\n2006: Bill Gates Net worth : $56 billion\n2007: Bill Gates Net worth : $59 billion\n2008: Bill Gates Net worth : $57 billion\nBe Aware: What Class Do You Actually Belong To?

      "Content": "Rivian Stock Spiked 67% in 2025. Here's Why 2026 Could Be Even More Profitable for Investors.\n\nRyan Vanzo, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Rivian Automotive should achieve huge scale in 2026.\nIts first model priced under $50,000 is nearing launch.\nFinancial stability should help it close the gap with Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock has performed very well thus far in 2025. Shares are up nearly 70% since the year began, with nearly all of those gains booked over the past month or two. Why is the market suddenly so bullish on Rivian stock?\n\nThere are two reasons: artificial intelligence ( AI) and new, cheaper models. We'll discuss both of these catalysts in a moment. But the important takeaway here is that Rivian as a business is reaching a critical inflection point. Next year could be transformational for the company, with Rivian achieving what few electric vehicle ( EV) stocks have achieved in the history of EVs.\nThis is why electric car stocks fail Over the past decade, more than 30 EV companies have gone under. The reason for these failures is obvious if you look under the hood. Starting an EV manufacturing business takes more than just a good idea -- it takes billions of dollars.\nHuge amounts of infrastructure need to be designed and built to manufacture the cars themselves. And given massive increases in car technology, car makers must also either develop their own proprietary software stacks or pay third parties to license their technologies.\n\nFrom idea to actual production, the process of getting an EV business up and running can easily take more than a decade, plus huge amounts of capital. Investors must be comfortable with putting more and more cash into a money-losing business for years at a time. Given these struggles, it's no wonder that the vast majority of EV businesses never take off. They all, at one point or another, simply run out of capital.\nThis is what makes Tesla so formidable right now. Few, if any, automakers in the world can raise fresh cash as easily as Tesla. The company can raise $30 billion in new capital, for instance -- more than Rivian's entire market cap -- by diluting shareholders by just 2%. Even if Tesla makes several major stumbles, it is extremely unlikely that it will go out of business. This is something almost no other EV company can claim.\nTo match Tesla's success, other EV stocks must reach the inflection point at which raising capital is no longer a desperate concern. This inflection point could arrive for Rivian as early as next year thanks to two catalysts.\nRivian has 2 major catalysts in 2026 Right now, Rivian is still very dependent on investors to remain solvent. The company has forged a multibillion-dollar agreement with Volkswagen , assuaging some of the capital concerns. But the company continues to lose money every quarter, only recently achieving positive gross margins.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat can Rivian do to finally shed the shackles of needing capital markets to survive? The biggest achievement, of course, would be generating a net profit. To do that, the company needs to achieve much greater scale than it has achieved thus far with just two models: the R1T and R1S. Both of those vehicles can easily cost more than $100,000 based on options, relegating them to a tiny fraction of the overall car-buying market.\n\nIn early 2026, however, Rivian expects to begin production of the R2 -- its first model priced under $50,000. Two other affordable models are expected to follow, making Rivian vehicles accessible for the first time to tens of millions of new buyers. In addition, the design of the R2 has created new manufacturing efficiencies that will lower costs for Rivian's existing vehicles, further improving margins.\nWhile positive net profit margins may not be realized in the 2026 fiscal year, these new models should help Rivian achieve significantly better scale in the years to come, giving the company its best chance yet at becoming financially sustainable on its own. Over the short term, the market has finally realized Rivian's potential as an AI stock, bidding up its share price by more than 70% over the past month and a half.\n\nThis will make it easier for the company to raise money for next year's catalysts to be realized. Right now, few EV stocks are financially sustainable without tapping external capital markets. Next year, Rivian could be added to that list, giving the stock a newfound premium versus smaller, lesser financed competitors.\nShould you buy stock in Rivian Automotive right now?

      "Content": "Is Bitcoin a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2026?\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 12:47 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nMSTR\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Bitcoin's four-year halving cycle no longer drives prices the way it used to, because institutional buyers and ETFs have changed the game.\nStrategy, Tesla, and 10 other companies have each converted at least $1 billion into Bitcoin on their balance sheets.\nA 5% to 10% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin may be reasonable for long-term investors who can stomach the volatility.\n10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›\n\nIf technical analysis were an exact science, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) would be soaring right now. However, the charts forgot to check the news. More importantly, they forgot that the structure of the whole crypto market fundamentally changed in 2024 and 2025.\nThe four-year cycle isn't broken. It's either retired or on vacation. VanEck and 21Shares analysts recently published fresh overviews of the broader crypto market and the specific Bitcoin situation.\nBoth firms are basically saying the same thing: The four-year Bitcoin halving cycle still matters symbolically, but it's no longer the engine that drives crypto prices higher over time.\n\nA few themes stood out in their reports:\nBitcoin's annual issuance is now below 1% -- less than gold's inflation rate. That's a nice, symbolic milestone, but also a sign that the upcoming halvings will carry less power. Each halving cuts the mining rewards by less, because there's less left to cut. That's just mathematics.\nThe buyers have changed. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate treasuries, and sovereign governments absorbed more than the total number of mined Bitcoins in 2025. This is patient, sticky capital setting up shop -- not retail FOMO-chasers looking at charting indicators.\nBitcoin's volatility is compressing. The recent drawdowns stopped at 30%, compared to 60% wipeouts (and more) in the first three cycles. Bitcoin is launching fewer moonshots, but fewer face-melting crashes too. In other words, it's starting to behave like a mature financial asset, earning its \"digital gold\" moniker.\n\nBitcoin's bull case Crypto isn't just for enthusiasts anymore. Deep-pocketed investors are building large Bitcoin positions, led by Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) and its 671,268 coins. At today's prices, that's a $58.9 billion Bitcoin portfolio.\nEleven other companies have converted at least $1 billion of cash into Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. The list includes Bitcoin miners like MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms , but also Elon Musk's Tesla and the Trump Media & Technology Group .\n\nStory Continues\nTraditional banks and financial services are still nowhere to be found among the 100 largest Bitcoin holders, but 2026 could change that. With easy access to spot Bitcoin ETFs, cash managers can add Bitcoin exposure to their balance sheets through ordinary stock-trading channels.\nAccording to 21Shares, about 7% of the Bitcoins in circulation already sit in ETF portfolios. That ratio should increase in the coming years, as massive investment services like Morgan Stanley are allowed to recommend Bitcoin funds.\n\nAnd let's not forget about Bitcoin's potential as a hedge against macroeconomic jitters. As of Dec. 23, gold prices are up by 71% year to date, far outpacing a 16% gain for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index. Investors are starving for safe havens. If Bitcoin can connect to just a small slice of that gigantic market, it would chip away at the glittery metal's $31 trillion of total market value.\nThe charts from earlier halving periods couldn't predict any of this, because the market dynamics have changed with ETFs and institutional investors at the table. Things really are different this time.\nBitcoin's bear case It's not all moonshots and rainbows, of course.\nThe institutional investor activity also brings some drawbacks. Bitcoin isn't seeing a groundswell of organic network growth in 2025, and the number of people who own the currency isn't rising. The main idea in the Bitcoin white paper was to supply a radically different digital currency to the masses, but the ownership is getting centralized these days.\n\nBitcoin miners essentially convert electric power into digital coins, but artificial intelligence (AI) systems also use a lot of power. Leading Bitcoin miners are picking up AI computing as a lucrative side gig , diverting electricity and other resources from the crypto business.\nAnd that safe-haven plan is still an academic idea with no real proof. Take the global inflation crisis of 2022, for example. The S&P 500 fell as much as 25% as the drama played out. Gold played its expected stabilizer role and stopped at a 20% loss, but Bitcoin dropped 77% lower.\nAmong these three options, gold has been the best asset to hold since November 2021:\nHow to play Bitcoin in 2026 The bulls and the bears brought their A-games to this fight. Both skeptics and Bitcoin maximalists are leaning on some solid arguments right now.\nI see Bitcoin as a great long-term investment. It's OK if the next crypto winter arrives earlier than expected. In the long run, organic demand for this alternative currency should grow while the supply remains almost unchanged. This thesis is taking a break right now, but it should be temporary. As such, I don't mind doubling down on my Bitcoin holdings when prices are down.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin remains a volatile and unpredictable asset. Unlike Strategy chairman Mike Saylor, I'm not betting the farm, the tractor, and all my chickens on this single idea.\nAbout 5% of my diversified investment portfolio is allocated to Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and crypto-based ETFs. I might increase that ratio to 8% or even 10% next year, but that's about it. You have to account for the risks, threats, and downsides, too.\nShould you buy stock in Bitcoin right now?

      "Content": "Why 2026 Will Be the Year of the Tesla Robotaxi\n\nLee Samaha, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Tesla plans to begin Cybercab production in 2026, but it still needs key regulatory approvals for the vehicles to operate.\nThe case for robotaxis is strong, but Tesla's autonomous vehicles may take longer than expected to get regulatory clearance.\nThe company also plans to begin production of the Tesla Semi and Optimus robot in 2026.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nAt Tesla 's (NASDAQ: TSLA) recent annual general meeting, CEO Elon Musk said the company is gearing up to start production of three new products in 2026: the Tesla Semi, a class 8 semi-trailer truck; the Optimus robot; and its dedicated robotaxi, the Cybercab. So it's set to be an exciting year for the company all around, but by far the most crucial development will be its robotaxi service, which will be built around the Cybercab. That business has the most significant prospects for positively impacting the stock price in the coming year.\nTesla's plans for 2026 Musk has said publicly that he believes that in the future, 80% of the company's value could come from Optimus. He has also asserted that the Tesla Semi could revolutionize the heavy-duty truck market if it achieves on a wider scale the kind of efficiency gains and cost reductions it did in the trial of the vehicle conducted by PepsiCo .\n\nYet as exciting as they are, Optimus and the Tesla Semi are likely to have far less dramatic near-term impacts than Tesla's robotaxi ambitions.\nTesla's robotaxi: risk and reward One of the market's most prominent Tesla bulls, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, says that her firm expects that 88% of Tesla's enterprise value will derive from robotaxis in 2029, compared to just 9% from electric vehicles (EVs). That's unlikely, not least because Ark's median case expectation calls for the robotaxi service to roll out in late 2025, and Tesla has yet to operate its robotaxis commercially without safety drivers as backups. Nor has it started manufacturing Cybercabs -- the vehicles currently being used for the service are Model Y's. Still, it indicates the massive potential for a recurring stream of ride-hailing revenue to drive value for the business.\n\nHowever, to get there, Tesla will need to start mass-producing Cybercabs, and also convince Tesla owners to convert their vehicles into part-time robotaxis using unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software. Tesla plans to begin Cybercab production in April and continue developing its FSD solutions. It also hopes to earn regulatory approvals for supervised FSD in Europe in 2026 – hopefully as early as February. That would help it raise consumer awareness of FSD and support a potential robotaxi deployment in the future.\n\nStory Continues\nThat said, there are two potential flies in the ointment here:\nTesla's vehicles have not been approved for unsupervised FSD yet, so Tesla owners who want to earn money by allowing their vehicles to participate in the robotaxi service aren't able to do so.\nTesla's plan to aggressively ramp up Cybercab production won't make sense if it doesn't receive unsupervised robotaxi approval. Cybercabs don't have steering wheels or pedals. Hence, having a safety driver on board as a backup is not an option.\n\nConsequently, while the potential of the robotaxi service is rising, so is the risk that Tesla will ramp up Cybercab production and capital expenditures without having the necessary regulatory approvals, or at least, enough approvals to justify the ramp.\nWhat management said on the matter Musk was asked about the potential for a mismatch between Cybercab production and regulatory approvals at the recent annual general meeting. He responded that \"the rate at which we receive regulatory approval will roughly match the rate of Cybercab production.\"\nHe went on to say that \"the regulators will have just fewer and fewer reasons to say no,\" based on favorable accident statistics. He also pointed to the deployment of rival Waymo's robotaxis as a development that is helping pave the way for social acceptance of autonomous vehicles.\nMusk is right that Waymo's deployment and Tesla's robotaxi rollout in Austin are increasing the chances of wider approval for autonomous vehicles. However, what's more questionable is the assumption that the early approvals for Tesla's vehicles to operate as unsupervised robotaxis (if there are any) will cover large enough populations and areas to justify the mass production of Cybercabs starting in April.\n\nThe year of the robotaxi As such, investors should be skeptical of the idea that Cybercabs will be a common sight on U.S. streets in the second half of 2026. That said, Tesla is making progress with its robotaxi rollout, and driverless robotaxis are already being tested (without passengers) in Austin.\nMoreover, while critics argue that Tesla has hardly any robotaxi safety data available, because it wasn't until recently that it had any robotaxis in service without safety drivers, the reality is that Tesla has 6.9 billion miles of data from Teslas driven with supervised FSD that indicate those systems achieve substantially better safety performance than human drivers.\n\nAll told, 2026 will be the year of Tesla's robotaxi, but don't be surprised if developments don't unfold linearly throughout the year. Tesla shareholders have good reason to be optimistic about 2026, but they will need to be patient.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Lucid Touches All-Time Lows. Is It Finally Time for Investors to Risk Buying?\n\nDaniel Miller, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LCID\n\nTSLA\n\nRIVN\n\nKey Points Lucid has shed roughly 50% of its value this year, while Rivian and Tesla have posted significant gains.\nLucid sent a message to investors acknowledging a rough period but promising transparency and strong liquidity.\nAfter the third quarter, Lucid made a couple of moves to improve its financial flexibility without much dilution.\n10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›\nLucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID) , Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are all well-known young electric vehicle (EV) makers, and they almost certainly have more in common than not. However, you wouldn't be able to discern that from simply looking at a price chart over the past six months.\nTSLA data by YCharts\nIt's clear that investors are getting a little cautious about jumping on the bandwagon for Lucid stock, even after the automaker has posted seven consecutive quarters of record deliveries and continues to ramp up production of its recently launched Gravity. With Lucid touching all-time lows last week, is it time for investors to take on the risk for its potential upside as the EV maker slowly gains traction in the coming years?\n\nMessage from Lucid It's been far from an ideal scenario for Lucid recently as it faces headwinds in the U.S. market at a critical time for the Gravity to help drive the company into the next phase of growth. Lucid has had to deal with tariffs on automotive vehicle and part imports, changing policies and regulations, and the removal of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, among other factors. But with the stock touching all-time lows, the company had a message for its investors.\n\n\"We know it's been a challenging period for our long-term holders,\" said Lucid's head of communications, Nick Twork, according to news site Electrek. He added, \"We are focused on execution and being transparent.\" Twork reaffirmed that Lucid has \"a strong liquidity runway.\"\nLet's touch on the last point from Twork, as Lucid has made a couple of moves to shore up the company's liquidity. The first was raising $975 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2031. It used roughly $750 million of those net proceeds to repurchase roughly the same amount of its convertible senior notes outstanding due 2026, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe move will essentially kick some of the company's obligations down the road, providing more financial flexibility as Lucid enters an important growth phase with Gravity production accelerating and a family of midsize SUVs on the way late next year.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, some investors may have missed this tidbit: The automaker announced after the end of the quarter that the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, and Lucid had reached an agreement to increase an untapped credit line from roughly $750 million to roughly $2 billion. That would have bumped Lucid's total liquidity at quarter's end to about $5.5 billion, giving it funding that should last into 2027.\n\nWhat it all means The major takeaway for investors is that these moves will increase the company's liquidity with only a minor amount of shareholder dilution -- which is a primary concern, considering past capital raises, as you can see in the comparison to Rivian below.\nRIVN Shares Outstanding data by YCharts\nAlthough this is good news for investors, the reality is that Lucid's cash burn problems aren't fading anytime soon. It's also fair for investors to be wary of Saudi Arabia's PIF's roughly 60% control of the company. It's great to have its support, but could turn into a nightmare if the PIF decides to cut its losses and move in a different direction. The selling pressure alone would weigh on the stock, and additional capital would likely be more expensive to raise.\n\nFor most investors, Lucid is simply far too risky to invest in currently, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Lucid's deliveries are still gaining momentum, and it has funding to last through the launch of its midsize platform, and if the young EV maker can execute those launches and the product is in demand with car shoppers, that's when investors can start considering a small position in a theoretically more balanced and stable young automaker.\nShould you buy stock in Lucid Group right now? Before you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lucid Group wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) is one of the best high volume stocks to buy right now . On December 19, Deutsche Bank raised the firm’s price target on Tesla to $500 from $470 with a Buy rating on the shares. This upward adjustment was driven by the firm's latest analysis of Tesla’s Q4 2025 delivery performance.\n\nOn the same day, Truist analyst William Stein raised the firm’s price target on Tesla to $444 from $406 with a Hold rating on the shares. Truist updated its price targets within the semiconductor and AI sectors following the establishment of its 2027 financial estimates. The firm acknowledged significant headwinds, specifically the difficulty of securing both the electrical power required for AI infrastructure and the capital to fund these massive projects. Despite these challenges, Truist remains bullish and asserts that AI infrastructure semiconductor stocks are still undervalued relative to their projected growth. The firm anticipates greater upward pressure on earnings estimates for AI-focused companies and expects the continued surge in AI capital expenditure in 2026.\nEarlier on December 17, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Neutral rating for Tesla with a $400 price target. The firm is monitoring potential regulatory hurdles in California, where state authorities have warned that Tesla faces a 30-day sales suspension if it does not adjust the marketing of its Autopilot system. This order is currently stayed for 90 days to allow the company time to comply. However, Goldman Sachs still anticipates minimal risk to Tesla’s overall sales volume.\n\nTesla Inc.

Here's My No. 5\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 2:05 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Tesla's profit margins and vehicle delivery numbers were down this past year.\nBut Elon Musk's company has some major projects on the horizon.\nThis includes self-driving cars and Optimus robots.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nWhen you're looking at the Magnificent Seven stocks , there's a clear outlier. Most of them are straight tech companies that are deeply involved in creating artificial intelligence infrastructure, hardware, or software that either makes AI work better or provides unique services.\n\nThen there's an automotive company, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , that is the leading manufacturer of EVs and rode a wave of investor enthusiasm to be the biggest automaker in the world by market capitalization. Tesla currently has a market value of $1.6 trillion.\nBut Tesla has had an interesting year as CEO Elon Musk watched auto sales (and profits) drop. He got involved in domestic and global politics, and the company's still feeling the effects of that. Competition is fierce, and it's a challenging time to be an automaker.\nHowever, Tesla is much more than just a car company. It has massive AI aspirations of its own, and that's why Tesla is my fifth-ranked Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026.\nThis is the third in a series of articles ranking the best Magnificent Seven stocks -- the grouping of companies that collectively represent one-third of the weighting of the S&P 500 , and therefore have an oversize impact on the stock market.

But the problem is that it's not selling as many cars now as it did in previous years.\nYes, third-quarter sales set company records for deliveries with 497,099 vehicles.

Tesla faced severe blowback this year after Musk leapt wholeheartedly into politics, pouring millions of dollars into President Donald Trump's successful campaign and appearing with him at several events. Musk spent the first several months of Trump's second term as a close confidant, running the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with a mission to reduce the size of government.\n\nDOGE was short-lived, as was Musk's Washington career, but the damage was done. Musk has publicly lamented that his federal government role hurt his companies, including Tesla. A study by Yale University professors concluded that Musk's political activities in the U.S. cost Tesla more than 1 million vehicle sales.\nWhat's changing for Tesla in 2026 I admit, there's a lot to unpack about Tesla, and this is why the stock has been a disappointment for much of the year. But it's also important to acknowledge that the company is building some serious momentum, leading to a sharp 13% gain in stock price over the last three months.\nBecause Tesla is developing an AI product of its own with its full self-driving (FSD) software that some analysts believe will be a revolutionary change for the industry. Tesla's newly updated software makes its Robotaxi app downloadable on iOS in the U.S. and Canada and is a significant step toward allowing Tesla users to one day to monetize their Teslas by making them available as robotaxis when they aren't in use.\n\nMelius Research has predicted that Tesla is approaching a tipping point in FSD software in which incremental progress will \"suddenly\" give way to mass adoption of autonomous driving. When widespread rollout arrives with Teslas suddenly on the roads as robotaxis, \"it will still shock most people,\" analyst Rob Wertheimer wrote in a research note.\nMusk said that Tesla will be in a position to expand its production when that happens. \"We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars,\" he told analysts. \"You know, we're making a couple million a year. In fact, with the advent of what we see now as a clarity on achieving full self-driving, unsupervised full self-driving, I should say, I feel confident in expanding Tesla's production. That is our intent to expand as quickly as we can our future production.\"\n\nWhy Tesla is No. 5 Tesla is still working on turning full self-driving into autonomous driving, but as Wertheimer writes, it's making rapid progress and already has a fleet of millions of cars at its disposal to flood the market.\nAnd we've not even talked about Tesla's other massive opportunity -- the Tesla Optimus autonomous robot that Musk is attempting to develop for use in homes and factories. Musk, when negotiating a massive shareholder-approved pay raise this year, repeatedly referred to his \"robot army\" as a potential source of tireless unpaid labor that can be trained to do nearly anything. Part of Musk's massive incentive plan at Tesla, which is valued at as much as $1 trillion with stock options, is contingent on his successfully building 1 million Optimus robots.\n\nSo, there's a lot going on with Tesla. As I said, it's not just a vehicle company. I don't expect Tesla to dramatically improve its margins in 2026, but I will be watching closely as the company continues its AI work. I believe 2026 will be a good year for investors to begin accumulating Tesla stock in advance of what could be a seminal moment for Musk and his company.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk weighed in on an AI debate, siding with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis after Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: META ) outgoing AI chief Yann LeCun dismissed the idea of \"general intelligence\" as an illusion.\n\nMusk Weighs In On AGI Debate Musk amplified Hassabis' rebuttal to LeCun in a post on X , writing simply, \"Demis is right,\" throwing his support behind the DeepMind chief in a widening public dispute over whether artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a meaningful concept.\nThe exchange underscores growing divisions among leading AI researchers over how intelligence should be defined — and whether human intelligence itself can be considered \"general.\"\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nHassabis Says Brains Are Fundamentally General Hassabis pushed back strongly against LeCun's statement that there is \"no such thing as general intelligence,\" arguing that LeCun is conflating general intelligence with the idea of universal intelligence.\nIn a detailed post, Hassabis said human brains are among the most complex systems known and are, by design, highly general learning machines.\n\nWhile acknowledging that no real-world system can escape some degree of specialization, he said the architecture of the human brain — much like modern AI foundation models — is capable of learning any computable task in theory, given sufficient time, memory and data.\nHe added that humanity's ability to invent chess, science and modern engineering, despite evolving for survival tasks like hunting and gathering, demonstrates the breadth of human intelligence rather than its limits.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nLeCun Calls Humans Extremely Specialized LeCun also responded to Hassabis' criticism, saying the disagreement is largely semantic.\n\nStory Continues\nHe objected to equating \"general\" with \"human-level,\" arguing that humans are deeply specialized systems optimized for efficiency in narrow domains.\nWhile conceding that the human brain is theoretically Turing complete, LeCun said it is highly inefficient for most computational problems under real-world constraints.\nHe also argued that the brain can represent only a vanishingly small fraction of all possible functions, making true generality impossible in practice.\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also suggested AGI could arrive during President Donald Trump's term in office.\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt echoed that view at an April fireside chat, saying it is reasonable to expect AGI to emerge sometime between 2028 and 2030.\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

It's according to Reuters. Nvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process. This highlights a pain point for Intel amid its struggling manufacturing business. Nvidia, remember, earlier this year invested $5 billion in Intel, but did not commit to using its chip manufacturing services.\n00:36 Speaker A\nUp next, take a look at Tesla as the company faces a new investigation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is launching a probe into the EV Maker's Model 3 compact sedans. This comes amid concerns that emergency door release controls may not be easily accessible or clearly identifiable. The focus of this investigation is on model year 2022 electric vehicles. The US auto safety regulator has also been looking into Tesla's advanced driver assistance system over alleged violations of traffic safety laws.\n01:17 Speaker A\nAnd lastly, let's check a check here on crypto. Bitcoin continues to slip missing out on the broader seasonal optimism. The world's largest cryptocurrency stalling here between 85,000 to 90,000 range. The slump in the digital asset follows a turbulent couple of months as crypto struggles to regain its footing after falling sharply from its record high back in early October.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The move stems from a petition filed by Kevin Clouse, a Tesla owner in Georgia who says he was trapped in his vehicle in 2023 and requested a defect investigation. NHTSA said it hasn’t decided whether to grant or deny the petition.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

In September, NHTSA opened an investigation into whether the doors are defective in certain Model Y SUVs amid reports of children stuck in vehicles when the 12-volt battery dies. The Model 3 and Model Y are by far Tesla’s top-selling vehicles.\n\nThe automaker was a pioneer of electrically powered handles, which can stop functioning without warning, particularly after a crash. A Bloomberg analysis this week found at least 15 deaths in a dozen incidents over the past decade in which occupants or rescuers were unable to open the doors of a Tesla that had crashed and caught fire.\nBloomberg separately reported that potential safety issues with electric handles were raised with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk during the development of the Model 3, and that he insisted on the futuristic design, which would include manual releases to mitigate power-loss problems.\nClouse filed a petition last month over a 2023 incident in which he says he had to kick his way out of his burning Model 3 when the doors wouldn’t open. Bloomberg previously cited details of Clouse’s case.\n\n“I was unaware of the location of the hidden mechanical emergency door release because it is not visibly labeled, not explained upon delivery, and not intuitive in an emergency,” he said in a complaint filed with NHTSA. “I was forced to climb to the back seat and break the rear passenger window with my legs to escape while the interior was burning.”\n\nStory Continues\nTesla shares fell 0.7% as of 11:41 a.m. Wednesday in New York.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Last week, Wood trimmed her exposure to Tesla (TSLA), sparking fresh debate about whether the electric vehicle and AI giant is still a buy at current levels or if it's time to dump the stock.\n\nWhat Exactly Did Cathie Wood Do? According to disclosures, Wood sold 23,110 shares of Tesla through ARK Invest’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), generating roughly $11.2 million. The sale came shortly after Tesla shares pulled back from record highs earlier in the week. Importantly, this was not a wholesale exit. ARK remains a major Tesla shareholder, with Tesla holding 11.9% weightage, and the transaction appears to be a partial profit-taking move rather than a change in Wood’s long-term thesis. Even after the sale, TSLA stock is up 18% year-to-date (YTD), slightly outperforming the broader market.\n\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nApple Just Released a New AI Model.

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nTesla has been unusually volatile in recent weeks. The stock surged to new highs soon after its Q3 earnings as optimism around full self-driving (FSD), robotaxis, AI chips, and humanoid robots intensified. At the same time, concerns about valuation have grown, making investors and analysts skeptical as Tesla’s core business continues to struggle.\n\nTesla continues to frame itself less as a carmaker and more as a real-world AI platform. In the third quarter, CEO Elon Musk emphasized several long-term drivers. Tesla is expanding robotaxi operations and expects broader deployment as regulatory approvals come through. Second, the Optimus humanoid robot remains a high-risk, high-reward bet, but one Tesla believes could redefine its future revenue mix.\nDespite enthusiasm around Tesla’s AI roadmap, investors cannot ignore the challenges facing its core businesses. In the third quarter, revenue rose roughly 12% year-over-year (YoY) to about $28.1 billion, while vehicle deliveries increased 7.4% to just over 497,000 units. Growth is still present, but it is slowing. Adjusted earnings per share fell 31% YoY, and gross margin declined to 18% as continued price cuts weighed heavily on results. Competition is intensifying, particularly from low-cost Chinese EV manufacturers that are rapidly improving technology while undercutting Tesla on price. Nonetheless, Tesla continues to generate substantial free cash flow ($4 billion in Q3) and maintains a large cash balance ($41 billion) to fund aggressive expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nShould You Follow Cathy Wood’s Move? For most investors, this move should be considered portfolio management, not a bearish signal. Wood did not abandon Tesla. Her portfolio simply reduced exposure after a strong rally. The fact that Tesla shares continued to climb even as ARK sold suggests broader market demand remains strong.\nThat said, Tesla’s stock price already reflects a lot of optimism. Trading at 221 times forward earnings, TSLA stock is expensive. Expectations around autonomy, AI, and robotics are high, and any delays or regulatory setbacks could lead to sharp pullbacks. Long-term investors who believe Tesla will successfully monetize autonomy, AI, and robotics might find any pullbacks as buying opportunities.\n\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About TSLA Stock? Wall Street’s stance on Tesla is mixed, with an overall “Hold” rating. Of the 40 analysts covering the stock, 14 rate it a “Strong Buy,” one assigns a “Moderate Buy,” 16 recommend a “Hold,” and nine advise “Strong Sell.” Tesla has already moved above its average analyst price target of $389.76, while the high price target of $600 implies upside of about 25% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Is Tesla Stock a Buy Under $500?\n\nJabran Kundi\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:42 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock is closing in on the $500 mark. The recent rally was sparked by a reported Waymo outage, which left many of the company’s autonomous vehicles stranded on the streets. This brought back attention to Elon Musk’s full self-driving and autonomy. With the stock struggling to break the $500 barrier in the last week’s trading, investors have started wondering whether it is a psychological resistance and therefore worth selling the stock in the short term.\n\nThe arguments for buying or selling the stock are both valid. Tesla’s valuation is so high that it almost doesn’t make any sense. Yet the company is developing technology that could significantly alter the way we pursue work and live our lives. It comes down to whether someone is investing in the short term or for the long run. The $500 level is behaving like a profit-taking level, so the bearish case remains strong. If one can ignore this short-term investor behavior, the same level could very well be a stepping stone to a multi-trillion-dollar valuation.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nBroadcom (AVGO) Stock Options Are Signaling Pensiveness. Here’s Why the Fear Might Be Unwarranted.\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nAbout Tesla Stock Tesla is mainly known for its electric vehicles and an outspoken and controversial CEO in the form of Elon Musk. However, the company does much more, including in AI, robotics, and energy generation and storage. It is headquartered in Austin, Texas.\nTesla’s 19% year-to-date (YTD) returns have barely outperformed the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 17.58% returns this year. Considering how important AI and robotics have become, one can expect the stock to continue gaining as more previously deemed impossible achievements become a reality thanks to its increasing investments in those fields.\nTSLA stock trades at an extreme premium when we consider most of the conventional valuation metrics. After gaining 15% in just a month, this valuation has stretched further. Even when compared to its own five-year history, the stock is overvalued. For instance, its forward P/E of 377.87x is 1.5 times higher than its five-year average forward P/E of 148.54x. The forward EV/EBIT ratio is over 3 times the historic average of 115.69x.\n\nThe stock is clearly overvalued. But how do we price in Elon Musk’s statement that people soon may not even need to work because of humanoid robots? How do we cater to Elon Musk’s plan of making car ownership redundant, because one could just call a robotaxi from an app without having to worry about owning a car? The answer to these questions is not simple and depends heavily on how seriously you take Musk's word.\n\nStory Continues\nAs an investor, one needs to decide what risk they are willing to take on. If buying at an all-time high makes you wonder about the downside if the broader market takes a turn for the worse, it's better to stay away. If you are excited about the company’s prospects and lead in AI and robotics, buying below $500 could turn out to be a bargain, especially when the FOMO crowd gets back into the stock once it crosses that psychological level of $500.\n\nTesla Misses Earnings Estimates Tesla announced its Q3 2025 earnings on Oct. 22 and failed to beat earnings estimates. It reported an EPS of $0.5 vs. an estimated EPS of $0.54. It did beat the consensus estimates on revenue, reporting $28.1 billion during the quarter against estimates of $26.37 billion. This was a 12% year-over-year (YoY) increase in revenue. The company’s automotive segment grew at a modest 6%, though.\n\nThe bottom line shrank significantly compared to the same period last year. While lower EV prices were to blame, a major reason was the operating expenses, which have gone up due to AI pursuits and similar R&D projects.\nOn the earnings call, Elon Musk restated the importance of having a decent-sized fleet on the roads, which could be turned into fully autonomous vehicles based on just a software upgrade. He expects that in less than two years, the company could be producing cars at an annualized rate of 3 million.\nTesla also continues to face challenges bringing its humanoid robot Optimus to the market. Issues related to hand dexterity continue to take more resources, but supply chain problems are also adding to the mess. Regulatory hurdles for full self-driving and robotaxis also remain.\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying About TSLA Stock TSLA has always received mixed opinions when it comes to valuation, with analysts sometimes claiming price targets that seem ridiculous. The stock remains a consensus “Hold,” but out of the 40 analysts who cover it on Wall Street, 14 have a “Strong Buy” rating while nine call it a “Strong Sell.” The stock continues to trade around the halfway mark of the mean target price of $389.76 and the highest target price of $600.\nOn the date of publication, Jabran Kundi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Tesla had a rough year in the European Union. Sales of its electric vehicles slumped sharply in the first 11 months, according to European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) data.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTesla sold about 129,000 cars in the EU from January through November, down from roughly 211,000 during the same period in 2024, a drop of around 39%. Meanwhile, overall EV sales across the region continued to grow, making up about 17% of the market.\nChinese automaker BYD ( BYDDF ) has been gaining ground fast. The company sold more than 110,000 cars in the EU so far this year, compared with just over 32,000 in 2024. Cheaper prices and a wider model range are helping BYD attract European buyers.\nAccording to analysts, the drop in Tesla can be attributed to increasing competition from other, more affordable brands and certain reputational risks associated with high-piled politics in Europe by Elon Musk. November sales were also an abrupt drop, and it is unclear how Tesla will be able to recover itself in the form of new models and pricing action in 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

EV sales surged before the deadline, but not surprisingly, Q4 sales are expected to plunge 46% quarter over quarter, per Cox Automotive.\n\nChargePoint ( CHPT ), the largest US charging network with 70,000 ports nationwide (compared to Tesla's 35,000 ports), also saw a bump in installations before the expiration of the tax credit. The big question is what happens next.\n\"We expect to see a bit of a pullback this quarter since so much inventory was moved before it expired,\" ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nHowever, he doesn't think the lull in EV sales and charger installations will last long.\n\"I think people that drive EVs are never going back to gas vehicles. We see all kinds of data where they want to stick with electric vehicles once they've made the switch,\" he said, noting more EV sales will boost charger demand.\nWilmer, a 30-year vet of the Silicon Valley tech scene who was recently named to the Time100 Climate list , believes the combo of new EV products and cheaper prices will determine how big of a headwind the loss of the tax credit will be.\n\n\"You've seen Ford announce their new [Universal EV Platform].

      "Content": "European Union Rolls Back 2035 ICE Ban as EV Demand Softens\n\nLavina Shahu\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: STLA\n\nRNLSY\n\nRNSDF\n\nF\n\nTSLA\n\nThe European Commission recently presented a proposal to roll back the EU’s effective ban on new internal-combustion engine vehicles from 2035, following pressure from the region’s automotive industry. The move represents the bloc’s most significant retreat from its green agenda in recent years.\n\nThe proposal, which still requires approval from EU member states and the European Parliament, would permit the continued sale of certain non-electric vehicles. Automakers in Germany and Italy had lobbied for looser rules. The Commission appears to have responded to industry calls to allow ongoing sales of plug-in hybrids and range-extender vehicles that use fuel, as European carmakers struggle to compete with Tesla and Chinese EV manufacturers.\n\nUnder the plan, the EU would replace the current requirement that all new cars and vans sold from 2035 be zero-emission with a target to cut CO2 emissions by 90% from 2021 levels. Automakers would be required to offset the remaining emissions through measures such as using lower-carbon EU-produced steel, synthetic e-fuels, or non-food biofuels derived from sources like agricultural waste and used cooking oil.\n\nThe proposal also introduces a three-year compliance window from 2030 to 2032 to achieve a 55% reduction in car CO2 emissions versus 2021 levels, while easing the 2030 emissions-reduction target for vans to 40% from 50%.\n\nPer Transport & Environment, the changes could result in up to 25% fewer battery-electric vehicles being sold in 2035 than under the current rules. The group also argues that credits for advanced biofuels and e-fuels would enable carmakers to sell fewer EVs in exchange for emissions reductions that do not materialize. In addition, it warns that advanced biofuels cannot be scaled sustainably and could increase Europe’s dependence on imports of used cooking oil and animal fats, which are often vulnerable to fraud.\n\nAutomakers to Gain From the Recently Presented Proposal Ford ’s F hybrid strategy adds resilience as EV adoption evolves. While the Model e segment faces near-term losses, Ford is positioning for long-term success with its Universal EV Platform, designed for affordable, digitally advanced vehicles starting around $30,000. The company plans to begin equipment installation for UEV production in Louisville and start LFP battery cell production in Michigan later this year, reinforcing its long-term electrification strategy.\n\nF currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 EPS implies year-over-year growth of 34.9%. The consensus mark for F’s 2026 EPS has moved up 3 cents over the past 30 days. The stock has gained 26.8% over the past six months.\n\nStellantis STLA has pulled back from its earlier goal of achieving 100% battery-electric vehicle sales by 2030 and is pivoting toward a more flexible, multi-energy approach. This strategy incorporates hybrids and plug-in hybrids alongside BEVs to better align with evolving consumer demand. As part of this shift, the company is scaling back or postponing some all-electric model launches and temporarily halting production of certain EVs where demand has proven weaker.\n\nSTLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 3.2% and 151.9%, respectively. The stock has gained 11.8% over the past six months.\n\nRenault RNLSY is scaling down investment in EV-related services that have failed to deliver strong returns. The company is withdrawing from some car-sharing activities and significantly slowing the expansion of its EV charging network across Europe to refocus on more profitable core operations. This includes closing services such as Zity in Milan and Madrid, and sharply trimming previously ambitious charging infrastructure plans.\n\nRNLSY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 sales implies year-over-year growth of 20.5%. The consensus mark for RNLSY’s 2025 EPS has moved up 4 cents over the past 90 days.

It also shows the extent to which the company’s strong stock performance this year is based on founder and CEO Elon Musk insisting that Tesla is not a car company but an artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicle, and robotics company.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Tesla Inc.

Sales in China, the world’s largest EV market by far, also signaled trouble. According to Barron’s, “In November, the electric-vehicle maker sold just over 73,000 cars in China, down almost 1% year over year, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung.”\nTesla’s problem in the European Union is worse than it first seems. Registrations for BYD vehicles were up 235.2% to 16,158. For the year, the figure increased by 240% to 110,715. BYD, the world’s largest EV company, is Tesla’s biggest rival. The Chinese company has charged into countries outside its home market.\nTesla’s stock has shaken off the bad news about car sales. It is up 20% this year to about $485. What is more impressive is that its shares traded at $217 in March. This was primarily due to Musk’s involvement with President Trump’s effort to downsize the U.S. government, which eventually led to a falling out between the two. Tesla is the world’s eighth most valuable company, with a market cap of $1.61 trillion.\n\nTesla has begun testing its self-driving robotaxi in Austin and aims to roll out tests in Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. However, it needs to contend with other operators in the same space, led by Alphabet’s Waymo.

It is also the sales leader in its home market of China, which is the world’s largest EV market.\nOne way BYD is pushing into Europe is by building assembly plants there. It is considering a factory in Spain, which would be its third in the region. It has plants operating in Hungary and Turkey. These factories might be a way to avoid tariffs on Chinese EVs in the region.\nBYD’s position in China bolsters its finances. Its market share is about 25%, but there are dozens of competitors, including Tesla. Because the market has so many manufacturers, some are likely to go out of business.\nBYD has started to export its vehicles to markets outside China and Europe. One of its major targets is South America, and it has a factory in Brazil.\n\nFor now, BYD will sell no vehicles in the United States because of a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs.

      "Content": "CATL Pushes Global Expansion as China EV Growth Slows\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:47 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: CTATF\n\nHNDAF\n\nTSLA\n\nBAMXF\n\nHMC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nCATL's battery manufacturing scale continues to stand out as global EV demand evolves. At its flagship facility in Ningde, the company operates a largely automated production line capable of producing up to 60 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion batteries annually, a volume described as sufficient to power roughly 1 million Model Ys for Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). According to SNE Research, more than one in three electric vehicles produced this year used CATL batteries, including models from BMW, Ford ( NYSE:F ), Honda ( NYSE:HMC ), Mercedes and Tesla, as well as Chinese brands such as Xiaomi ( XIACY ). This scale has translated into financial and market influence, highlighted by CATL's $5.3 billion Hong Kong share sale in May and founder Yuqun Robin Zeng's estimated $58.3 billion net worth on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with HMC.\nIs HMC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAt the same time, CATL is facing signs of maturing demand in its core market. China's EV sector, where over 50% of new passenger cars sold are now fully electric or plug-in hybrids, is expected by BloombergNEF to move toward a surplus of battery manufacturing capacity, a development that could weigh on pricing. In response, CATL is accelerating overseas expansion, particularly in Europe and Southeast Asia, while navigating rising political scrutiny of Chinese battery suppliers. Its first overseas factory in Germany was designed for roughly 14 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity, though production has ramped more slowly than planned amid higher operating costs, staffing challenges, and cultural differences. People familiar with the situation say some automakers have requested a blend of imported and locally produced batteries to manage costs, leaving a large share of CATL batteries used in European-built EVs still sourced from China.\n\nLooking ahead, CATL is positioning new investments as potential growth drivers while accepting near-term complexity. The company is preparing to start production at its Debrecen, Hungary facility, a 7 billion project intended to supply BMW and Mercedes-Benz Group, with management outlining a phased ramp from 30 to 40 gigawatt-hours and a longer-term target exceeding 100 gigawatt-hours. In China, CATL is testing battery-swapping through its Choco-Swap program, which relies on subscription pricing and a planned rollout of 1,000 swap stations, though management has acknowledged technical and financial risks. In the US, policy headwinds remain, including restrictions on government contracts, yet commercial links persist: Ford is licensing CATL technology for stationary energy storage systems produced domestically, and Tesla is building lithium-iron-phosphate production lines in Nevada using CATL technology. General Motors' August decision to source made-in-China CATL batteries for its most affordable US EVs following the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit suggests cost pressures could continue to shape sourcing decisions, even as geopolitical risks remain elevated.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla price target raised to $551 from $482 at Canaccord\n\nTipRanks\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:50 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nCanaccord raised the firm’s price target on Tesla ( TSLA ) to $551 from $482 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The firm reduced its Q4 delivery outlook for Tesla to 427,000 from 470,000, citing a sharper than anticipated deterioration in demand, with weakness broad-based across products and regions. However, even with the Q4 estimate cut, Canaccord sees “constructive developments beneath the surface” for Tesla. The recent share rally shows the market is looking through Q4, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes the end of U.S. electric vehicle subsidies, while a near-term drag on demand, is “forcing a healthier, more durable market to emerge.” Tesla “still stands alone in the U.S. with a truly scaled, integrated EV franchise,” according to Canaccord. Meanwhile, the analyst believes electric vehicle adoption is “rising quickly” in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil. Tesla’s robotaxi rollout is progressing, the firm adds. Canaccord says the company’s underlying positives outweigh the near-term earnings reset.\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge-fund level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Is Tesla Stock a Buy Before 2026?\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:43 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Major progress with full self-driving technology and Optimus robots can completely change the picture.\nThe current P/E ratio underscores just how bullish market participants have become toward this business.\nInvestors who view the company in its current state will stay far away from the stock.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nIn typical fashion, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have exhibited extreme levels of volatility, swerving between lanes of pessimism and optimism. But through its wild ups and downs, the top purveyor of electric vehicles (EVs) has performed well in 2025. Shares are up 22% this year (as of Dec. 22), and they trade near record levels.\nThe automotive disruptor is in the early innings of some huge projects that could reshape its entire financial picture. But there are strong arguments on both the bull and bear sides of the debate here. So, should you buy this EV stock before 2026?\nTesla is working on innovations that could provide a long-term financial boost Autonomous driving technology is the project that investors are most focused on. Tesla has a history of overpromising and under delivering -- not only on the capabilities of its full self-driving (FSD) technology, but also on the timeline of when features will be launched.\nThe business took a step forward in June, when its robotaxi ride-hailing service started in Austin, Texas, even though it was in a very limited and restricted capacity. Tesla's robotaxis are also in the San Francisco Bay Area, and there are plans to enter a handful of new cities in 2026.\n\nElon Musk said on the second-quarter 2023 earnings call that its robotaxi service could have \"quasi-infinite\" demand. Obviously, the total addressable market is huge, as people all over the world need to get from point A to point B.\nTesla believes that as costs come down and safety improves, most people won't need to buy their own cars anymore. And that could bring high-margin revenue from its FSD software on a global level, both from a dedicated company-owned robotaxi fleet and from customers who choose to let their EVs be used in the ride-hailing service.\nThe company is also focused on expanding production of its humanoid robot, known as Optimus. The goal is to boost the annualized output to 1 million of these by the end of next year. Besides handling certain tasks in factory settings, these machines can have consumer applications.\nAgain, Musk isn't shy when it comes to his forecast; he believes that robotics will one day represent 80% of his company's market value.\n\nStory Continues\nThe market is exuberant over this struggling car company The EV company has never traded in line with its automotive peers. The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 329. Detroit automakers Ford Motor Company and General Motors trade at P/E multiples of 12 and 17, respectively. And supercar luxury brand Ferrari can be purchased at a P/E of 38. So Tesla is on another planet.\n\nThe market's excitement shows just how convinced investors are that Musk's company will make good on its promises, namely that its FSD software and its robots can drive unprecedented financial success at some point down the road This could happen, but no one has any idea when.\nAt the current valuation, Tesla isn't a smart buying opportunity before the calendar turns to 2026. Investors would be paying a nosebleed P/E for a struggling business. Automotive revenue gains have disappointed, and profit margins have been dwindling.\nThere are notable headwinds getting in the way. The EV market is more crowded these days, making it harder for Tesla to stand out. In the U.S., the end of the $7,500 tax credit for EVs can also definitely pressure demand, forcing consumers to think if paying up for one is worth it.\n\nThe market for Tesla's vehicles has exhibited slower growth recently than industry experts had hoped for. Perhaps we're past the phase of early adopters rapidly buying EVs, a group that was easy to sell to. The next chapter of growth could be more difficult to come by since it can be challenging to convince certain consumers to make the switch from gas-powered or hybrid vehicles when the experience or the economics aren't as compelling.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Cathie Wood drops $8.9 million on energy stock\n\nMoz Farooque\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:33 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nOKLO\n\nWhenever Cathie Wood trims her long-time favorite stock in Tesla ( TSLA ), it usually grabs headlines.\nHowever, what matters more is where that capital goes next.\nIn ARK’s Dec. 22 trades, Wood scaled back exposure to some of her biggest winners, while leaning harder into smaller, more speculative bets such as Oklo ( OKLO ) .\n\nShe scooped up 107,321 shares , a purchase worth nearly $8.9 million , indicating a fresh conviction following the stock’s recent pullback rather than a short-term trade.\nNuclear energy stock Oklo has become doubly attractive following its recent pullback ( down 38% in the past three months, still up 293% year to date).\nWood is determined not to miss the next leg of the powerful nuclear rally.\nARK’s renewed buying shows she’s a business that fits squarely into her long-running “ disruptive innovation ” playbook.\nIn fact, Bank of America forecasts nuclear to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the atomic energy trend.\nThe bank framed the incredible opportunity as potentially a $10 trillion market , according to Webull , making the case that global reactor capacity may need to triple by 2050 .\n\nHence, it’s less about short-term momentum and more about a conviction that Oklo’s power-packed fission technology will become a meaningful energy solution.\nAdditionally, it aligns with the broader ARK thesis.\nAs AI computing scales, demand for round-the-clock power is rising at an incredible pace, and next-generation nuclear could step up where intermittent renewables are clearly falling short.\nFor a little color, in the U.S., the EPRI estimates that data centers could reach up to 9% of combined electricity generation by 2030, a load that requires 24/7 stability, Reuters reports .\nCathie Wood’s Monday, Dec. 22 trades Cathie Wood made multiple targeted moves across ARK ETFs on Dec. 22.\nARK’s buys Oklo : Bought 107,321 shares for about $8.9 million , signaling renewed conviction after a pullback.\nArcher Aviation : Added 446,848 shares , worth roughly $3.6 million.\nWeRide : Bought 520,697 shares for about $4.6 million.\nPacific Biosciences : Added 798,771 shares , valued at $1.5 million.\nCRISPR Therapeutics : Bought 787,793 shares for roughly $4.4 million.\nIntellia Therapeutics : Added 187,880 shares , worth about $1.7 million.\n\nARK’s sells Tesla : Sold 60,715 shares , valued at about $29.2 million , extending a gradual reduction after a strong rally.\nRocket Lab : Sold 232,425 shares worth roughly $16.4 million , a clear case of profit-taking after a 200%+ year-to-date run.\nShopify : Sold 33,164 shares for about $5.6 million.\nRoku : Sold 40,217 shares , valued at roughly $4.4 million.\n\nStory Continues\nOklo’s big idea comes with big risks Oklo aims to deliver round-the-clock, carbon-free power through its compact, fast nuclear reactors.\nThe aim is to pair small reactors with recycled nuclear fuel , in hopes of providing reliable baseload power where green energy falls short.\nNaturally, the bear case on Oklo appears a lot more compelling at this point.\n\nIt hasn’t developed a reactor yet, as it aims to commercialize a new small fast-reactor design while also building from the ground up a recycled-fuel supply chain .\nRelated: Morgan Stanley drops tech stocks to buy list for 2026\nOn the other hand, the bulls argue that Oklo is remarkably far along for a nuclear startup.\nIt secured a site and fuel for its first 15-megawatt Aurora reactor, targeting a 2027 startup, and has already broken ground at the Idaho National Laboratory .\nWhile revenues may remain modest this decade, the upside is massive, especially with the International Energy Agency predicting SMRs to reach 40-120 GW by 2050, a market Oklo is racing to lead.\nBig backers, big vision One reason Wood may be comfortable leaning into Oklo is that notable individuals have backed it over the years.\nOpenAI’s Sam Altman invested early, recruited Oklo to Y Combinator, and served as chairman for close to a decade, according to CNBC .\nFunding also came from Palantir founder Peter Thiel (via Hydrazine Capital), Dustin Moskovitz , Ron Conway , Tim Draper , and Accel’s Kevin Efrusy.\nCEO Jacob DeWitte links Oklo’s incredible mission to the AI power surge, making the claim that reliable nuclear power becomes a lot more valuable as AI scales.\n\nFlying cars get their moment Before wrapping up, it’s worth noting that Wood isn’t just betting big on nuclear.\nShe has shown a strong appetite for autonomy in her December 22 trades, with ARK adding shares of Archer Aviation , a leading force in the once-laughable “flying car” space.\nMore Wall Street\nAnalyst who nailed 2023 bull run sets S&P 500 target for 2026\nLongtime fund manager sends blunt message on P/E ratios\nNasdaq’s near 24-hour trading plan sparks Wall Street backlash\nAnalysis: Why ‘cheap stocks to buy now’ is the wrong investing idea\n\nArcher’s stock has surged for familiar reasons, driven by visible progress and a growing belief that autonomous technology may actually work.\nIt recently flew its piloted Midnight air taxi in public, NBC Miami reported, showcasing a sleek eVTOL aircraft that can take off vertically and cruise like a plane.\nOn top of that, it inked a massive deal tied to the launch of air taxi services in Osaka, its first major international foothold.\nEqually important for Archer is

      "Content": "Elon Musk's DOGE tally: The federal workforce is down while government spending is up\n\nBen Werschkul · Washington Correspondent\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:28 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — formerly run by Elon Musk — ends 2025 with strikingly divergent results around its two primary goals.\nOn one front, government payroll numbers are down this year by about 9% , from 3.015 million federal workers in January to 2.744 million in November.\nAt the same time, government spending hasn't slowed, despite Musk's promises there. A tool from the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project tracks government money headed out the door in real time and shows outlays as of Dec. 19 have risen from $7.135 to 7.558 trillion.\nThat's a nearly 6% increase.\n\"DOGE had no noticeable effect on the trajectory of spending,\" the Cato Institute offered in its analysis of the agency's 2025 results. \"But it did help engineer the largest peacetime workforce reduction on record.\"\nMusk's tenure at DOGE ended in May. His own year-end assessment of the effort — delivered earlier this month on a podcast with Katie Miller — was that DOGE had been \"a little bit successful\" and had stopped \"entirely wasteful\" spending, but that he wouldn't personally want to do it again.\n\nDOGE is no longer a standalone government entity, though it says its cost-cutting work continues and is still posting updates on social media, even as the \"latest work\" section of its website was last updated in August.\nWhere DOGE's effects have been most directly felt Musk began to sketch out DOGE in 2024 with a promise of \"at least\" $2 trillion in annual savings. That campaign trail pledge was later revised in 2025 down to $1 trillion and then again to $150 billion .\nMusk had said he wanted to wield a \"chainsaw for bureaucracy\" to cut federal staffing during his time in Washington — even literally holding up the tool during an appearance at an event in February.\n\nHe targeted a range of offices for cuts — from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to Social Security offices — in rapid-fire layoffs and other moves that consumed Washington in the early months of Trump's term before Musk's abrupt departure at the end of May.\nThe biggest drop in the federal workforce, exceeding 150,000, came in October as former federal workers accepted a deferred resignation offer that Musk had initiated earlier in the year.\nAll told, federal rolls have fallen by more than 270,000 workers compared to when the year began, with many involuntary cuts in addition to those leaving government service voluntarily (though some of those layoffs were later reversed).\n\nStory Continues\nBut 2025 ends with things moving in the other direction on the spending side.\nThe Hamilton Project tool shows how far Musk fell short of his savings goals. The federal government surpassed 2024 spending levels on Dec. 9, with three weeks to go in the year.\nYet a DOGE effect is clearly in evidence in select parts of the government.\n\nUSAID spent over $30 billion in 2024, but as a standalone agency, it didn't make it to November, when it was slashed and then folded into the State Department.\nThe overall State Department is also on pace to spend almost $10 billion less this year than in 2024.\nThe Department of Education is another wing of the government that Trump has promised to eliminate completely . For the time being, it's on pace to spend over $40 billion less in 2025.\nRegulators have also seen cuts. The Federal Communications Commission is on track to spend about one-third as much this year as it did in 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission are also pacing lower.\nOverall spending increases The savings in those areas have been dwarfed by other increases — from the Department of Commerce to Homeland Security to Defense to Justice — where spending is up in 2025.\nAnd what's known as mandatory spending remains the primary driver of government spending. Social Security payments alone are set to be over $100 billion higher in 2025.\n\nInterest payments on the national debt will also be about $100 billion higher in 2025, with the national debt growing over $2 trillion since Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\"DOGE failed to cut spending because most federal spending was for entitlement programs,\" according to the Cato Institute , which noted that spending there remains on \"policy autopilot.\"\nMusk himself in recent weeks has been focused on the workforce reductions. \"The matrix was reprogrammed,\" he posted recently about the drop.\nThe world's richest man — who has since returned to focusing full-time on his companies, including Tesla ( TSLA ) and SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) — has also returned to the GOP fold after his high-profile falling out with Trump this spring.\nMusk, who floated the possibility in the summer of launching a third party, has instead in recent months resumed making donations to the GOP .\nBen Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Uber vs. Tesla\n\nRobert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:35 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: UBER\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Uber and Tesla have become rivals as they battle to establish robotaxi businesses.\nUber has chosen to rely on partnerships to drive its autonomous vehicle strategy.\nTesla instead is tackling a grand vision that extends beyond self-driving cars.\n10 stocks we like better than Uber Technologies ›\nBoth Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) famously employed technology to transform transportation. Now, in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) , the two are dueling for supremacy in AI-powered autonomous vehicles .\n\nThe anticipated boon delivered by AI-powered vehicles contributed to Uber shares climbing around 30% in 2025 through the week ended Dec. 19. Tesla stock is up about 20% in that time.\nWhich of these stocks may prove to be the superior investment in the age of self-driving cars? Here's a dive into each company to find out.\nUber's path to business growth Uber once attempted to build its own autonomous vehicles but sold that business as it switched to forging partnerships with similar companies around the world. For example, it began offering robotaxi rides in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates through a collaboration with WeRide on Dec. 12, and in Dallas on Dec. 3 through a partnership with Avride.\n\nThe company is switching tactics yet again, as it renews the pursuit of its own autonomous fleet. Management signed a deal with Nvidia to provide the AI brains behind a fleet of up to 100,000 self-driving cars to begin rolling out in 2027.\nHowever, Uber's use of autonomy is still in the early stages. Its core ride-hailing and delivery operations drive business results today, and those results have been outstanding.\nIn the third quarter, Uber's trip volume rose 22% year over year to $3.5 billion. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, \"Uber's growth kicked into high gear in the third quarter, marking one of the largest trip-volume increases in the company's history.\"\nThis volume growth led to third-quarter revenue of $13.5 billion, a strong 20% year-over-year increase. Uber's strategy to drive continued growth includes leaning into autonomous vehicles as well as investing in other areas of its business.\n\nOne of these is local commerce, where the company seeks to expand its grocery and retail delivery programs. Another involves new channels, such as Uber Direct, which provides delivery services to any size business. In December, Uber Direct and Shopify signed a deal to embed Uber's delivery options into Shopify's e-commerce platform.\nTesla's strategy for global prosperity Tesla may have begun as an electric car company, but today its ambitions are far loftier. Its latest goal is what it calls \"sustainable abundance.\" The company defines this as an era of boundless global prosperity for everyone, delivered through technology.\n\nStory Continues\nPart of this vision involves the development of a fleet of robotaxis. Tesla's cars have long supported some measure of self-driving ability, so extending that to a fully autonomous vehicle was a logical next step. The company is using a modified version of its Model Y in its robotaxi pilot program, which kicked off in Austin, Texas, over the summer.\n\nThe goal is to transition to an AI-driven car with no steering wheel called the Cybercab. Production of these vehicles is set to happen in 2026.\nAlong with robotaxis, Tesla plans to build its AI-controlled humanoid robot, called Optimus, that can perform dangerous or monotonous work. The robot, when combined with self-driving cars, can \"create a world where there is no poverty,\" CEO Elon Musk said. In a sign of confidence, he invested about $1 billion in his company's stock in September.\nThat \"sustainable abundance\" goal can be a worthwhile endeavor if it produces tangible outcomes. But it could take years for the company's autonomous vehicle and robotics efforts to generate meaningful revenue.\nFor instance, Tesla's other major business, energy generation and storage, contributed revenue of $3.4 billion in the third quarter. That represents impressive 44% year-over-year growth, yet it took a decade to get to this point.\n\nToday, Tesla's key revenue driver remains its car sales. This part of its business contributed $21.2 billion of its $28.1 billion in the quarter, up 6% year over year.\nDeciding between Uber and Tesla Tesla's track record of technological innovation allowed it to outmaneuver automotive incumbents, but when it comes to choosing between it and Uber, the better stock right now is Uber.\nTesla's vision for sustainable abundance is commendable, but tangible results can take years to achieve, as its energy business demonstrates. Uber, meanwhile, is racing ahead with its robotaxi plans thanks to partnerships with the likes of Nvidia.\nAnother key factor is Uber's attractive share price valuation. This can be seen in each stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which reflects what investors are paying for every dollar of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\nThe chart shows that Uber's earnings multiple was sky-high in 2024 but has since dropped to a reasonable level.

      "Content": "Can Promises Alone Push Tesla to $2T in 2026? Here’s Why Bulls Say Yes\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:27 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nPLTR\n\nUBER\n\nQuick Read Tesla (TSLA) stock surged 120% from spring lows to all-time highs despite net income declining and revenue growing only 11.57% year-over-year in Q3.\nTesla trades at 219 times 2026 expected earnings. Bulls justify the valuation with Robotaxi and Optimus robot potential rather than current financials.\nAnalysts estimate Robotaxi platform accounts for 45% of Tesla’s total valuation and the Optimus robot accounts for 19% through 2040.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nTesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) has been unbelievably bullish in the past few months. It was supposed to be game over for Tesla once Musk had a falling out with Trump, but TSLA stock is up nearly 120% after bottoming out that spring. It is now higher than it has ever been.\nMusk was also \"vindicated\" by a recent ruling where the justices unanimously ruled to reinstate his 2018 Tesla compensation package. It overturned a 2024 decision that voided the $140 billion deal.\nYou'd expect financials to be better than ever, but that's not the case either. Net income kept falling, and revenue increased by only 11.57% year-over-year in Q3. This is a very modest increase for a stock trading at 219 times 2026 expected earnings. You're paying exactly 15 times forward sales, so even top-notch margins would keep this stock at expensive levels.\n\nThis begs the question: Are promises alone driving the stock? Are investors naive enough to buy into the stock in droves without at least some hard figures to reinforce their conviction?\nWhy are investors so bullish? This is the hardest part to figure out, and what better way to find an answer than to ask the bulls themselves?\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla can reach $2 trillion. This is the same analyst who sees Palantir ( NASDAQ:PLTR ) becoming a $1 trillion company, but a large number of investors share his optimism. His rationale is that Tesla is in a \"defining moment\" due to Robotaxi and robotics. He believes AI and autonomous driving \"could be worth nearly $1 trillion\" and generate profits on top of Tesla's core electric vehicle business.\n\nYou don't have to take permabull Ives' justification for the optimism. Bank of America justified its $471 price target due to the Robotaxi and the Optimus robot. Per its own sum-of-the-parts analysis that runs through 2040, the Robotaxi platform alone accounted for 45% of Tesla's total valuation, with the Optimus humanoid robot at 19%.\n\nStory Continues\nTSLA stock has surged past that price target.\nAnother long-term Tesla bull, Cathie Wood, believes 90% of Tesla's enterprise value and earnings will come from the Robotaxi business in 2029. It is important to note, though, that Wood predicted a tenfold increase in TSLA's price all the way back in early 2023, with the bear case at $1,400. Her justification then was full self-driving technology.\n\nAll things considered, the bulls have a very mobile (pun unintended) thesis for why they see parabolic gains. If Robotaxis end up failing, Optimus or something else that may come up is very likely to take its place.\nWhy Tesla can indeed reach $2 trillion Even though the numbers are not there, the bulls are putting the money where their mouth is. TSLA stock has continued climbing, and the bears have been proven dead wrong in the past year. Wood's portfolio has Tesla as its largest holding with a 12.2% weight.\nIn the coming quarters, Musk can start working on the numbers as the \"anti-Tesla\" sentiment has cooled down. Interest rate cuts will also indirectly raise demand for vehicles as they make car loans more affordable.\n\nIf this coincides with a drawn-out AI rally that lasts through 2026, TSLA stock will be able to reach $2 trillion and beyond.\nWhy I still wouldn't buy TSLA stock While it's true that Musk's promises can get an even higher price tag in the coming quarters, chasing it is not worth it today. Tesla is highly vulnerable to a slowdown of the AI rally. Optimus' presumed long-term potential relies mostly on AI's progress on the software side. The robot's chassis has been remotely controlled by a human in events. If Tesla figures out a way to make it truly autonomous, the sky is the limit.\n\nThis is unlikely to happen even a decade out, but bulls will keep paying for the prospect as long as AI progress in general remains swift. If not, the dashed hopes will drag TSLA stock down with it.\nThen there are the Robotaxis. The potential is surely there, but so is the competition. The Waymo + Uber ( NYSE:UBER ) fleet is larger and more advanced at the moment. Theoretically, Tesla can still dominate if it could make millions of its FSD-capable cars into a Robotaxi fleet overnight.\nPaying for TSLA stock as if that has already happened is still not a good idea, at least in my opinion.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "XRP ETFs Pull in $1.2B as Bitcoin, Ethereum Funds Cool\n\nPeter O'Neill\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: XRP-USD\n\nETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nTSLA\n\nXRP spot ETFs in the U.S. quietly gathered around $1.2 Bn in assets in just a few weeks, even as crypto prices softened and hype around Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs faded.\nXRP itself has struggled after recent highs, but the steady ETF buying tells a different story. This comes as regulators open the door to more crypto ETFs and institutions seek new ways to gain crypto exposure without trading on exchanges.\n\nWhy Are XRP ETFs Pulling Cash When Bitcoin and Ethereum Slow Down? First, a quick refresher. An ETF (exchange-traded fund) is like a basket that holds an asset, in this case XRP, and trades on a stock exchange. You buy it in a brokerage account the same way you buy Apple or Tesla. That means some investors can get XRP exposure without opening a crypto exchange account or managing their own wallets.\n\nAs noted by TradingNews, U.S. spot XRP ETFs from issuers such as Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Canary Capital collectively surpassed roughly $1.2 billion in assets under management (AUM) by mid-month. Canary’s XRPC alone attracted about $245 million on launch day, beating more than 900 other ETF launches this Year.\nHere’s the twist: XRP ETFs logged 21–30 straight days of net inflows while many Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw money leave. Even while prices cooled, institutions continued to add XRP exposure. That hints at a more deliberate portfolio allocation rather than fast money chasing short-term gains.\nEven with $1.2 billion pouring into XRP ETFs, the price has barely budged. Authorized Participants (APs) hedge by shorting XRP futures on the CME when creating new ETF shares, locking up supply in the ETFs while offsetting it with professional selling in the derivatives market.\n\nIf you want a deeper price-focused angle on this disconnect, check our recent explainer on why rising XRP ETF demand hasn’t pushed XRP price higher yet .\nDISCOVER: 16+ New and Upcoming Binance Listings in 2025\nWhat Makes This “Third Path” Different From Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? Executives behind these products describe XRP as taking a “third path.” Bitcoin’s ETF story resembled a giant pressure release valve: a decade of waiting, massive hype, and a launch right in the middle of a bull run. Ethereum’s spot ETFs then entered a crowded field with less excitement and slower early inflows.\n\nXRP’s ETFs, by contrast, attracted over a billion dollars in what asset managers call a down market. As Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan noted in comments reported by Coinpedia via TradingView, that level of demand in weak conditions would likely be far larger in a strong cycle. That matters because it suggests institutions treat XRP as an allocation decision, not a meme trade.\n\nStory Continues\nJPMorgan estimates XRP ETFs may see $4–8.4 billion in first‑year inflows, according to TradingNews. For everyday investors, that kind of steady institutional interest can support liquidity and make it easier to enter or exit positions through traditional brokers.\nXRP is also showing up in broader crypto products. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund now includes XRP, as noted by Investopedia. Think of these multi‑asset funds like a ready‑made crypto index: you buy one ticker and get exposure to several large coins at once.\n\nFor more on how big institutions are approaching other coins, you can compare this trend with our coverage of large ETH accumulation by institutional players and our look at XRP and Solana futures on CME .\nDISCOVER: 10+ Next Coin to 100X In 2025\nWhat Are the Risks for Regular Investors Watching XRP ETF Hype? This all sounds bullish, but you should stay grounded. ETF inflows do not guarantee a rising price chart. In fact, XRP ETF demand has coexisted with sharp XRP price swings and long consolidations. The asset still trades in a market that can move 10–20% in a short window.\nAlso, remember what an ETF actually gives you. You get price exposure, but not direct control of your XRP on-chain. You cannot use ETF shares for payments, DeFi, or staking. If your goal is to experiment with XRP’s tech or on‑chain tools, an ETF behaves more like a stock than like crypto in your own wallet.\n\nInstitutional flows can reverse without warning. If a few large funds rebalance away from XRP, short‑term price and liquidity can suffer. And while the SEC has simplified standards for listing crypto ETFs, regulators can still tighten rules again if they see problems.\nSo how do you use this information? Treat XRP ETFs as a signal of growing institutional comfort with XRP, not as a promise of easy gains. Never buy XRP (or an XRP ETF) with rent money, and avoid FOMOing into a green candle just because inflow numbers look impressive. If you stay patient, size your positions small, and learn the basics of how future XRP ETF waves might play out, this “third path” narrative can become one more tool in your decision-making—not a shortcut.\nAs more crypto ETFs launch and evolve, watch how consistently the cash sticks to XRP during both rallies and pullbacks; that behavior will tell you far more about long‑term staying power than any one headline number\nDISCOVER: 9+ Best High-Risk, High-Reward Crypto to Buy in 2025\nJoin The 99Bitcoins News Discord Here For The Latest Market Updates\nRead original story XRP ETFs Pull in $1.2B as Bitcoin, Ethereum Funds Cool by Peter O'Neill at 99bitcoins.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

BYD's stake went up to 2% from 0.6% last year. This shows that the company is becoming more popular in both the electric and hybrid markets.Analysts claim that Tesla's decline in Europe is due to more competition, a lack of hybrid options, and recent political scandals surrounding CEO Elon Musk that have hurt the brand's reputation. In the meanwhile, BYD's blend of cheap electric and hybrid cars is drawing in those who care about money, even if the economy is shaky.Even if Tesla's overall sales drop has slowed, experts are still wary.

But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

Now, I I'm sure you saw the photos of Waymo getting stuck in San Francisco with the power outage. And my first thought was, I this is everything that could go wrong with a Tesla Robo-taxi.\n00:27 Dan\nLook, my view is 2026 is going to be probably the most important year, I'd say maybe in its history for Musk and Tesla. Because look, the autonomous chapter now comes to Tesla.\n00:46 Dan\n30 cities where we see robo-taxis, you know, ultimately in the United States. Are there going to be issues? Are there going to be speed bumps? Could there be delays here and there? Yeah, I mean, obviously you saw the blackout in terms of Waymo and San Francisco. But look, I think next three to four years, 20% of vehicles are going to be autonomous. And I think that ultimately is where it's heading. And that's why I think when it comes to physical AI plays, the best physical AI plays in the world are Nvidia and Tesla.\n01:31 Speaker A\nHow much value, Dan, are you assigning to Tesla's robotics initiatives?\n01:41 Dan\nA trillion is what conservatively we view. I mean look, if you, S, if you own Tesla here, you're not owning it for what deliveries look like on Jan 2nd, right? I mean, you're owning it for autonomous Robo-taxis. and we talk about bull case 3 trillion, base case 2 trillion. Now look, if I showed you a year ago where numbers were going to go for Tesla this year, you would have thought the stocks 200, 250 bucks. The reality is that investors are looking through deliveries and near-term numbers to understand what the autonomous chapter is going to ultimately bring. because I could argue numbers could be up 4 or 5X when you look out over the next four, five, six years. I think that's the way that to to view a name like Tesla.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "$800 for Tesla Stock Could Be Reality in 2026. Here’s Why.\n\nAnushka Mukherji\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nElectric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla (TSLA) is heading toward the end of 2025 on a surprisingly strong footing, despite a year filled with speed bumps. Political noise tied to CEO Elon Musk, a cooling EV market in key regions, and intensifying global competition have all weighed on sentiment at various points. And yet, investor confidence has remained resilient. In fact, TSLA shares are currently trading near record highs as investors continue to look past near-term headwinds and focus squarely on what’s coming next.\n\nThat optimism is being fueled by Tesla’s future product platforms, most notably the Cybercab robotaxi and the Optimus humanoid robot, both expected to roll out over the next couple of years. The vision of fully autonomous transportation and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven robotics has reignited excitement around the stock, helping explain why capital continues to pour in. This forward-looking enthusiasm is also why Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla’s best days may still lie ahead, despite lingering concerns around the core EV business.\nMore News from Barchart Will Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO?

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nAccording to Wedbush, Tesla is expected to successfully roll out robotaxi services in more than 30 cities in 2026 while simultaneously ramping up volume production of Cybercabs, moves that would mark the true beginning of the autonomous era for Musk and his company. The firm pegs Tesla’s base-case valuation at $600 per share, with a bullish bull-case target of $800, implying an eye-catching 64.7% upside from current levels. Given these ambitious expectations, TSLA stock clearly warrants a closer look.\nAbout Tesla Stock Few companies push the boundaries of innovation quite like Tesla. Once viewed primarily as an electric carmaker, the company has rapidly evolved into a full-fledged technology powerhouse, chasing breakthroughs across AI, autonomous driving, robotics, and clean energy. From self-driving robotaxis to factory-ready humanoid robots, Tesla’s ambitions now extend well beyond the road.\n\nWith a market capitalization hovering around $1.6 trillion, Tesla commands a prized position within the elite “Magnificent Seven.” While EV remains Tesla’s core business and primary revenue driver, investors are increasingly valuing the company less as an automaker and more as a long-term AI and robotics play, betting that autonomy and humanoid robots could eventually become mega-products capable of eclipsing Tesla’s entire automotive segment.\n\nStory Continues\nEven after facing several bumps earlier this year, that confidence has translated into strong performance, with TSLA shares up 21% in 2025. And momentum has only intensified in recent months. Tesla stock has surged an eye-catching 51.7% over the past six months, dramatically outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 15.26% gain over the same period. TSLA is now trading just 1.3% below its 52-week high of $495.28, which it reached on Dec. 17, underscoring how aggressively investors have been chasing the stock’s next chapter.\nA Closer Look Inside Tesla’s Q3 Earnings Tesla’s fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings report, released in late October, delivered a mixed but undeniably compelling snapshot of the company’s trajectory. Revenue stole the spotlight, jumping 12% year-over-year (YOY) to $28.1 billion and comfortably topping Wall Street’s $26.6 billion estimate. Notably, this marked Tesla’s first quarter of revenue growth compared with 2024. A last-minute surge in U.S. demand, driven by buyers rushing to lock in the now-expired $7,500 EV tax credit, played a key role in lifting results.\n\nThat late-quarter buying frenzy helped Tesla’s core automotive business regain momentum, with segment revenue rising 6% YOY to $21.2 billion. Still, the clear standout once again was Tesla’s energy division. Energy-storage revenue soared 44% to $3.4 billion, fueled by accelerating adoption of the company’s advanced battery solutions. With repeated quarters of double-digit growth, this segment has firmly established itself as one of Tesla’s most resilient and fastest-growing businesses.\nBeneath those strong top line numbers, however, profitability painted a more cautious picture. Ongoing price cuts aimed at staying competitive in an increasingly crowded global EV market continued to pressure margins. Gross margin slipped to 18%, down from 19.8% a year earlier, while operating margin fell sharply by 501 basis points to 5.8%. Adjusted EPS declined 31% YOY to $0.50, coming in about 10.5% below analyst expectations and underscoring the cost of defending market share.\n\nLooking ahead, Tesla appears firmly focused on execution as it prepares to roll out some of its most ambitious projects. The company is targeting 2026 for “volume production” of several major launches, including the long-awaited Cybercab robotaxi, its heavy-duty Semi truck, and the next-generation Megapack 3 energy-storage platform.\nAt the same time, Tesla is pressing forward with one of its most futuristic bets, the Optimus humanoid robot. With the first manufacturing lines now ramping up, Tesla’s long-discussed evolution from EV maker to AI and robotics powerhouse may finally be shifting from vision to commercial reality.\nWall Street’s Latest Take on Tesla Stock Wall Street remains sharply divided on where Tesla goes next. The stock currently carries a consensus “Hold” rating, reflecting just how polarized analyst views have become. Of the 40 analysts covering TSLA, 14 see a “Strong Buy,” one rates it a “Moderate Buy,” 16 are staying neutral with a “Hold,” and nine have turned outright bearish with a “Strong Sell.”\nEven so, the upside argument isn’t off the table. Tesla is already trading above its average price target of $387.76, but that hasn’t stopped the bulls. Wedbush’s base-case price target of $600 implies the stock could still rally another 22.8% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "TSLA & RIVN Hit Fresh Highs: Which Stock Should You Pick for 2026?\n\nRimmi Singhi\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:19 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nRIVN\n\nTesla TSLA has been one of the market’s most debated stocks over the past decade, delivering massive gains as the global shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) accelerated.\nIn 2025, the stock has been volatile, marked by sharp price swings. After a shaky start to the year, Tesla shares have rebounded, rising about 21% overall as investor enthusiasm returned—driven by excitement around Tesla’s robotaxi plans, AI integration, and long-term robotics ambitions. The stock hit an all-time high yesterday.\n\nRivian RIVN, meanwhile, has delivered a stronger performance in 2025. Shares have risen roughly 63% year to date and hit a new 52-week high yesterday. The company appears to be borrowing from Tesla’s playbook. Earlier this month, Rivian hosted its Autonomy and AI Day, which helped boost investor interest. During the event, Rivian unveiled a new in-house chip, outlined its robotaxi ambitions, and introduced its Autonomy+ driver-assistance package priced at $2,500.\nWith both Tesla and Rivian trading near one-year highs and pitching bold visions centered on AI, autonomy, and next-generation technology, investors face a key question— which stock offers the better risk-reward setup heading into 2026? Let’s take a closer look.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCase for Tesla Tesla’s position in the EV market isn’t as untouchable as it once seemed. After reporting its first-ever annual delivery decline in 2024, sales fell around 13% each in the first and second quarters of 2025. While the third quarter offered Tesla a temporary breather as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit, fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to decline amid the withdrawal of incentives and intense competition from Chinese EV makers. Management has already warned that automotive margins would remain under pressure from price cuts and higher costs.\n\nWhile the company’s core EV business is facing a slowdown, Tesla's revenues from the Energy Generation and Storage business are on a robust growth trajectory on the back of the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products. This segment stands out as Tesla's most lucrative, boasting the highest margins. Over the past three years, energy storage deployments have surged at a CAGR of 180%. Deployments are expected to continue their upward trajectory.\nMeanwhile, CEO Elon Musk is pinning high hopes on Full Self-Driving (FSD) and robotaxis, calling them Tesla’s most valuable future segment. Its robotaxi service, launched in June, is currently operational in Austin and San Francisco, with Phoenix next after the company recently secured the required permits. Tesla has also outlined plans to expand into Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston and Miami.\n\nStory Continues\nNotably, Tesla has started testing driverless robotaxis without safety monitors, a major milestone that investors see as proof of progress toward autonomous mobility. Musk has also announced that Tesla’s in-car systems will integrate Grok, an AI chatbot, boosting confidence in Tesla’s ability to monetize AI. Regarding robotics, Tesla’s humanoid robot project, Optimus, is seen as a long-term growth driver, adding to the narrative that Tesla is more than just an EV company.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA’s 2026 revenues and earnings implies an uptick of 12% and 43%, respectively, from projected 2025 levels.\nTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\nCase for Rivian Like Tesla, Rivian is also bearing the brunt of slowing sales amid unfriendly EV policies under U.S. President Trump. Rivian has forecast 2025 deliveries at 41,500-43,500 units, down from 51,579 units in 2024. The guidance is also narrower than the range of 40,000-46,000 units guided earlier.\nRivian is now betting on its upcoming R2 and R3 models, targeting more budget-conscious consumers. The R2, a midsize SUV, is slated for launch in the first half of 2026 with a starting price around $45,000—significantly lower than the premium R1 lineup. Rivian views the R2 as a key growth driver, citing major cost efficiencies in both materials and manufacturing. Rivian’s deal with Volkswagen is another booster. Volkswagen will invest up to $5.8 billion in Rivian and their joint venture (JV) by 2027. The partnership focuses on developing Rivian’s next-generation electrical architecture and software, starting with the R2 model.\n\nHaving said that, EV competition is rising and software is becoming a bigger differentiator. So, Rivian is pushing more technology in-house to boost performance and reduce long-term costs.Rivian unveiled its in-house RAP1 chip and new autonomy computer at its Autonomy & AI Day.The company also introduced an AI-powered “Rivian Assistant,” a voice interface launching early next year for both first- and second-generation vehicles. Near-term software updates will bring “Universal Hands-Free,” which promises hands-free driving on more than 3.5 million miles of roads across North America.\nRivian’s decision to integrate LiDAR into its future models is also a key step toward advanced automated driving. With LiDAR, custom chips and a new autonomy computer, the company is targeting Level 4 self-driving capabilities over time.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RIVN’s 2026 top and bottom line implies an improvement of 25% and 11%, respectively, from projected 2025 levels.\nRivian Automotive, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Rivian Automotive, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Rivian Automotive, Inc. Quote\nFinal Thoughts Heading into 2026, both Tesla and Rivian are positioning themselves as more than just EV makers, leaning heavily into autonomy, AI and software-led growth. However, the near-term backdrop remains challenging for both as EV demand is slowing, incentives are fading and competition—especially from China—is intensifying.\n\nRivian’s long-term vision is compelling, particularly with the upcoming R2 launch, deeper software integration, and backing from Volkswagen. That said, Rivian is still far from profitability and continues to burn cash as it ramps up R&D, autonomy development and manufacturing preparations. With breakeven still not clearly in sight, the stock carries elevated execution and financial risk.\nTesla, while not without its own challenges, offers a more established platform. Its core EV business is under pressure, but growth in energy storage, progress in robotaxis and expanding AI and robotics ambitions provide multiple potential catalysts. Tesla remains a high-risk, high-reward story, but it also has scale, cash-generation capability, and clearer pathways to monetization.\n\nWith both stocks currently at fresh highs, near-term entry points are less attractive. Still, if investors must choose one for the long term, Tesla stands out as the stronger option—especially for those willing to stomach volatility in exchange for exposure to autonomy and AI-driven upside. And if even part of Musk’s vision comes together, TSLA could remain a winning stock for years to come.\nBoth TSLA and RIVN currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Elon Musk’s Net Worth Up $215 Billion in 2025\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk’s net worth is up by $215 billion this year to $647 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That increase is almost as much as the total net worth of the sixth-richest man in the world. That is, Mark Zuckerberg, who is the founder and CEO of Meta, has a net worth of $234 billion. Another estimate from Forbes puts Musk’s net worth above $700 billion. The measurements from the two sources rarely match exactly.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk’s net worth is up sharply this year to at least $647 billion.\nThere is speculation that his net worth could top $1 trillion.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThere are several reasons for the Musk wealth increase. There is speculation that Musk’s net worth will top $1 trillion when SpaceX, which he founded and of which he is the largest shareholder, goes public next year with an estimated valuation of $800 billion or more. His exact ownership is 43%. However, his voting share is 79%.\nTesla’s stock is up 21% this year. Its market cap is $1.63 trillion. Musk owns over 15% of Tesla, and a new pay package could take that figure much higher. A fight in the courts over a stock award turned out to be in Musk’s favor two days ago. The package was worth $139 billion. (One argument that Musk’s net worth is lower than most estimates is that the eventual stock option values cannot be valued on the day they are given.) Musk also has a pay package worth about $1 trillion, but he has 10 years of hurdles to clear before he makes that.\n\nxAI is a merger of social media company X and xAI, one of the world’s largest artificial intelligence companies. At the time of the transaction, in March, X was valued at $33 billion ($45 billion, less its $12 billion in debt) and xAI at $80 billion. By some estimates, Musk owns about half of xAI, which is in a race with OpenAI and the AI arms of several public companies, including Alphabet.\nThe reason the Bloomberg figure can only be an estimate is that the value of private companies is hard to peg.\nRising From the Ashes Musk’s increase in net worth is something of a phoenix rising from the ashes. Tesla stock dropped from just below $400 a share at the start of 2025 to $220 in April. Musk’s rocky relationship with President Trump and a decline in Tesla sales were blamed for that. However, the shares have recovered to over $485 apiece.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Musk has said Tesla is much closer to having a fully autonomous vehicle. If these cars go on sale to the general public, Musk’s net worth is likely to soar again.\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

Elon Musk's company is shifting gears away from its car business and focusing more on AI-forward technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Thus, a lane is opening up for a new EV stock to take the lead. Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has as good a chance as any to do it.\nRivian is steadily gaining traction in brand recognition and is consistently ranked among the best EVs on the market. Rivian is also getting ready to launch its R2 lineup of vehicles in early 2026.\nTesla's price is based on future endeavors There are a few reasons to like Rivian stock more than Tesla right now. First, it's trading at a much more reasonable price. Tesla's extraordinarily high price-to-earnings ratio is well over 300 and the stock is close to its 52-week high price of $495 as of Dec. 19. There's a lot of excitement and hype around Tesla and what it may do with its move into broader AI, which is why the stock trades at a premium. If Tesla solely focused on remaining an EV company, its valuation would almost certainly be lower.\n\nThe Rivian comeback is here Rivian is in the midst of a comeback. The company is down almost 79% from its market debut in 2021, but reported revenue growth of 78% in its latest quarterly release. Rivian is expected to move into the mass market with its next generation of vehicles. The R2 lineup will start in the $45,000 range, in line with most SUV pricing.\n\nRivian's ambitions aren't quite as wide as Tesla's, but it has plans for autonomous driving and AI systems, which were discussed in its December \"Autonomy and AI Day.\" It's still early for Rivian, and there's a lot of upside left to capture if the company can succeed with the launch of its new fleet. Analysts are feeling more confident about Rivian's direction, which is why it may be a better choice than Tesla currently.\nShould you buy stock in Rivian Automotive right now?

The largest U.S. EV-maker slid into Q3 but staged a comeback. Things have been looking better in Q4, but after a tech sell-off that began in late October, shares of TSLA were again sliding lower. Over the past five trading sessions, the stock is up 3.53% after gaining 2.61% the five prior. On the year, Tesla is up 28.86%.\nWhen the company reported Q3 earnings on Oct. 22, 2025, it announced quarterly revenue of $28.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year (YoY). However, earnings of 50 cents per share missed analysts' estimates of 54 cents per share. Concerningly, quarterly net income fell 37% YoY to $1.37 billion.\nAfter several quarters of weakening momentum, Tesla's deliveries are seeing a positive break in trend, according to Canaccord. Further, the firm expects Tesla to announce new electric vehicle models soon, which should help its global sales momentum. The new models will help alleviate any post-Q3 \"cliff\" in the U.S. after EV tax credits go away, Canaccord believes.\n\nOver the past decade, Tesla has suffered incredible losses that have shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the stock's rapid appreciation over the past decade. The company's meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That's certainly a move that's come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it's clear that Musk's visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla's IPO on June 29, 2010.\n24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let's dive into whether Tesla's troubles this year can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher.\n\nKey Drivers of Tesla's Stock Performance 1. Core EV Business: Tesla's most important business line is unsurprisingly the company's auto business. With sales of the company's EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company's future prospects in proportion to how the company's core revenue and earnings driver is performing.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla's value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company's core electric vehicle offering, Tesla's energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen.\n\n3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that's been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump's election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We'll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come.\nWhat Wall Street Thinks Tesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. Analyst price targets span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $19.05 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $600 per share. Thus, there's not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn't as easy as it seems.\n\nIt's worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though. However, given how Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it'll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it's best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one's own DCF analysis on and coming to one's own price target.\nHowever, institutional ownership of Tesla remains light. As of Dec. 8, 2025, just 48.12% of the company's float is held by institutional owners, with 117 of them having entirely liquidated their positions over the past year.\n\nTesla's 2025 Outlook As we move through 2025, analyst opinions on where Tesla could be headed do vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Analysts project a 17.5% revenue increase to $117.2 billion, driven by growing demand and energy sector expansion. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below Bloomberg’s consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla’s earlier estimates.\n\nDespite a 62.5% stock surge in 2024, an $80 billion market value drop raised concerns. Musk remains optimistic, expecting a 20% to 30% delivery increase, though management later emphasized a \"return to growth.\" Additionally, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer, but the company recently saw its share of the EV market slip below 50% in California.\nTesla Stock 2025 Price Target Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $382.87, or 21.66% potential downside from today's price. Of the 32 analysts covering Tesla, the stock currently receives a consensus “Hold” rating, with 11 analysts rating it a \"Buy,\" 12 rating it a \"Hold\" and nine rating it a \"Sell.\"\n\n2 4/7 Wall St. 's 12-month price target for Tesla is also bearish at $352.99, which represents potential downside of 27.77% from the current share price. Those figures are based on the company seeing projected revenue growth climb from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

( NASDAQ:TSLA ) gained 3.53% over the past five trading sessions after gaining 2.61% the five prior. A rally that began in early summer has pushed the stock into the green on the year, but the AI-induced sell-off that began in late October and carried deep into November tempered Tesla's performance this fall. Overall this year, the stock is up 28.86 in 2025%.\nWhen the company reported Q3 earnings on Oct. 22, 2025, it announced quarterly revenue of $28.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year (YoY). However, earnings of 50 cents per share missed analysts' estimates of 54 cents per share. Concerningly, quarterly net income fell 37% YoY to $1.37 billion.\nTesla's stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk's role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk's friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla's outlook remains clouded.\n\nIn any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let's check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it's a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term.\nTesla's Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along For a stock that's fallen significantly, I'd expect the growth narrative to have been severely impacted. Tesla's latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla's most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we'll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully.\n\nStory Continues\nUndoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it's one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas' view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied \"AI ETF\" given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes.\n\nThough Tesla's AI efforts are exciting, it's important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it's to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla's been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories?\nThe most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there's also the rumored \"Model Q\" entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a \"wild card.\"\n\nBull Case for Tesla's Share Price Cybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla's robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk's vision of the robotaxi future could be a reality within Trump's term. Of course, a more realistic timeframe would put such a future more than 10 years out.\n\nHowever, if Tesla can floor it on full self-driving (FSD) efforts, perhaps such a future could be closer to the present. There's a great deal of uncertainty with FSD, given the technical and regulatory unknowns. Either way, I view Musk's friendship with Trump as a boon for a Cybertruck rollout under his administration.\nIf Cybertruck expands its presence and becomes a hit within years rather than decades, TSLA stock could prove a bargain, given all that there is to gain. The big question, though, is how Cybercab will hold its own as Waymo pushes ahead with its impressive offering. Given robotaxis, like generative AI, are unlikely to be a \"winner takes all\" market, I think there's no reason why both robotaxi offerings can't win big from prime-time adoption of self-driving.\n\nAnother big question to consider is whether consumers will be interested in buying up Cybercabs to have them rolling around on the streets as ride-hailers. I think the business could prove quite lucrative for buyers and Tesla's margins over the long haul. After all, it can sell the car and continue to build a ride-hailing network while profiting from use of a ride-hailing app of sorts.\nCathie Wood thinks autonomous ride-hailing could represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. If Tesla can get a nice slice, Wood sees TSLA stock at $2,600 per share by 2029. Personally, I think the bull case (for the year ahead) could see TSLA at around $550 per share — or 33.67% higher than where the stock is trading today. That target is shared by Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, one of my favorite analysts in tech.\n\nOptimus: Optimus was a nice addition to the robotaxis event as it amused attendees. But the big question is how much potential the robot has once it's ready to go on sale to the general public.\nUndoubtedly, Tesla isn't the only one getting into the robotics game. Many Mag Seven members also investing heavily in home robots. While more rivals in home robots could be a threat to Optimus, I view it as more of a confirmation that there is a place in the home for such profound innovations.\nAs for the home robotics market, I do see 2026 as a tad overly optimistic for a launch. However, if robot \"friends\" do arrive by 2030, I think Tesla's growth rate could reaccelerate back to or even above 25% to 30% for some amount of time.\n\nAnalysts' Price Targets: So far this fall and during summer, the EV firm underwent a series of price target revisions from analysts. Stifel raised its price target on Tesla to $483 from $440 keeping its \"Buy\" rating while citing progress in its Robotaxi network. Canaccord raised its price target on Tesla to $490 from $333 keeping its \"Buy\" rating. In September, Mizuho raised its price target on Tesla to $450 from $375 while keeping an \"Outperform\" rating. In July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285 while maintaining a \"Neutral\" rating. Benchmark raised its price target on TSLA to $475 from $350 while maintaining a \"Buy\" rating following the successful launch of Tesla's robotaxi business in Austin. UBS raised its price target on TSLA to $215 from $190 but maintained its \"Sell\" rating.\n\nBear Case for Tesla's Share Price Cybertruck: Undoubtedly, there's still a lot of work to do before Cybertruck makes an impact on the car market. FSD capabilities need to step things up and the vehicle needs to be made in a way that won't break the bank. These are big asks. Some bears have doubts about whether the firm can execute the opportunity. In late March, the company announced that it was recalling nearly every Cybertruck due to a potential crash risk. This was an enormous blow to Musk's ambitions for the EV, which has already been subjected to harsh criticism about its perceived shortcomings among owners.\n\nBad Press: Musk's deteriorated image at the hands of his federal government involvement with DOGE aside, Tesla has continued to bear the brunt of bad news. In late 2024, it was widely reported that the EV maker was the most dangerous vehicle brand, with the number of deaths among all automakers, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. According to the study, Tesla has a fatal accident rate of 5.6 per billion vehicle miles, compared to the overall average of just 2.8. Additionally, ongoing protests against the brand — including vandalism and arson — have occurred around the globe, from Italy and France to numerous states in the U.S.\nOptimus: Even if home robots are on the horizon, good luck asking consumers to spend thousands on a proven technology. Indeed, if Vision Pro taught us anything, it's that being an early adopter is expensive and probably not the best use of funds. Either way, I'd much rather wait and see how the robot ambitions pan out before getting too excited at this stage.\n\nInsider & Institutional Activity: There's an old adage on Wall Street that suggests investors should \"follow the money.\" If that's the current case for Tesla, money is flowing out. Over the past 12 months, institutional sellers have outnumbered institutional buyers 2,177 to 1,605, according to Nasdaq.com, with overall institutional ownership having decreased to 48.12%. In total, 118 institutional investors have entirely liquidated their Tesla positions over the past year.\nIncreased competition: In April 2025, a Jeff Bezos-backed EV company called Slate unveiled affordable EV truck and SUV models, which the company aims to sell at a cost of around $30,000. The company has billed itself as the \"anti-Tesla,\" and is made in the U.S. As Tesla's market share has fallen under 50% in EV-friendly California, the arrival of Slate could continue to erode sales.\n\nBase Case for Tesla's Share Price The base case for Tesla lies somewhere in between the two extremes. Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $382.87, or 21.66% potential downside from today's price. Meanwhile, the high-end target is $600 and the low-end target is $19.05. I'm inclined to view the $300 level as a fair-value level for the stock.\n\nMuch of Tesla's story depends on its big growth drivers. In the meantime, EV sales and the rise of more affordable models (Model Q) could be nearer-term stories to look forward to as one waits for the biggest of drivers to pay off. At the time of writing, TSLA stock goes for 232.95 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and an 15.92 price-to-sales (P/S). That makes the name slightly undervalued, at least in my view.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

Investors will be watching Amazon's plans to sell Zoox's robotaxi service, which is expected to continue testing until 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Lucid Group Stock a Buy Now?\n\nCourtney Carlsen, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LCID\n\nNVDA\n\nUBER\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Lucid stock trades down 98% from its all-time high set in early 2021.\nLucid's top-selling vehicle is the Lucid Air Sedan, and production of a high-volume midsize EV platform is expected to commence in 2026.\nLucid is collaborating with Nvidia to develop Level 4 autonomous vehicles and has secured a $300 million investment from Uber to deploy 20,000 self-driving Lucid Gravity SUVs.\n10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›\n\nThere was much hype when Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) went public a few years ago. Investors viewed the luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker as a potentially bold new challenger to Tesla , poised to ride the wave of EV adoption. The company's ambitious vision, cutting-edge technology, and sleek designs had captured attention.\nHowever, things haven't gone as planned. After an initial surge in 2021 that saw the stock reach impressive heights, momentum has faded, and Lucid's stock is now down 98% from its all-time high. The optimism that once surrounded the company has waned as investors focus on execution, competition, and evolving EV adoption rates.\nAs Lucid Group looks to regain its footing and get back on track, here's what investors should know about it before buying.\nLucid's growing vehicle lineup Lucid Group manufactures luxury EVs, targeting an affluent customer base. The company aims to establish itself as a premium brand in the competitive automotive industry by committing to delivering a high-quality driving experience.\nIts top-selling vehicle is the Lucid Air Sedan, the best-selling EV sedan in the U.S., outpacing the Tesla Model S. The automaker also offers the Lucid Gravity, an electric SUV with seating for up to seven adults and an EPA-estimated driving range of 450 miles.\n\nFurthermore, management confirmed that the high-volume Midsize Platform, which aims to compete with popular models like the Tesla Model 3, remains on track to begin production in late 2026. This is Lucid's mass-market product and is a crucial step in enabling Lucid to scale production and improve gross margins.\nLucid is making moves in the robotaxi space In other news, Lucid announced an initiative to accelerate its path to full autonomy in a collaboration with Nvidia . This partnership positions Lucid to deliver one of the world's first privately owned passenger vehicles with Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AV platform.\n\nAlso, Uber Technologies announced a $300 million investment in Lucid Group. This investment is part of Uber's plan to launch driverless rides in the San Francisco Bay Area late next year, using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro's self-driving technology. This move puts Lucid's vehicles in direct competition with other robotaxi services. Uber plans to put 20,000 or more Lucid's self-driving SUVs on the road over six years.\n\nStory Continues\nHere's what Lucid investors need to watch While this news is positive for Lucid Group, the company continues to burn cash as it scales up. The good news is that revenue is up 45% from last year. The bad news is that it continues to lose significant money. Through Sept. 30, the EV maker has an operating loss of $2.4 billion, up slightly from the prior year. This was against a total revenue of $834 million.\nNot only that, but the current regulatory environment isn't favorable to EV manufacturers, either. The Trump administration is resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards to levels achievable by conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. This action reverses what the Trump administration said was the Biden administration's \"unrealistic fuel economy targets that effectively resulted in an electric vehicle mandate,\" potentially reducing the regulatory push to shift consumers to EVs.\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Lucid Group to Underweight from Equal Weight and sharply cut its price target. This decision was based on a more cautious industry outlook, with the analyst stating that the electric vehicle \"winter\" will remain through 2026.\nMore progress is needed Lucid Group is making progress on its large-scale EV product and autonomous driving capabilities. However, the company continues to burn cash and could face headwinds in the near future. Changing regulations and shifting consumer preferences could lead to an \"EV winter\" according to Morgan Stanley, which would weigh on Lucid over the next year or so.\n\nLucid has earned praise for its vehicles, thanks to their industry-leading range, luxury design, and technology. That said, the company is still losing money, which should make investors hesitant. I'd like to see improvements in its efficiency and bottom line before purchasing the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lucid Group right now?

      "Content": "Could This Be the Next Stock to Join the Likes of Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon in the $1 Trillion Club?\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:09 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Oracle is building hundreds of data centers to meet demand for computing capacity from artificial intelligence developers.\nThe company's order backlog is over $500 billion, but investors are worried that it won't all convert into revenue.\nOracle was a stone's throw away from joining the $1 trillion club just a few months ago.\n10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›\n\nThe U.S. economy has a history of producing the world's most valuable companies. United States Steel became the first $1 billion enterprise on the planet in 1901, and 117 years later, in 2018, iPhone maker Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone.\nEight other U.S. companies have since joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club, including Nvidia , Alphabet , Amazon , and Tesla . It looked as though Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was set to join them back in September as its market capitalization peaked at $940 billion, but following a 41% decline in its stock price since then, the company is now valued at just $550 billion.\nRecent stock price performance aside, artificial intelligence (AI) developers are lining up to rent access to Oracle's data center infrastructure, which is fueling a surge in the company's revenues. Could it be only a matter of time before this tech titan charts a path back toward $1 trillion?\nA leader in AI infrastructure Most AI development happens inside large, centralized data centers fitted with tens of thousands of advanced parallel processors -- many of them graphics processing units ( GPUs ) supplied by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It can cost billions of dollars to build a single data center, and since most businesses don't have that kind of money to dedicate to such endeavors, they rent computing capacity from specialized operators like Oracle instead.\n\nOracle's data center infrastructure is among the best in the industry. It uses proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology that moves data between chips and devices more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, even minor increases in processing speed can result in major cost savings over time.\nOracle's data centers also offer significant scale, enabling developers to tap into clusters of over 131,000 GPUs, which is enough to handle even the most advanced AI workloads.\nMoreover, it's bringing capacity online at a rapid pace. As of the conclusion of its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended Nov. 30), Oracle had 147 data center regions up and running with 64 more in the pipeline. OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech juggernauts using Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue is soaring Oracle generated $16.1 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2026 second quarter, which was a modest 14% increase from the prior-year period. But revenue from its cloud infrastructure segment, specifically, soared by 66% to a record $4.1 billion.\nThe cloud infrastructure unit could be growing its sales even faster, but Oracle simply can't build data centers fast enough to meet demand. That's why the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) rocketed by a whopping 438% year over year to $523 billion during the quarter. RPO is like an order backlog, because it reflects the value of signed contracts with customers for services that haven't been delivered yet.\n\nAround $300 billion of Oracle's RPO is reportedly from one customer, OpenAI, which creates concentration risk. OpenAI is still a fairly young company, and it doesn't have anywhere close to $300 billion in cash on hand. Unless it becomes a raging financial success, this enormous commitment might never convert into revenue for Oracle.\nSkepticism about this deal is part of the reason Oracle stock has plummeted in the past few months. The company has around $108 billion in debt, and it's taking on even more to fund the construction of more data centers. The possibility that one of its top customers might never have the money to rent all of the capacity it has requested is spooking investors.\nWill Oracle join the $1 trillion club? Oracle generated earnings of $5.32 per share over the last four quarters on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, which gives its stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.1. That is a premium to the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so even though Oracle stock has tumbled, it still isn't cheap.\nFrom its market cap of about $550 billion today, Oracle's stock would have to soar by 82% for the company to join the $1 trillion club. If we assume Oracle's P/E ratio remains exactly where it is right now, the company would have to nearly double its earnings per share to justify that type of share price gain. If its P/E ratio declines further, it will have an even steeper mountain to climb.\n\nOracle's AI business is growing at a lightning-fast pace right now, so there's a good chance the company will join the $1 trillion club at some point, but it probably won't be the next member inducted. Several other U.S. companies are much closer to the mark: Walmart has a market cap of $911 billion, and JPMorgan Chase is also in range at $872 billion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now? Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Geopolitics remains a factor, too.\"\n\nStory Continues\nOn currency markets, the yen extended gains after Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama flagged authorities' powers to step in to support the unit, citing speculative moves in markets.\nThe yen suffered heavy selling after Bank of Japan boss Kazuo Ueda held off signalling another rate hike anytime soon following last week's increase.\n\n\"The moves (on Friday) were clearly not in line with fundamentals but rather speculative,\" Katayama told Bloomberg on Monday.\n\"Against such movements, we have made clear that we will take bold action, as stated in the Japan–US finance ministers' joint statement,\" she added.\nOil prices dipped, having jumped more than two percent Monday on concerns about Washington's measures against Caracas.\nThe United States has taken control of two oil tankers and is chasing a third, after President Donald Trump last week ordered a blockade of \"sanctioned\" tankers heading to and leaving Venezuela.\n- Key figures at around 0700 GMT -\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: FLAT at 50,412.87 (close)\nHong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 0.1 percent at 25,764.84\nShanghai - Composite: UP 0.1 percent at 3,919.98 (close)\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 156.08 yen from 156.99 yen on Monday\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1774 from $1.1756\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.3487 from $1.3458\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 87.30 pence from 87.35 pence\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.4 percent at $57.77 per barrel\nBrent North Sea Crude: DOWN 0.4 percent at $61.83 per barrel\nNew York - Dow: UP 0.5 percent at 48,362.68 (close)\nLondon - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.3 percent at 9,865.97 (close)\ndan/lb\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Why 2026 won’t be a Big Tech year - and what replaces it\n\nRebecca Mezistrano\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:37 PM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTranscript:\nCAROLINE WOODS\nLet's look ahead to 2026 with Jay Woods, Chief Market Strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. He joins me here at the desk today. Great to have you here.\nJAY WOODS\nGreat to be here.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nLet's kick things off. What's your best investment idea for the new year?\n\nJAY WOODS\nWow. That's an investment. I shrug when I say this, but I think Tesla, from a tactical point of view, maybe time to get back in. But if you're going to get in this, have a stop loss set. This stock just broke out of a five year base, a one year trend, a five year trend, multiple time frames. As a technician, I look to price action to tell us what's going to lead and going into year end.\nJAY WOODS\nThis is a historical breakout. Then when you put the fundamental story, you got to hold your nose when you buy this one. Because if you're going to focus on car sales, you're going to be disappointed. We are buying this on the hopes and dreams that Elon Musk gets things going with that pay package and the robotics story and the autonomous driving story is really what we buy into.\n\nJAY WOODS\nGoing forward, the car sales that where that ship has sailed long time ago. But the technology, what he's doing and those goals for the future. And then think about it, he just navigated a whole year in the Trump administration and came out okay. So I think this could be the year of Musk and the year of Tesla. If this does drop below 420 a favorite number of Mr. Musk, I would get out and take a little bit of a loss.\nJAY WOODS\nBut I think it's poised to have a great 2026.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nWhat about the rest of the magic seven? Is 2026 going to be the year that tech leaves again, or is it going to be the year of the other 493?\nJAY WOODS\nYeah, I think this is going to be the year of the other 493. And I think 2025 when we look at it, it kind of was that magic seven was more of a lag seven, where you only had two performing stocks in it. Google and Nvidia that actually outperformed the S&P 500 . So to me that those other five still have their time, but meta has broken down.\n\nJAY WOODS\nMicrosoft is a little toffee apple slow and steady. Not a bad stock to own. But is you going to have that explosive growth? No. Google is where I still want to be. I think their story, the whole picture there is just tremendous technically major breakout. Amazon is the disappointing one to me. Is someone that owns the stock and touted it last year.\nJAY WOODS\nI want to see it break and stay above 240. It struggles to do that. I still think it's there for them to actually have a great year. We'll see if they can go. But you know, the magic seven right now. It's probably in a congestion phase where it goes sideways in a neutral trend for a while.\n\nStory Continues\nJAY WOODS\nAnd that explosive growth, the momentum, it seems to be losing that, steam. So we'll look at other places for opportunities.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nAnd where are those other.\nJAY WOODS\nWell, that's the problem. Boring is back. We're going to see the financials, which had a great year this year. Continue to do well. Industrials continue to do well. Nice trajectory strong growth. The growth is there. The economy is doing fine. It's just not those high growth names with the explosive upside that we're going to see. So we're going to have more winners than losers in 2026.\n\nJAY WOODS\nBut when the leadership or stocks that don't have the big enough weighting to carry the major indexes to highs, I prefer the Dow over the S&P 500 because it's price weighted. I still think Goldman's going to have a good year. JP Morgan looks great. And my favorite in the financials would be Citigroup. So financials still where you want to be.\nJAY WOODS\nMaterials starting to pick up a big energy is the X factor. I don't want to say hey go in on energy because it hasn't shown us that it's there yet. With crude breaking now 55, as we take this along the trajectory to go a little lower, I think that will be a big opportunity at some point in 2026 to jump into the energy names Exxon Mobil in particularly.\nJAY WOODS\nBut right now I want to see how, you know, the turmoil with Venezuela, Ukraine, Russia, they resolve themselves before I jump in. But I think oil is something to keep an eye on as well.\n\nCAROLINE WOODS\nSo if it's not mega-cap tech that's leading this market higher next year, do we have to level set our expectations in terms of what we could potentially see in terms of returns? Yeah.\nJAY WOODS\nWell, I think when you look at it historically, second year of a presidential term, we saw it in 2018 was a rough year under Trump, 1.0. We're going again into that election cycle. We have tariff uncertainty still looming. The Supreme Court decision did not. It doesn't appear to be coming up before the end of the year.\nJAY WOODS\nSo that should be something we watch in January that will throw uncertainty. If the tariffs are deemed illegal, then we have to look at what the Trump administration does to try to go around it, and then how companies react to it and what it does to inflation . That CPI number has ticked up. Unemployment has ticked up. So we do have fears when it comes to the dual mandate that the fed is watching, that there are concerns.\n\nJAY WOODS\nAnd then speaking of the fed, we have a new leader coming in in in May for that May meeting. So we have three more meetings with Jerome Powell . Listen, for him to set the tone for his legacy. I think that legacy is to look back at how he did navigate that soft landing , if not no landing.\nJAY WOODS\nWorst case scenario. I think he will be judged well over time. And he's going to set that tone. And then the independence of the fed, he's going to stress that going forward. But when a new fed chief comes in, I don't expect everybody to just okay, now we're cutting rates. No, it's a big committee. And for those that think he's going to get a new fed chief, rates are going to go lower and this is going to help boom, the stock market.\n\nJAY WOODS\nI just don't see that coming.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nSo some red flags as you think about next year, should investors be preparing for a pullback ?\nJAY WOODS\nI think you can just rotate. And rotation is the theme we've seen in the last quarter very heavily. And you want to get a little more defensive. Look at the consumer staples stocks like General Mills Procter Gamble Clorox have been beaten down. Just horrible downturns. But we're starting to see signs of a bottom. First they pay a nice dividend.\nJAY WOODS\nThat dividend has increased because the price has gone down. So it could be a good place to park your money for a little while. And you're not going to get that day to day excitement you get with some of these tech names, but, it's a smart way to play it. And then technology is not going away. Cybersecurity stocks still look great.\n\nJAY WOODS\nBut it's hit or miss. And we have red flags with Oracle. And we're talking about the debt issuance. And how that will play out. There's a lot of smoke around that story. And that gets me a little concern going forward. So I think shape is the way people are going to play it. And that's why you want to look for some of these beaten down names to try to make a turnaround.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nSo boring is back for.\nJAY WOODS\nNext morning's big.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nTime to get defensive.\nJAY WOODS\nYep.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nWhat would you say is your most unpopular opinion for next year?\nJAY WOODS\nWe've seen some topping patterns here. We see it already in Netflix and Costco . Stocks breaking down. I'm concerned that this is going to come into some of those big names, like a Microsoft, dare I say Nvidia, Nvidia has been testing support around this 175 level for quite some time now. I do not think it's going to happen, but I am watching price action very carefully in Nvidia because we've seen pockets where it's consolidated over a long period of time six months, seven months, that would be most of next year.\n\nJAY WOODS\nSo I don't think it's going to be the one stock that we want to be in. But if I owned it, I wouldn't sell it based on any of that. So the concern is just congestion, some consolidation, a few breakdowns here and there. And then, let's see what policy and an election does to this market. I am not by any means saying this bull run is over, but the stampede higher is going to be slowing down, and we'll see minimal gains overall for the indexes with, some good pockets of volatility .\nJAY WOODS\nSo the traders back here will be pretty happy about it, that's for sure.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nIf investors need to remember one rule for next year, what would it be?\nJAY WOODS\nOne rule. Patience. It's always patience. But, next year I think we're going to need it a lot. We were ignoring headlines early, this year, and, that did as well, because when that market sold off on Liberation Day and some of the headlines that followed, you know, 100 deals in 100 days, remember, those headlines didn't ever come to fruition.\n\nJAY WOODS\nJust focus on those trends. Focus on opportunities. And those that did this year were rewarded nicely. And I think if we're patient, we'll be rewarded as well. But those big gains, they may be tough to come by. I hope I'm wrong. There.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nAll right. Jay Woods, always a pleasure.\nJAY WOODS\nThank you. And happy New Year.\nCAROLINE WOODS\nHappy New Year. That's Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Video section.

      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Dec. 22: Tesla Shares Jump After Court Reinstates Elon Musk Pay Deal\n\nEmma Newbery, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:04 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nF\n\nGM\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) , electric vehicles and energy storage maker, closed Monday at $488.73, up 1.56% as shares continued to trade near record territory. Tesla IPO'ed in 2010 and has grown 38,483% since going public. Trading volume reached 86.6 million shares, roughly 1.4% above its three-month average of 85.8 million shares.\n\nMonday’s move followed a Delaware Supreme Court ruling on Elon Musk’s compensation, ending a long legal battle. Investors are also positive about Tesla’s latest autonomous driving and robotaxi initiatives.\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) added 0.64% to finish at 6,878, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) gained 0.52% to close at 23,429. Within the automotive and energy space, industry peers Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) slipped 0.07% and General Motors (NYSE:GM) rose 0.83%, underscoring how legacy automakers are navigating EV demand and profitability differently from Tesla.\n\nWhat this means for investors On Friday, a Delaware Supreme Court overruled a 2018 decision to block Elon Musk's pay package. The court ruled that Musk is entitled to stock-based compensation now valued at about $140 billion.\nIn addition to optimism around leadership continuity, Tesla investor sentiment got a boost last week. The EV maker said it is testing driverless cars is Austin with no humans on board. While concerns remain about softer EV demand, some Wall Street analysts, including Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) have upped their price targets for the stock.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) rose +0.63%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) rose +0.49%.\n\nStock indexes on Monday closed higher on support from tech stocks and strength in some of the Magnificent Seven, with Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) closing up more than +1%. Sentiment towards AI stocks has improved after Micron’s (MU) positive results last week, which also supported chip stocks. Also, precious metals miners showed strength Monday, after gold and silver posted new record highs.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nWill Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO?

Sign Up Now!\n\nSeasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.\nIn a bullish factor, Fed Governor Stephen Miran said Monday, “If we don’t adjust policy down, then I think we do run risks” of a recession. However, he also said he doesn’t foresee a recession.\nThe markets are discounting a 20% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on January 27-28.\nOverseas stock markets were mixed on Monday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.29%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.69% for the fourth consecutive daily gain. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +1.81%.\n\nInterest Rates\nMarch 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) on Monday fell by -4 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +1.6 bp to 4.163%. T-note prices were undercut by supply overhang and a lackluster investor reception for Monday’s auction of $69 billion of 2-year T-notes. The Treasury will sell $70 billion of 5-year T-notes and $28 billion of 2-year floating rate notes on Tuesday, and $44 billion of 7-year T-notes on Wednesday.\nThe Treasury yield curve has recently steepened. Short-end yields are being pushed lower by the FOMC’s announcement after its last meeting that it would begin purchasing up to $40 billion of short-term T-bills a month to boost liquidity in the financial system. Meanwhile, longer-term Treasury yields have seen upward pressure from concerns about inflation and the Fed’s independence.\n\nStory Continues\nEuropean government bond yields traded higher. The 10-year German bund yield on Monday rose to a 9-month high and ended the day slightly higher by +0.2 bp at 2.897%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose by +1.2 bp to 4.536%.\nSwaps are discounting a 0% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.\n\nUS Stock Movers\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks closed mixed. Notable gainers included a rally of more than +1% in Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA).\nChip stocks moved higher on continued support after last Friday’s rallies of +7% in Micron Technology (MU) and +6% in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Micron (MU) was a chip leader again Monday, with a gain of +4.0%. Marvel Technology (MRVL) closed up +0.8% after Citi issued a positive catalyst watch for the stock ahead of January’s CES conference.\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks closed mixed after Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) gave up an early rally and ended the day slightly lower. Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY) still closed up more than +2%, and Coinbase Global (COIN) closed up more than +1%. Mara Holdings (MARA) and Strategy (MSTR) closed mildly lower.\n\nPrecious metals miners saw support with new record highs in silver and gold prices. Newmont (NEM) and Coeur Mining (CDE) closed up more than +3%.\nWarner Bros Discovery (WBD) rose more than +3% after Larry Ellison agreed to provide a $40.4 billion personal guarantee for Paramount Skydance’s (PSKY) bid to buy WBD, putting pressure on Netflix (NFLX) to sweeten its bid.\nRocket Lab (RKLB) rallied nearly +10% after announcing last Friday that it won its largest contract yet to build 18 satellites.\nHoneywell (HON) fell -1.6% after management adjusted its guidance to reflect the reclassification of its spun-off advanced materials business as discontinued operations.\nJanus Henderson (JHG) rallied more than +3% after news that Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management and General Catalyst agreed to buy Janus for about $7.4 billion.\nEarnings Reports(12/23/2025)\nNone.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Stock Bulls Drive S&P 500 to the Brink of Record: Markets Wrap\n\nRita Nazareth\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:38 PM PST 12 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGC=F\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The holiday-shortened week started with gains in stocks amid a broad advance that saw a continuation of the bullish momentum on Wall Street. Oil and gold rallied as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. Almost 400 of its shares rose Monday as the benchmark approached a record. Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led megacaps higher. A gauge of smaller firms climbed 1.2%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nNYC’s Adams Challenges Mamdani Rent Freeze With Board Picks\nDespite bouts of volatility and concerns about the AI trade, tech has led the market to the upside this year, and it will probably be the difference between a positive and negative December, said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n“If a Santa Claus rally does kick in this year, St. Nick’s gift bag will likely need to be full of positive tech sentiment,” he noted.\n\nIt’s been a strong year for stocks and the big question is whether investors will carry that positive mood into 2026.\nPositioning in equities is rising and fund managers are maintaining record low levels of cash. Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two rate cuts priced for next year.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran told Bloomberg Television the central bank risks sparking a recession unless it continues lowering rates next year.\nThe S&P 500 climbed to around 6,880. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 4.16%. The dollar halted a three-day advance.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\n“Everything is shaping up for a festive end to the year,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This week is being driven by technical tailwinds, a bit of stimulus optimism, and self-fulfilling prophecy, all of which are setting up a strong year-end and a solid start to next year.”\nHackett noted that the last two weeks of the year are typically the best on the calendar since 1950.\nThe so-called Santa Claus rally, which includes the last five trading days of December and the first two of January, has been positive roughly 80% of the time, by an average of 1.6% since 1928, he added.\n\nStory Continues\n“When this pattern is heavily discussed, it can become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Hackett said. “An important caveat, however, is the consistent theme of the past five years that historical patterns have provided little direction, with last year delivering a negative return.”\nYet Hackett said that market action is encouraging, including healthy breadth, shifting leadership, and greater discernment by investors around valuations.\n“The trend is our friend, 2026 looks to have a strong start, and a potential Santa Claus rally is back on the table, which would leave us ending the year at new highs,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\n\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists across major firms have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade. With the highest forecast from Oppenheimer & Co. at 8,100 and the lowest from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. at 7,000, the gap in their annual outlook is just 16%.\nSuch lockstep views are generally considered a contrarian signal — when everyone’s leaning the same way, the imbalance often rights itself. They also come at a time when market risks are visible. Still, strategists on average see more gains for stocks in 2026, even after three straight years of double-digit returns.\nThe not insignificant amount of good news already priced in includes: an accommodative Fed that will cut rates at least once, if not twice; S&P 500 earnings to grow by about 14%; and a fiscal bump from the recently passed tax law, noted Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers.\n“It seems like folly to think that these would not benefit stocks,” he said. “One must consider whether simply meeting those expectations will be sufficient. If not, then we could see disappointment even amidst a good investment climate.”\nBofA’s Moynihan Says AI’s Economic Benefit Is ‘Kicking In More’\n“Can the market hold up if AI enthusiasm and a dovish Fed aren’t helping it?” said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. “The answer is yes, but only as long as economic growth stays solid.”\nEssaye noted that there was a data deluge last week, and the net result was that economic data and inflation remain “Goldilocks enough to help support stocks.”\n\nAn S&P 500 valuation metric that adds in consumer sentiment suggests stocks are better positioned for gains next year than a more conventional price-earning multiple measure might indicate, according to veteran investment strategist Jim Paulsen.\nHe says that both price-earnings ratios and consumer confidence are “abnormal,” with today’s S&P 500 price-earnings multiple higher than 94% of the time since 1960, while consumer sentiment is at its first percentile since then.\nThe unusually-high PE multiple might be alarming if it weren’t for the accompanying exceptionally low sentiment, he says, writing that “until the Emotion-Adjusted PE rises to a concerning level, investors may be best served by remaining bullish.”\nUS PREVIEW: Third-Quarter GDP to Prove Resilient Despite Tariffs\n“Economic data will start to hit the wires tomorrow, but for now, traders are taking their cue from the general sense amongst participants that there’s little standing in the way for a Santa Claus rally to manifest,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday’s reading on the economy, Bloomberg Economics estimates the US likely grew more than 3% in the third quarter, supported by robust consumer spending and modest investment gains — defying headwinds from tariff-related uncertainty.\nWhile the upcoming datapoints will provide a relevant contribution to investors’ understanding of the trajectory of the real economy, they don’t necessarily hold the needed weight to recast the outlook for 2026, according to said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.\n“As the final trading days of 2025 arrive, the US rates market remains decidedly range-bound with little on the immediate horizon to suggest that will change before the next payrolls report,” he said. Those figures are due to be released on Jan. 9.\nThe past week featured two influential economic releases for Fed policy: employment and inflation, noted Magdalena Ocampo at Principal Asset Management.\n“Taken together, the latest economic readings are likely to give doves in the Fed the upper hand, though uncertainty remains with one more inflation and employment report due before the Fed’s next meeting in January 2026,” she said.\nFor now, she expects two rate cuts next year, likely in the first half, and, provided unemployment doesn’t spiral, Ocampo says a resilient economy, cooling inflation and easier policy should be supportive for risk assets in the year ahead.\nCorporate Highlights:\nAlphabet Inc. has agreed to buy clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash, plus existing debt, marking one of the largest deals by the tech giant to dramatically expand its data center footprint for AI.\nNvidia Corp. has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s Threads will launch podcast previews, or the ability to upload snippets of shows that play directly in user feeds, as part of a broader effort to encourage podcasters and their fans to spend more time on the social network, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nTarget Corp., Whole Foods Market and Walmart Inc. will be added as defendants in lawsuits against baby formula maker ByHeart for selling a product potentially contaminated with spores that cause infant botulism.\nNetflix Inc. refinanced part of a $59 billion bridge loan with cheaper and longer-term debt, bolstering the financial package underpinning its bid for Warner Bros.

Alphabet's (GOOGL) self-driving unit, Waymo, saw several vehicles stall during San Francisco's power outage, causing traffic disruptions but luckily no injuries. Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed the incident on X, posting video footage and stating that \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"\n\nLooking back, Tesla stock has tended to outperform in December , historically, finishing the month higher in seven of the past 10 years. Additional record highs may be in the cards, as today's peak comes amid low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for TSLA in the past.\nAccording to data from Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been two instances in the past five years when Tesla stock traded within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer’s Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th percentile, or lower, of its annual range -- as is the case with the security’s current SVI of 46%, which sits low in the 6th percentile of its annual range.\nIn both prior cases, Tesla stock was higher a month later after both of these signals, averaging a large 17% return. From its current perch, a move of similar magnitude would put the equity at $577.78.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

If you had to choose one to invest in today, which is the better buy-and-hold option?\n\nTesla wants to make more than cars Despite slowing sales, Tesla has a widespread charging network and the most recognizable electric vehicle brand in the world. Tesla is making a push to transform from a carmaker to a broader innovative company specializing in autonomous driving, artificial intelligence (AI), and software.\nThe upside is less about electric vehicles and more about Tesla becoming a fully integrated tech company. The company's stock has remained relatively flat over the past 12 months, but it is still trading at an absurdly high price-to-earnings ratio of over 300.\nBYD is the world's top EV maker BYD, on the other hand, is now the world's largest electric vehicle seller. It is expanding rapidly on nearly every continent. BYD has an advantage in that it controls its entire battery and semiconductor supply chain. BYD produces EVs at lower prices than competitors, which gives it an affordability edge over more luxurious EV car manufacturers, such as Tesla.\n\nBYD and Tesla are both facing increasing competition. BYD's latest earnings report showed a 32.6% decrease in profit year over year. BYD reduced its sales target for 2025 by 16%, but it still expects to double the amount of EV and hybrid cars it exports. BYD trades at a much more reasonable price than Tesla and is up 5.6% as of Dec. 17.\nWhile both companies are successful in their own right, BYD currently offers more global momentum and lower execution risk than Tesla. Both companies face intense competition, but BYD remains a more compelling buy.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) shareholders priority access to invest in SpaceX.\nIn a post on X, Ackman said the structure would distribute special purpose acquisition rights, or SPARs, to Tesla shareholders, allowing them to invest directly in SpaceX or receive cash for their rights.\n\"This would reward loyal Tesla shareholders with the opportunity to invest in SpaceX, while totally democratizing the IPO process,\" Ackman wrote.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nThe proposal aligns with previous comments from Elon Musk , who said during Tesla's November shareholder meeting that he wanted Tesla supporters to have ownership access to SpaceX .\n\nSPARC Structure Details According to Ackman, the proposed transaction would distribute 0.5 SPARs per Tesla share, resulting in approximately 1.723 billion SPARs outstanding, including 61.1 million already issued.\nEach SPAR would be exercisable for two shares of SpaceX, implying a total of 3.446 billion shares.\nThe structure eliminates underwriting fees, founder stock, and shareholder warrants while maintaining 100% common stock capitalization.\n\nPershing Square would also waive its sponsor warrant rights.\nCapital Raising Flexibility The proposal allows for significant flexibility in capital raising.\nAt an exercise price of $11.03 per SPAR, SpaceX would raise about $42 billion in total capital, consisting of roughly $38 billion from SPAR exercises and an additional $4 billion from Pershing Square. If the exercise price were set at $42, total proceeds would rise significantly to approximately $148.7 billion.\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nThe hedge fund investor noted that the structure allows flexibility between primary and secondary shares.\n\nStory Continues\nAckman proposed completing due diligence and a definitive agreement within 45 days, targeting a mid-February announcement.\nxAI Future Offering If the proposed SPARC merger goes through, Ackman and Elon Musk, both close allies of President Donald Trump , would play key roles in shaping SpaceX's funding and organizational structure.\nIn addition, SPAR holders who exercise their rights would receive Pershing Square SPARC Holdings II SPARs, providing potential future access to a public offering of Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI .\n\nIn early December, rumors circulated that SpaceX was seeking new funding at an $800 billion valuation , which Musk publicly denied.\nSpaceX is reportedly preparing for a potential IPO that could reach up to $1.5 trillion, far surpassing major aerospace rivals—highlighting the scale of the opportunity Ackman's SPARC proposal seeks to tap.\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

      "Content": "Naples attorney celebrates victory in restoration of Elon Musk's pay\n\nLaura Layden, Fort Myers News-Press & Naples Daily News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 11:21 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nA Naples attorney is celebrating the Delaware Supreme Court's ruling that upheld a record pay deal for Elon Musk.\nIt's a big win for the attorney — and an even bigger win for his clients.\nTom Grady represented a group of Tesla shareholders in Florida who wanted to see the $56 million pay package restored for Musk as the CEO of Tesla.\n\nAsked about the meaning of the high court's ruling, he said:\n\"It means — complete and total victory and validation. This case was about my clients’ rights (along with other shareholders) to hire whomever they please as CEO, and pay that CEO what they think is fair, not what some court thinks is fair six years down the road, and for their votes to count. Shareholders, not judges, own this company.\"\nThe case began when a single Tesla shareholder, with nine shares in the electric vehicle giant, challenged the compensation package for Musk in 2018, shortly after it was awarded, seeing it as unfair.\nThe package was approved by a supermajority of shareholders in Tesla – twice. A Delaware Chancery Court judge rejected the vote both times, describing the pay as \"unfathomable\" and questioning Musk's influence over the company's board in negotiating his compensation.\n\nIn a 49-page ruling on Dec. 19, the Delaware Supreme Court deemed the rescission of the entire pay package as an \"improper remedy,\" deeming it as harsh and finding that Musk had fully met all of the aggressive and demanding performance-based operational and financial milestones tied to its award — and that shareholders were \"rewarded for his work.\"\nThe ruling states: \"We hold that the Court of Chancery erred in finding that rescission was both 'reasonable and appropriate' for two reasons — first, the court could not restore all the parties substantially to their status quo ante positions; and second, Musk’s existing equity stake could not serve as substitute consideration to restore the parties to the status quo ante.\"\nIn other words, the rescission could not restore everyone to their positions before the pay was awarded, given Tesla's increase in value. It would not \"restore Musk’s consideration of six years of work as Tesla’s CEO.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court also found that the lower court erred in \"faulting the defendants for not proposing an alternative remedy,\" and that it was the plaintiff’s burden to \"satisfy the prerequisites for any form of relief awarded.\"\nAs a result, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiff, Richard Tornetta, could only receive an \"assessment of nominal damages\" — awarding him $1, \"due to his failure to establish hisentitlement to any other form of relief.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\"The good guys won,\" Grady said. \"Shareholder rights matter, shareholder votes matter, and CEOs matter.\"\nTornetta's attorneys will still collect substantial fees, with the panel of five Supreme Court judges recognizing the hard work and hours the legal team put into the case over seven years and its recovery of something for the client, although it's only a penalty of $1.\nInitially, the plaintiff's attorneys sought more than $7 billion in fees. They were awarded about $346 million by the lower court. The Supreme Court significantly reduced that amount (to what's estimated to be about $55 million in fees, not including interest or other costs).\n\nWhile he didn't present his arguments during the Supreme Court hearing, Grady listened intently to the arguments of others on both sides.\nA longtime securities attorney and former Florida financial regulation commissioner, Grady was one of the lawyers representing ARK Investment Management LLC, David Israel and Kurt Panouses in their appeal of the lower court's decision.\nThe largest shareholder Grady represented was Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, headquartered in St. Petersburg. Known for her aggressive bets on disruptive technologies, her investments in Tesla are worth billions, and she's consistently voted in favor of Musk's pay package — as have his other clients, Grady said.\n\"There was never any question about what was right,\" he said. \"It is right to allow shareholder votes to count. It is right to reward CEOs with extraordinary compensation, especially when based solely — entirely — on pay for performance, if that’s what the owners (shareholders) want. It is right to prevent judges and disgruntled shareholders, long after the fact, from complaining about compensation while those same shareholders benefit from the performance that very compensation brought about — incentives matter.\"\n\nHe pointed out that Tesla was worth $50 billion in 2018 when the disputed pay package was awarded with the approval of more than 70% of shareholders and now the company is worth 30 times that amount.\n\"Yes, 30x,\" he said.\nAlong with individual stockholders, Tesla, its board of directors and Musk himself were involved in the appeal.\n\"It will be a Merry Christmas indeed for my clients, all Tesla shareholders, Elon Musk, and people everywhere who believe shareholders should have the right to choose who runs their company and what compensation is right for them,\" Grady said.\nAfter listening to the arguments from both sides from the back of the room at the Supreme Court hearing in October, Grady told the Daily News he was confident the ruling would be in favor of the appellants, based on the judges' questions and comments.\n\nIn case you missed it: Naples attorney involved in Supreme Court fight to restore Elon Musk's pay package\nHis clients' position was different on the award of attorneys' fees. They thought the plaintiffs' attorneys should have gotten \"zero,\" as they did nothing to help shareholders.\n\"They produced no benefit,\" he said. \"They harmed the company.\"\nLaura Layden is a business and government reporter.

      "Content": "Wall Street’s Year-End Buying Drives Stocks Higher: Markets Wrap\n\nRita Nazareth\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 11:11 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGC=F\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The holiday-shortened week started with gains in stocks amid a broad advance that saw a continuation of the bullish momentum on Wall Street. Oil and gold rallied as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. About 400 of its shares rose Monday as the gauge approached a record. Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led megacaps higher. A gauge of smaller firms climbed nearly 1.5%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two rate cuts priced for next year.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran told Bloomberg Television the central bank risks sparking a recession unless it continues lowering rates next year.\nThe S&P 500 hovered near 6,875. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 4.17%. The dollar halted a three-day advance. Bitcoin rose to around $89,000.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\n“Everything is shaping up for a festive end to the year,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This week is being driven by technical tailwinds, a bit of stimulus optimism, and self-fulfilling prophecy, all of which are setting up a strong year-end and a solid start to next year.”\nHackett noted that the last two weeks of the year are typically the best on the calendar since 1950.\nThe so-called Santa Claus rally, which includes the last five trading days of December and the first two of January, has been positive roughly 80% of the time, by an average of 1.6% since 1928, he added.\n\nStory Continues\n“When this pattern is heavily discussed, it can become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Hackett said. “An important caveat, however, is the consistent theme of the past five years that historical patterns have provided little direction, with last year delivering a negative return.”\nYet Hackett said that market action is encouraging, including healthy breadth, shifting leadership, and greater discernment by investors around valuations.\n“The trend is our friend, 2026 looks to have a strong start, and a potential Santa Claus rally is back on the table, which would leave us ending the year at new highs,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\n\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With the highest forecast from Oppenheimer & Co. at 8,100 and the lowest from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. at 7,000, the gap in their annual outlook is just 16%.\nSuch lockstep views are generally considered a contrarian signal — when everyone’s leaning the same way, the imbalance often rights itself. They also come at a time when market risks are visible. Still, strategists on average see more gains for stocks in 2026, even after three straight years of double-digit returns.\n“Can the market hold up if AI enthusiasm and a dovish Fed aren’t helping it?” said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. “The answer is yes, but only as long as economic growth stays solid.”\nEssaye noted that there was a data deluge last week, and the net result was that economic data and inflation remain “Goldilocks enough to help support stocks.”\n\nAn S&P 500 valuation metric that adds in consumer sentiment suggests stocks are better positioned for gains next year than a more conventional price-earning multiple measure might indicate, according to veteran investment strategist Jim Paulsen.\nHe says that both price-earnings ratios and consumer confidence are “abnormal,” with today’s S&P 500 price-earnings multiple higher than 94% of the time since 1960, while consumer sentiment is at its first percentile since then. The unusually-high PE multiple might be alarming if it weren’t for the accompanying exceptionally low sentiment, he says, writing that “until the Emotion-Adjusted PE rises to a concerning level, investors may be best served by remaining bullish.”\nUS PREVIEW: Third-Quarter GDP to Prove Resilient Despite Tariffs\n“Economic data will start to hit the wires tomorrow, but for now, traders are taking their cue from the general sense amongst participants that there’s little standing in the way for a Santa Claus rally to manifest,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday’s reading on the economy, Bloomberg Economics estimates the US likely grew more than 3% in the third quarter, supported by robust consumer spending and modest investment gains — defying headwinds from tariff-related uncertainty.\n“The incoming economic data is second-tier at best, a fact that further reinforces the notion that rates will stay in an all-too-familiar territory as 2026 quickly approaches,” said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.\nCorporate Highlights:\nAlphabet Inc. has agreed to buy clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash, plus existing debt, marking one of the largest deals by the tech giant to dramatically expand its data center footprint for AI.\nNvidia Corp. has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s Threads will launch podcast previews, or the ability to upload snippets of shows that play directly in user feeds, as part of a broader effort to encourage podcasters and their fans to spend more time on the social network, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nOpenAI has squeezed better margins out of its paid products this year, as it races to maintain its pole position in artificial intelligence, according to a report in The Information.\nTarget Corp., Whole Foods Market and Walmart Inc. will be added as defendants in lawsuits against baby formula maker ByHeart for selling a product potentially contaminated with spores that cause infant botulism.\nNetflix Inc. refinanced part of a $59 billion bridge loan with cheaper and longer-term debt, bolstering the financial package underpinning its bid for Warner Bros.

      "Content": "'Give Me Money,' Says Elon Musk As He's Asked How To Start With $1,000 — Even As He Warns It Would Take 'Armageddon' For Him To Be Broke\n\nCasey B. Renner\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nA blunt response about starting over with $1,000 drew attention after a billionaire said the most realistic move would be to ask people to give him money. Financial collapse would only be possible if civilization itself had already broken down, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk said.\nSpeaking on a recent episode of the \"Katie Miller Podcast,\" he explained why the question does not work under normal conditions.\n\nDon't Miss:\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nWhy Musk Says Only ‘Armageddon' Fits The Scenario Musk said it would take \"Armageddon,\" or what he described as \"Ragnarok next level,\" for him to be reduced to such limited resources. He told host Katie Miller that someone with his level of experience and accumulated knowledge would not realistically end up there otherwise.\n\"At this point, I have a lot of knowledge,\" Musk said. \"It's impossible for me, for someone to have that amount of knowledge, and then be dropped down to a low resource amount.\"\n\nHe said such a situation would only make sense if \"something truly catastrophic has happened, like civilization has melted,\" or if all assets had been lost under extreme circumstances. In that scenario, he added, money itself would lose much of its value.\n\"If civilization has melted,\" Musk said, \"$1,000 is not going to solve your problems.\"\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\n‘Give Me Money' If Society Still Exists Musk told Miller that an alternative assumes civilization is still functioning. Under those conditions, he said, the answer would be straightforward. \"I will be able to ask people to just give me money,\" Musk said, adding that he could do so \"with the promise that I will have a high return.\"\n\nHe illustrated the point with a simple example. \"If you give me a dollar, you will get back much more than a dollar,\" he said.\nMusk described the situation as an \"impossible dichotomy.\" Either society has collapsed, he said, or financial systems are still operating. If those systems exist, he argued, reputation, access to capital and trust matter far more than the size of a starting sum.\nHe also pointed to his own early life, saying he arrived in North America at age 17 with \"about 2,500 bucks Canadian\" [$1,800], along with \"one bag of books and one bag of clothes.\"\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nThe Broader Tech Context The comments came during a broader discussion that also covered artificial intelligence, robotics, and the future of work. Musk said artificial intelligence and robots will eventually be able to provide \"all the goods and services that anyone could possibly want.\"\nAt the same time, he said the pace of that progress worries him. \"I've had a lot of AI nightmares,\" Musk said, while also acknowledging that slowing development may not be realistic.\n\nRead Next: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "Waymo is back online in San Francisco, but may struggle after failure\n\nTony Owusu\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:17 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Waymo, 2025 has been a year of one step forward and two steps back.\nFor now, it has leapt ahead of big money rivals like Tesla Robotaxi and Amazon-backed Zoox.\nWaymo quick facts: Founded in 2009.\nPassed the first U.S. state self-driving test in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2012.\nSource: IEEE Spectrum\nSpun out from Alphabet as a separate subsidiary in 2016.\nAs of July 2025, Google indicates that Waymo One is available 24/7 to customers in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nThe current Waymo fleet features over 1,500 vehicles. By 2026, the company expects to add 2,000 more.\n\nWaymo began operating fully autonomous vehicles in Miami on Nov. 18 and said it will start operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando “over the coming weeks, ahead of opening our doors to riders next year.”\nIt is also “returning” to Las Vegas and regularly testing in Detroit during winter weather , and spreading its fleet of more than 200 vehicles to new locations seemingly every month.\nBut the Alphabet-backed company is also facing issues such as a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probe into the autonomous vehicles for “traffic safety violations relating to stopping when encountering a school bus, particularly when the bus is boarding or offboarding students.”\nBut recently, some of Waymo's biggest issues have arisen in the company's home city of San Francisco.\nSan Francisco power outage temporarily stops Waymo autonomous vehicles Waymo currently operates a fleet of approximately 2,000 vehicles on U.S. roads.\nApproximately 800 of those autonomous vehicles are operating in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to data the company shared with the San Francisco Examiner in August , making the City by the Bay the company's unofficial center of operations.\n\nRelated: Waymo customer swears off autonomous driving after close call\nHowever, the company recently experienced a significant issue in its hometown.\nIn a viral video from No Safe Words on X ( formerly Twitter ), it looked like an endless line of Waymos had taken over one city street on Nov. 22. The company says the vehicles were all headed to a “mass hailing event” in the video, causing the bottleneck that was filmed.\nThis weekend, the company experienced an even more disruptive event after its San Francisco fleet was unable to navigate the terrain during a massive blackout in the city, which has a population of more than 800,000.\nWaymo was forced to suspend service in San Francisco, as apparently its vehicles did not know the \"four-way-stop\" rule that applies to intersections with inoperable traffic lights.\n\nStory Continues\nThe vehicles were filmed stuck at numerous intersections , unsure how to navigate the situation , causing even more turmoil on the roads as drivers slowly inch past electricity-less city blocks.\nA fire caused the outage, which affected 130,000 citizens in the city.\n“The sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion,” Waymo said in a statement as it temporarily shut down operations in the city.\n\nWaymo restores San Francisco service, but can it restore customer faith in the company? While Waymo suspended the service on Saturday, Dec. 20, by 7 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Waymo said it was resuming service in the region.\nAs for the passengers caught in the vehicles during the disruption, Waymo says \"the majority of active trips were completed before vehicles returned to depots or pulled over,\" so at least \"the majority\" of passengers weren't left stranded.\n\nRelated: Waymo pulls ahead of Tesla Robotaxi, Amazon Zoox with latest move\nWaymo says its vehicles represent a 91% reduction in serious injury or worse crashes, a 79% decrease in airbag deployment crashes, and an 80% decrease in injury-causing crashes.\nWaymo is also safer for non-drivers, with 92% fewer pedestrian crashes resulting in injuries, 78% fewer cyclist crashes resulting in injuries, and 89% fewer motorcycle crashes resulting in injuries.\nBut good luck to Waymo convincing San Franciscans, and other Californians, about those numbers after the recent high-profile incidents in the city.\nNearly 80% of California voters support requiring a human safety operator in self-driving trucks and delivery vehicles, and just 33% of voters express a favorable general impression of autonomous vehicles.\n\n“We are increasingly bringing AI from the digital world to the physical world, and it’s critically important that we do that in a very careful and considerate way,” Rowan Stone, CEO of AI data training company Sapien, told TheStreet.\nSapien currently works with Waymo rival Zoox.\n“What we can do better as an entire industry is resist the urge to move quickly and break things, especially when you’re dealing with a hunk of metal that could potentially kill people,” he said.\nWaymo issues extend beyond San Francisco San Francisco isn't the only city where Waymo has had to temporarily pause operations in recent weeks.\nOn Dec. 1, after Waymo received its 20th citation from the Austin Independent School District for the current school year, Austin ISD decided to release the video of the previous infractions to the public.\n\nBy Dec. 5, Waymo announced that it would file for a voluntary recall after videos of the company's robotaxis committing traffic violations while operating in school bus zones went viral.\nThe Austin ISD had been in private contact with the company, but as the incidences of Waymos driving through school bus stop signs piled up (eventually averaging 1.5 per week), the Austin ISD decided to go public.\n“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” said Muaricio Peña, chief security officer for Waymo.\nBack in California, Waymos have been recorded piling up at Santa Monica charging stations at night in Southern California.\n\nA video , posted on X by Nic Cruz Patane, shows a seemingly endless line of lifeless robots waiting to be charged, is eerily similar to the video from San Francisco.\nOn Nov. 24, the city formally demanded Waymo cease overnight operations at its two local autonomous vehicle charging facilities.\nThe move comes after months of noise complaints from nearby residents, according to the Santa Monica Daily Press . The directive was unanimously approved in a 6-0 City Council vote on Nov. 18, but now the city is demanding that property owners, lessees, and operators immediately stop nighttime operations due to nuisance conditions at the two charging sites.\nResidents in the neighborhood have complained about the constant noise and disruption caused by the 24-hour operations, with some deliberately blocking the vehicles’ entry and exit. They have been bothered by everything from the legally mandated backup alarms to other vehicle noises that have become incessant.\n\nIn a statement, Waymo said it has been listening to community input and is “committed to continuing to operate and invest” in Santa Monica. It says it has adjusted operations at the site in response to community feedback and that it will continue to seek community input.\nRelated: Waymo pumps the brakes as dangerous issue comes to light\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

Waymo claimed it stopped operations as a safety measure because its vehicles were in situations that were quite different from what they were accustomed to.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with LSF.\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nSuzanne Philion, a spokesperson for the company, told CNBC that \"yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco,\" with traffic signals not working and transit delays. She also said that the company is focused on making sure its technology can adapt safely when city infrastructure fails.\nThe disturbance also brought up old similarities. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ), said on X that \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by SF power.\"\nHowever, Tesla does not have a completely autonomous robotaxi service in San Francisco. It needs a person behind the wheel for its local trips, unlike Waymo's self-driving cars, which don't need a person behind the wheel.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Oil and gold rallied as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. Over 400 of its shares rose as the gauge approached a record. Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led megacaps higher.

Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two rate cuts priced for next year.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran told Bloomberg Television the central bank risks sparking a recession unless it continues lowering rates next year.\nThe S&P 500 hovered near 6,875. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 4.17%. The dollar halted a three-day advance. Bitcoin climbed to around $90,000.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With the highest forecast from Oppenheimer & Co. at 8,100 and the lowest from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. at 7,000, the gap in their annual outlook is just 16%.\nSuch lockstep views are generally considered a contrarian signal — when everyone’s leaning the same way, the imbalance often rights itself. They also come at a time when market risks are visible. Still, strategists on average see more gains for stocks in 2026, even after three straight years of double-digit returns.\nUS PREVIEW: Third-Quarter GDP to Prove Resilient Despite Tariffs\n“Can the market hold up if AI enthusiasm and a dovish Fed aren’t helping it?” said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. “The answer is yes, but only as long as economic growth stays solid.”\nEssaye noted that there was a data deluge last week, and the net result was that economic data and inflation remain “Goldilocks enough to help support stocks.”\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday’s reading on the economy, Bloomberg Economics estimates the US likely grew more than 3% in the third quarter, supported by robust consumer spending and modest investment gains — defying headwinds from tariff-related uncertainty.\n“The incoming economic data is second-tier at best, a fact that further reinforces the notion that rates will stay in an all-too-familiar territory as 2026 quickly approaches,” said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.\nCorporate Highlights:\nAlphabet Inc. has agreed to buy clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash, plus its existing debt, marking one of the largest deals by the tech giant in its push to dramatically expand its data center footprint to power AI.\nNvidia Corp. has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s Threads will launch podcast previews, or the ability to upload snippets of shows that play directly in user feeds, as part of a broader effort to encourage podcasters and their fans to spend more time on the social network, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nOpenAI has squeezed better margins out of its paid products this year, as it races to maintain its pole position in artificial intelligence, according to a report in The Information.\nTarget Corp., Whole Foods Market and Walmart Inc. will be added as defendants in lawsuits against baby formula maker ByHeart for selling a product potentially contaminated with spores that cause infant botulism.\nNetflix Inc. refinanced part of a $59 billion bridge loan with cheaper and longer-term debt, bolstering the financial package underpinning its bid for Warner Bros.

      "Content": "How Caterpillar Crushed the Magnificent 7 in 2025 — And It’s Not Done Yet!\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nQuick Read Caterpillar ( CAT ) rose 61% in 2025 to become the top Dow performer. Caterpillar outpaced six of the seven Magnificent 7 tech stocks.\nCaterpillar’s Energy and Transportation segment drove gains with Q3 power generation sales up 31% from AI data center demand.\nCaterpillar raised guidance to 5% to 7% annual sales growth through 2030 with adjusted operating margins reaching 21% to 25% at $100B sales.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate market headlines in 2025, many of the stocks most closely tied to the technology -- the Magnificent 7 stocks of Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) -- have shown volatility or lagged.\nSix of the seven have experienced mixed or negative returns at points throughout the year, with broad concerns over valuations, sector rotations, and sustainability weighing on performance. In contrast, one unexpected name has outperformed six of the seven: Caterpillar ( NYSE:CAT ), the heavy equipment manufacturer. On a total return basis (capital appreciation plus dividends), Caterpillar trails only Alphabet by about one percentage point or so as of last Friday's close. Yet less than two weeks ago, Caterpillar was even ahead of Alphabet in year-to-date gains.\n\nSo, how is a traditional industrial company easily outpacing some of the world's largest tech giants?\nCaterpillar's Strong 2025 Performance Caterpillar has risen approximately 61% in 2025 compared to Alphabet's roughly 62 % gain, leaving the heavy equipment manufacturer just behind the tech behemoth and with the potential to surpass it by year-end.\nIt also stands as the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , edging out Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) in second place, and significantly outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7, with only Nvidia, which has returned almost 35% this year, coming close.\n\nWhat Is Doing the Heavy Lifting for Caterpillar Caterpillar's outperformance stems from strong demand in its Energy and Transportation segment, particularly generators and power equipment for AI data centers and infrastructure. Partnerships like the one with Vertiv ( NYSE:VRT ) for data center power solutions have highlighted Caterpillar's role in supporting AI growth.\nEnduring global infrastructure spending and mining demand have also contributed, but the real standout has been in power generation and oil and gas, segments that saw sales rise 31% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nWeiterlesen\nTariffs posed challenges earlier in the year, with estimated costs up to $1.8 billion in 2025, but the company mitigated impacts through cost controls and pricing adjustments. Still, inflation continues to weigh on margins, with consolidated operating profits slipping 3%.\nHowever, these drivers that carried Caterpillar higher in 2025 appear sustainable into 2026, with analysts pointing to ongoing AI-related power needs and potential infrastructure rebounds. The risks of tariff escalation and cyclical slowdowns in construction or mining remain present.\n\nKey Takeaway Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar often deliver the best returns when bought during downturns to capture upside as cycles recover. Caterpillar began rising in late 2022, gained strongly in 2023, and delivered about 24% returns in 2024. In 2025, shares faltered on tariff fears in April before doubling from those lows.\n\nAt this point in the cycle, Caterpillar remains a solid holding, with tailwinds from AI infrastructure and global demand likely continuing into next year and beyond. Their strength allowed management to raise guidance for the next five years.\nCaterpillar is now expecting 5% to 7% compound annual sales growth through 2030, adjusted operating margins of 15% to 19% at $60 billion in sales and 21% to 25% at $100 billion in sales, and $6 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow—a 20% to 50% increase over prior estimates. While valuations are elevated with the stock trading well above its five-year average across most metrics, the structural shift toward power generation supports further gains rather than an imminent peak.\nAI's strong tailwinds will likely carry Caterpillar stock beyond the typical cyclical decline, and though investors should monitor economic indicators and keep an eye on whether AI is truly in a bubble phase or not, taking profits now may be premature given the outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "AI trade: Where risk is becoming apparent as 2025 closes out\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:26 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\nXLK\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, tastylive founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff and Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma examine Wall Street's outlook on the AI trade and dissecting where investors anticipate risk or slowdowns across the mega-cap tech landscape.\nSosnoff is also the co-founder and CEO of Lossdog.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian\nTom, I'd love to get your thoughts on what I just dumped out there into the uh internet sphere on what is driving this AI rally uh into the year end.\n00:10 Tom\nWell, you know, it's been an unbelievable year and so to this point, everybody that's been long AI stocks for the entire year, you know, they've gotten paid. So I just think it's a lack of sellers. I I'm not nearly as bullish as as you are going into January, but for now, I just think it's a lack of sellers.\n00:32 Brian\nUh why not? What gives you pause, Tom?\n00:37 Tom\nUh just price. I mean, if you're, you know, I'm I'm a pretty, I've been a pretty active trader for a long time and price is kind of everything. I don't really think about anything, you know, beyond price. and sometimes you get to the point where you're like, hey, it it just becomes a pot odds play, Brian. Where is there more risk? Is there more risk to staying long or is there a better payout being short? That's all it is.\n01:04 Brian\nIs there underneath the surface of let's say Nvidia, Tom and some of those well-known uh AI plays? Are there other areas of the market in in AI that are that are breaking down that that are red flags to you?\n01:15 Tom\nNo, not yet. I mean, I mean the the small caps, the small cap AI stocks are trailing a little bit, but not really and there's a lot of stocks in the pipeline that, you know, also look good that might come out as IPOs in 2026. But for the most part, I think it's just, it's just the mega tech, the mega tech stocks. It's it's the it's the big, too big to fail companies. And I think in that sense, that's where the real risk is.\n01:33 Brian\nBrooke, I mentioned here at the top that uh AI is back in rally mode. I call out Nvidia, Microsoft, but if if you dig down a little deeper, it's not every one of these stocks have been rocking the past five or even 10 trading sessions.\n01:46 Brooke\nYeah, if you take a look, there are some companies that are definitely pulling back some momentum. For example, we do have Oracle moving higher today, up about 1.2%, but if you take a look over the month, it's down about 2%. Over the past six months, down about 5% as we make our way into year end. And also, in addition to that, to take a look at some of the players that did go public this year. Take for example, we have uh another one like Core Weave moving higher today up about 3.5%. On the flip side, that stock up nearly 20% year uh or rather in the past month alone as we make our way into the end of the year. I think that investors are really trying to see how exactly they could still get into this this tech rally, still find those spots that maybe have been underperformers as of late in fear that they might miss out. I think we're seeing a bit of FOMO as we make our way into the later days and the last few days of this year's trading session.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Sterling Infrastructure and Taylor Morrison Home have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:34 AM PST 10 min read\n\nIn this article: STRL\n\nTSLA\n\nLCID\n\nTMHC\n\nF\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 22, 2025 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL as the Bull of the Day and Taylor Morrison Home Corp. TMHC asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tesla's TSLA, Lucid Group, Inc. LCID and Ford Motor Co. F .\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day : Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. is a leading U.S. infrastructure company that's become an under-the-radar Wall Street star over the past five years, posting massive growth on the back of converging megatrends.\nSterling is benefiting from the artificial intelligence data center boom, reshoring, energy industry expansion, and big spending across traditional infrastructure segments, such as roads and beyond.\n\nThe U.S. infrastructure standout, which already more than doubled its earnings between 2021 and 2024, is projected to nearly double its EPS again from 2024 to 2026 on the back of strong sales growth.\nSTRL's impressive upward earnings revisions trend earns it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). And it launched a new $400 million stock repurchase plan in November.\nThe AI infrastructure-boosted stock has soared over 80% in 2025 as part of a huge ~1,500% run in the last five years. Yet investors can buy the stock around 25% below its November records as it looks to find support at a key technical range.\nBuy Soaring AI Infrastructure Stock STRL Now and Hold Sterling is a Texas-based infrastructure standout that specializes in heavy civil and site development projects across three main segments: E-Infrastructure, Transportation, and Building Solutions. The firm focuses on the first phase of construction, from site selection to planning and site prep. Sterling boasts that it can \"scale to meet any size project.\"\n\nThe company's E-Infrastructure Solutions unit operates across large-scale site work for data centers, e-commerce warehouses, manufacturing, and energy. Its Transportation Solutions space, as the name suggests, is focused on highways, bridges, airports, rail, and more. Sterling's Building Solutions segment is centered around foundations and more for homes, parking structures, and commercial buildings.\nSterling is capitalizing on compounding megatrends across the U.S. that are just beginning. The company is riding long-term multi-decade upside across the AI data center boom and the rapid energy and grid expansion that's needed to support the AI age.\nOn top of that, the U.S. is reshoring critical industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on traditional infrastructure such as bridges and roads after decades of neglect.\n\nStory Continues\nThe firm is ready to grow directly from expansion across \"Mission&ndash;Critical Markets: Data Centers, Next Generation Manufacturing, Semiconductor Fabrication.\"\nInfrastructure Stock STRL's Huge Growth Upside STRL is landing \"mission-critical projects, including data centers and manufacturing.\" The company posted a huge beat-and-raise third quarter in early November, topping our Zacks EPS estimate by 25% and providing another round of strong guidance.\nIt also flexed its financial muscles and upside to shareholders by authorizing a new $400 million stock repurchase program. This backdrop is why all four brokerage recommendations Zacks has are \"Strong Buys.\"\n\nIt grew its signed backlog 34% YoY to $2.6 billion. \"With the addition of CEC, the aggregate of our combined backlog and high-probability future phase work gives us visibility into a pool of work totaling more than $4 billion,\" CEO Joe Cutillo said in prepared comments.\nSterling is projected to grow its revenue by 13% in 2025 and 19% next year to reach $2.84 billion, after averaging 14% revenue growth in the trailing five years.\nBetter yet, it is projected to expand its adjusted earnings by 71% this year and 15% next year to nearly double its bottom line from $6.10 in FY24 to $11.95 share in 2026.\nThe growth-heavy infrastructure company's earnings estimates have surged by 9% for 2025 and 2026 since its Q3 release to earn Sterling a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The recent positivity extends its impressive run of upward EPS revisions.\n\nIt's also worth stressing that STRL grew its GAAP earnings from $1.50 a share in 2020 to $8.28 in 2024.\nBuy this Market-Crushing Stock on the Dip for Upside and Value STRL has skyrocketed ~1,500% in the past five years to blow away its industry's 145% and the S&P 500's 85%. This is part of a much larger surge over the past 25 years. Sterling shares have climbed 80% in 2025, including its 25% drop from its early November records.\nThe stock jumped 7% on Thursday as the market and the broader AI everything trade rebounded after a mid-week selloff. It found buyers at the critical level highlighted in blue below.\n\nSterling trades around 35% below its average Zacks price target. The recent 25% pullback, mixed with its strong earnings outlook, has it trading not too far above its industry and the S&P 500 (both around 22.8X) at 25X forward 12-month earnings. This marks impressive value considering STRL has crushed both over the last five and 25 years.\nBear of the Day: Taylor Morrison Home Corp. is a national land developer and homebuilder giant that's seen its earnings revisions tumble over the last year based on a multitude of headwinds.\nTMHC's recent negative earnings per share (EPS) revisions earn the homebuilder a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The company's near-term outlook remains strained, given the industry and economy-wide setbacks it is facing.\n\nShould Investors Stay Away from TMHC Stock for Now? Taylor Morrison is one of the largest U.S. homebuilders. The Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered firm designs, builds, and sells single-family homes, ranging from first-time/entry-level to move-up and luxury/resort-style. TMHC posted booming revenue growth between 2013 and 2022, highlighted by 29% expansion in 2020 and 22% growth in 2021.\n\nThe wild Covid-driven housing boom created a massive pull forward across the home-buying market. The market also benefited from a buyer-friendly low mortgage rate environment.\nThe housing market has cooled significantly since then as home prices and mortgage rates soared.\nTaylor Morrison is projected to see its revenue fall 2.4% in 2025 and then fade 6.5% next year. Its adjusted earnings are expected to drop 5.5% and 12.5%, respectively.\nThe company's earnings estimate has dropped 21% for Q4 since its last report and 13% for 2026. TMHC's downbeat earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and extend its downward run that began in late 2024.\nThat said, the homebuilder's long-term outlook likely remains firmly intact given the dire need for more housing inventory in the U.S. \"Encouragingly, net absorption paces improved each month during the quarter, in contrast to typical seasonal slowing into the end of summer as the improvement in mortgage interest rates helped spur activity,\" CEO Sheryl Palmer said in prepared Q3 remarks in October.\n\n\"Going forward, we believe strengthened consumer confidence is critical to further stabilizing demand, especially for discretionary home purchase decisions in our move-up and resort lifestyle communities.\"\nIn the near term, persistently high mortgage rates could continue to suppress demand, leading to slower home sales, increased cancellations, and pressure on margins if TMHC is forced to rely more on incentives to move inventory.\nTaylor Morrison doesn't pay a dividend, and its Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the bottom 10% of 240 Zacks industries. This is worth stressing since studies have shown that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to a stock's industry group.\nInvestors might want to stay away from Taylor Morrison for now since the housing market remains under stress.\n\nAdditional content: How Strong Is Tesla's Lead Over Rival EVs in the UK? Tesla 's Model Y and Model 3 continue to dominate electric vehicle sales in the United Kingdom with about two weeks left in the year by a wide margin, per Teslarati.\nThe Model Y leads with 18,890 units sold so far this year, followed by the Model 3 at 16,361, per data from EU-EVs. The closest competitor, the Audi Q4 e-tron, trails well behind at 10,287 units, though it still outpaces models such as the BMW i4 and Audi Q6 e-tron.\n\nWhile the Model Y has performed strongly worldwide, it has been especially dominant in major markets like Europe and the United States. Its appeal has long stemmed from a blend of premium features, interior space and an emphasis on sustainability that aligns closely with consumer preferences.\nBoth Tesla models are expected to post lower sales than in 2024, per Teslarati. Last year, the Model Y topped the U.K. market with 32,610 units sold, while the Model 3 reached 17,272 units, which puts this year's Model 3 sales roughly in line with last year's pace.\nOverall, Tesla sold 50,090 vehicles in the United Kingdom in 2024, but is currently about 8,000 units behind that pace. The company's market share has also declined from 13.2% last year to 9.6% with two weeks left in 2025. Even so, Tesla remains the market leader, ahead of Volkswagen's 8% share. TSLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nTSLA's Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Tesla has outperformed the Zacks Automotive-Domestic industry and its peers, Lucid Group, Inc. sand Ford Motor Co. , in the past six months. TSLA's shares have gained 49.8% compared with the industry's growth of 45.6%. Shares of LCID have plunged 47.7%, while shares of Ford have gained 25.8% in the same period.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, TSLA appears overvalued compared to the industry and peers. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 15.23, higher than the industry's 3.48. Lucid is trading at a forward P/S ratio of 1.7, while Ford is trading at 0.32.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA's 2025 EPS has fallen 5 cents in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA's 2026 earnings per share has fallen a penny in the past seven days.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Waymo’s Disaster Helps Tesla\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nGM\n\nWaymo, the Alphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) autonomous driving operation, is widely considered the leader in the advance of self-driving car technology. Many believe its product is ahead of those of Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ), GM, and Ford. Waymo-powered cars have logged over 100 million “fully autonomous miles.” It now operates, or will soon, in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, Miami, District of Columbia, and Dallas. It also has limited tests in Tokyo.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points An incident during the recent blackout in San Francisco has harmed Waymo’s image as the self-driving leader.\nElon Musk took the opportunity to boast about Tesla’s self-driving technology.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAn incident during the recent blackout in San Francisco shattered Waymo’s image. According to The New York Times, “Waymo Suspended Service in San Francisco After Its Cars Stalled During Power Outage.” The vehicles stopped when traffic lights went out. Fortunately, that resulted in no injuries.\nTesla is betting heavily on its own self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk posted on X, “SAN FRAN BLACKOUT – WAYMO FROZE, TESLA DROVE Waymo’s robotaxis got a little too real last night - by completely shutting down when San Francisco’s power outage knocked out traffic lights.”\nTesla claims it will be the leader in the sector, despite skeptics whose opinions have largely been fueled by Waymo’s success. Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving (FSD)” is already in a number of its vehicles. However, to use it, drivers must keep their eyes on the road. Tesla’s first test of its self-driving robotaxi started in Austin early this year. Tesla plans to move into San Francisco, then to begin testing in Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and Miami.\n\nIt is an open question whether the Waymo problem is part of a temporary defect in its product. Yet, it would be hard to find an incident that would hurt it more or help Tesla’s chances, at least in the court of public opinion and among some experts.\nMusk has repeatedly bragged that no one can match his autonomous vehicle technology. Waymo had undermined that claim. According to CNBC, “Alphabet-owned Waymo kept expanding and dominated the robotaxi market in the U.S., though rivals Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox also launched the first versions of their services in 2025.”\nMusk’s comments about its self-driving future have been part of the rise in its share price since April. Waymo has given investors another reason to buy Tesla shares.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Elon Musk Is About To Be the World’s First Trillionaire. That May Not Be Because of Tesla.\n\nChris MacDonald\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:58 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nLove him or hate him, there's no denying that in terms of world-class entrepreneurs that have been able to spot long-duration and very sustainable high-growth markets to build businesses in, Elon Musk is one of the greats.\nQuick Read SpaceX is interviewing bankers for an IPO that could value the company at $1.5 trillion.\nMusk owns 42% of SpaceX. A $1.5 trillion valuation would make his stake worth $630B.\nHis Tesla stake is worth roughly $250B based on the company’s $1.6 trillion market cap.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) CEO has rose to fame via making electric vehicles (once a fantasy, similar to flying cars) a reality. Driving down the road, I see dozens every day. And I'd expect to have seen even more, if the Obama-era subsidies for electric vehicles got maintained by this recent administration - spoiler alert, they didn't.\nIt's true that Musk's stake in Tesla, now worth $1.6 trillion, amounts to around 15.3% of Tesla's outstanding share count. At the company's current valuation, that puts his holdings at around $250 billion in Tesla alone - a tidy sum.\nThat said, his biggest equity investment actually isn't in Tesla. Here's what could drive an absolutely massive pay day for Elon Musk (outside of his potential trillion-dollar pay package investors just approved).\n\nSpaceX IPO Could Significantly Boost Musk's Net Worth SpaceX building\nOutside of other endeavors, from his purchase of social media platform Twitter (now X), to AI, robotics and other high-growth areas Musk is trying to build businesses, there's a lot to keep track of when trying to pencil in his actual net worth right now.\nAnd because so much of his net worth is tied up in private companies, such as SpaceX, there's been plenty of experts who have tried to nail down his exact net worth. The thing is, private valuations fluctuate significantly, and until these companies go public, it's impossible to know with exact certainty what he's really worth.\n\nWell, the day appears to be nearing when SpaceX will go public, with the company interviewing bankers for an IPO in short order. This IPO could raise as much as $1.15 trillion based on the most recent estimates from analysts. That said, if SpaceX were to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion (as some think is possible, given the company's Starlink and ties to the U.S. government), Musk's 42% ownership stake in the company would be worth around $630 billion. That stake, in combination with his other holdings, would get him to a $1 trillion net worth much faster than he may (or may not) achieve the lofty goals the Tesla board has set at his feet.\n\nStory Continues\nSo, Is It Possible? Man thinking with a question mark above his head\nGiven where valuations are in certain high-growth areas of the economy, a valuation of $1.5 trillion isn't insane for SpaceX at all. That goes double when investors put this space exploration and satellite launch company next to Tesla. There's reason to believe that SpaceX could grow much faster than Tesla (and do so more profitably), so I'd imagine investors will be very much on board for this IPO when it happens.\n\nI'm expecting to see \"the world's first trillionaire\" headlines soon, and Elon Musk will very likely be the man to hold this mantle.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is a Buy at Citizens on Waymo Operational Progress as RBC Capital Downplays Real Estate Prospects\n\nNeha Gupta\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:39 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is one of the best forever stocks to buy according to hedge funds . On December 17, analysts at Citizens reiterated that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a Market Outperform with a $340 price target. The positive stance is in response to Waymo’s third-quarter operational update.\nThe autonomous driving subsidiary says its cumulative rider miles increased by 28 million in the third quarter, representing 24% quarter-over-quarter growth. Phoenix has emerged as the subsidiary’s biggest market, where the unit added 10 million rider-only miles. The milestone comes as the unit plans to raise more than $15 billion at a valuation of about $100 billion.\n\nThe valuation underscores Waymo’s emergence as a leader in driverless technology as the company continues to ramp up its fleet. Backed by Alphabet, Waymo remains in a solid position to take on Tesla and others in the autonomous ride-hailing business. It is currently the only company without a safety driver across multiple cities.\nMeanwhile, RBC Capital does not expect Alphabet to enter the real estate portal market. According to the research firm, the company faces significant barriers to entry, key among them being the MLS participation requirement. For starters, IDX feeds are designed for agents, not horizontal marketing platforms, which makes MLS approval problematic. To participate Google will have to become a broker in hundreds of MLS organizations.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a multinational tech conglomerate and holding company, best known as the parent of Google, managing core internet services (Search, Ads, YouTube, Android, Maps) under Google. It also boasts of other ventures like cloud computing (Google Cloud), hardware (Pixel, Nest), and “Other Bets” in areas like self-driving cars (Waymo) and life sciences (Calico).\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Tornetta, who had accused Musk and the board of breaching their fiduciary duties.\nWhile the Supreme Court restored the pay package, it left intact other findings from the Court of Chancery, including conclusions about Musk’s influence over Tesla and flaws in the board’s approval process.\nLegal experts believe the ruling closes the dispute over Musk’s 2018 compensation but does not undo broader governance criticisms.\nAfter the original ruling, Tesla moved its incorporation out of Delaware and sought to reaffirm Musk’s pay through a second shareholder vote.\nInvestors later approved an even larger compensation package in November 2025, tied to aggressive performance milestones over the next decade.\nRelated articles\nTesla shares gain after court ruling over Musk pay package\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The Tesla ( TSLA , Financials ) CEO's fortune jumped after the Delaware Supreme Court reinstated his long-disputed 2018 pay package, valued at roughly $139 billion.\nWarning!

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe move pushed Musk's total wealth to around $749 billion, according to Forbes, making him the richest person in the world by an even wider margin.\nThe ruling overturned a 2024 decision that had voided the deal as excessive. The state's high court said the earlier ruling went too far, adding that Tesla shareholders had approved the compensation and that Musk hadn't been paid for six years while building the company's growth story.\nMusk's wealth has been on a rocket-like trajectory in recent months. SpaceX's rising valuation ahead of a potential 2026 IPO and Tesla's growing push into AI and robotics have fueled investor excitement.\nIn November, shareholders also reaffirmed their support for Musk's record-breaking $1 trillion incentive plan.

      "Content": "Should You Buy Tesla Stock Before Jan. 2?\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:39 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Tesla is one of the world's largest manufacturers of electric vehicles (EVs), but it's struggling to compete with more affordable brands.\nThe company will report its EV sales numbers for the fourth quarter of 2025 on or around Jan. 2, and they are likely to cap off a very weak year.\nTesla stock is trading at a sky-high valuation, which makes it a very difficult investment right now.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is on track to end 2025 with a gain of over 25%, and it's currently trading near a record high. Investors have piled into the stock in anticipation of the company's future product platforms, like the Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot, which are both set to launch over the next couple of years.\nHowever, over 70% of Tesla's revenue still comes from selling electric vehicles (EVs), and this critical part of its business is suffering from weak demand right now, driven by a sharp increase in global competition. On or around Jan. 2, the company will release its EV delivery numbers for the fourth quarter of 2025, which could help determine the direction of its stock in the near term.\nShould you invest in Tesla ahead of the report?\nTwo straight years of declining EV sales Tesla delivered 1.79 million EVs in 2024, which was down 1% compared to the previous year. It was the company's first annual sales decline since it launched its flagship Model S in 2011. But the weakness accelerated in 2025, with Tesla's deliveries sinking by 6% year over year through the first three quarters (ended Sept. 30).\n\nAccording to FactSet, Wall Street expects Tesla to have delivered around 450,000 EVs during the fourth quarter (ending Dec. 31). This would take its annual total for 2025 to 1.67 million, representing a 7% decline compared to 2024.\nCompetition is one of Tesla's biggest challenges right now, especially in key markets like China and Europe. Consumers are opting for low-cost options from manufacturers like BYD , which sell EVs at a price point Tesla simply can't match. For example, BYD's entry-level Dolphin Surf EV sells for just $26,900 in Europe, whereas Tesla's Model 3 starts at $44,300.\nAs a result, Tesla's EV sales declined by 12% year over year across Europe during November alone. If we exclude Norway, where sales benefited from the upcoming expiry of an EV tax credit, Tesla's European sales in November were actually down by over 36%. The company's market share across Europe is now just 1.6%, down from 2.4% last year.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla stock trades at a ludicrous valuation Tesla's weak EV sales have fueled a steep decline in its profits this year, yet its stock continues to climb, resulting in a sky-high valuation. Based on the company's trailing-12-month earnings of $1.44 per share, its stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 322 as I write this.\nThat makes Tesla almost 10 times more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 technology index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 33. It also makes Tesla the most expensive American stock in the exclusive $1 trillion club -- and it's not even close.\nBased on its valuation alone, it's very hard to make an argument for buying Tesla stock ahead of Jan. 2. Even if the company delivers far more cars than expected, it still won't be enough to justify its sky-high P/E ratio. In fact, its stock would have to decline by 78% just to trade in line with the P/E ratio of the next-most-expensive stock in the trillion-dollar club, Broadcom .\n\nWhy are investors paying a hefty premium for Tesla stock? Tesla's Cybercab autonomous robotaxi is expected to enter mass production in 2026. It will run on the company's full self-driving (FSD) software, so it will be able to haul passengers around the clock, creating a potentially lucrative revenue stream. Wall Street firms, like Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management, think this could become Tesla's biggest source of revenue in the future.\n\nHowever, Tesla's FSD software isn't approved for unsupervised use anywhere in the U.S. yet (although approval in California is reportedly close), so the company's robotaxi program is already falling behind the competition. Alphabet 's Waymo, for example, developed a robotaxi that is already completing over 450,000 paid autonomous trips every single week across five U.S. cities.\nThen there is the Optimus humanoid robot, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk believes could generate $10 trillion in revenue for the company over the long term. He thinks humanoid robots will outnumber humans by 2040 because they will have applications in businesses and households alike.\nHowever, Optimus is even further away than the Cybercab in terms of commercialization. Musk thinks the latest version, Optimus 3, probably won't enter mass production until the end of 2026, but he expects to scale to 1 million annual units relatively quickly.\n\nEven though these new products present Tesla with extremely valuable opportunities, neither of them will be a factor before the company's upcoming EV deliveries announcement on Jan. 2. Since they are still a couple of years away from contributing meaningful revenues, I think there is a risk that Tesla stock will suffer a sharp correction in the meantime.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Where Tesla has long dominated in sheer scale and brand recognition, Rivian is carving out its own niche and differentiating factors in electric vehicles . Rivian's stock has struggled since the company went public in November 2021. Since then, the stock has lost more than 80% of its value. So the question remains, is there a future for Rivian?\nThe short answer: Yes, there could possibly be a bright future ahead for the EV maker, but it's going to depend largely on its continued operational streamlining and the successful launch of the R2 fleet in 2026.\nRivian is well-liked among customers Rivian consistently ranks among the top EVs in performance, design, and reputation. The company has also cultivated a loyal customer base. Rivian also controls most of its tech stack, which is a huge competitive advantage against EV rivals outside of Tesla.

      "Content": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other S&P 500 Company. Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\nGOING GLOBAL\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Yan said, Chinese manufacturers face risks from U.S. restrictions on projects receiving investment tax credits that involve designated \"foreign entities of concern\", which include China.\nPOWER MARKET SHAKE-UP\nChina's battery exports, including for EVs and energy storage, hit a record $66.761 billion in the first 10 months of the year, according to data from energy think tank Ember. Batteries have been China's most lucrative clean-technology export since 2022, surpassing solar photovoltaics.\n\nThat is likely to grow again next year, as consultancy Infolink anticipates global energy storage cell shipments could rise to 800 gigawatt-hours, a 33% to 43% increase from this year's forecasts.\nChina's exports of energy storage and other non-automotive batteries rose 51.4% in the first 11 months from the same period last year, faster than the 40.6% growth in EV battery exports, according to the China ⁠Electric Vehicle Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance.\nChina already has the world's largest battery energy storage fleet - some 40% of the ​global total - driven in part by local government mandates for developers to add storage to wind and solar projects. China's ​battery storage this year overtook its capacity of conventional pumped hydro, a geographically more limited technology that uses water stored behind dams to generate electricity when needed.\n\nHowever, much of that battery storage capacity has sat idle because it was not profitable to operate.\nThat model is changing with reforms in June that required newly built projects to ‍sell their power through market-based auctions, instead of at ⁠a fixed rate. As a result, it has become more profitable to run a storage plant that profits by recharging when prices are low and discharging when prices are high.\nEnergy storage plants ran longer in the third quarter, after the reforms passed, hitting an average 3.08 hours per day, up 0.78 hours from a year earlier and up 0.23 hours from the previous ⁠three months, according to the China Electricity Council.\nThis is happening against the backdrop of a new $35 billion government plan to nearly double battery storage by 2027 as well as new provincial-level subsidies. Since late 2024, 10 Chinese provinces have rolled out ‌capacity tariffs - special payments for providers to keep capacity on standby - in addition to other subsidies, according to Jefferies.\nIt is \"the most decisive policy shift for energy storage in over ‌a decade\", Jefferies analyst Johnson Wan wrote in a note.\n(Reporting by Colleen Howe; Editing by William Mallard)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "As EU waters down 2035 EV goals, electric startups express concern\n\nAnna Heim\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThe future may be electric, but that future is being postponed. The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.\nInstead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate. This change is part of a broader ‘ Automotive Package ‘ designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive.\n\nIf the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors.\n“China already dominates EV manufacturing,” said Craig Douglas, a partner at World Fund, a European climate-focused venture capital firm. “If Europe doesn’t compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.”\nDouglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Senior executives from companies including Cabify, EDF, Einride, Iberdrola, and numerous EV-related startups signed the letter, exhorting the Commission to “stand firm” on the original 2035 zero-emission target.\n\nTheir appeal wasn’t enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. But continuing pressure has sparked debate within the startup community and beyond about the best path for Europe if it’s to remain competitive during the energy transition.\nIndustry split on timeline\nEven within the auto industry, opinions differ. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for many years to come.”\nUnlike Mercedes-Benz and other manufacturers, the Swedish carmaker had no concerns about meeting the 2035 ban. Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage.\n\nIssam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. “History shows that this kind of flexibility has never worked out well,” said Tidjani, who also signed the Take Charge Europe letter this fall. “It delays scale, weakens learning curves, and ultimately costs industrial leadership rather than preserving it.”\n\nStory Continues\nTo be fair, the Commission hasn’t completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security.\n\nThe plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The company, hoping to succeed where Swedish battery maker Northvolt struggled, opened its first large-scale battery factory in Northern France this week. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe’s battery industry.”\nMixed signals\nStill, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU’s commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.\nAlready, traditional carmakers have begun complaining that the carbon offset requirements could make cars more expensive for consumers, potentially undermining the very competitiveness the policy change was meant to protect.\n\nAnother uncertainty involves the United Kingdom. It’s unclear whether the U.K. will follow the EU’s lead and modify its own 2035 combustion engine ban. Unlike both the European Union and the United States, the U.K. hasn’t yet imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, despite that their rapidly increasing sales in the British market have raised concerns among domestic manufacturers.\nThe debate highlights ongoing tensions in climate policy between how to balance the economic realities facing existing industries with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner tech. As Europe tries to thread this needle, the decisions made now will invariably impact whether the continent leads or lags in the global EV market.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Wedbush Lowers PT on Uber Technologies (UBER) to $78 From $84\n\nNoor Ul Ain Rehman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: UBER\n\nTSLA\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: UBER ) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds in 2025 . Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) received a rating update from Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt on December 19, who slashed the price target on the stock to $78 from $84 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares.\nIn addition, Bernstein analyst Nikhil Devnani reaffirmed a Buy rating on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) on December 18 and lifted the price target to $115.00 from $110.00. The analyst based the rating update on various factors, including the company’s strategic positioning in the developing autonomous vehicles landscape, growth outlook, and valuation.\n\nDevnani noted that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is trading at a discounted multiple compared to its earnings power despite competitive noise and increased headlines from peers like Tesla, Waymo, and Zoox, which points towards the market’s overreaction to near-term AV concerns.\nHe added that the long-term market is expected to paint a fragmented picture among AV players, a structure that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) can benefit from because of its platform scale and balance-sheet flexibility. This makes the recent pullback a favorable entry point for investors, according to the analyst.\nDevnani further stated that while Uber Technologies, Inc.’s (NYSE:UBER) ongoing investments in its core Mobility and Delivery operations and autonomous vehicle partnerships may constrain incremental margins temporarily, the prospect is likely to support stronger EBITDA outperformance and solid gross bookings growth over time.\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) operates as a technology platform that offers ride services and merchant delivery service providers for food, groceries, meal preparation, and other delivery services. The company’s operations are divided into Delivery, Mobility, and Freight. The Delivery segment allows users to order food, while the Mobility segment provides access to Mobility Drivers who provide rides in various vehicles. The Freight segment connects Carriers and Shippers.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

She recently did some notable buying of another top holding of Ark that’s been struggling.\n\nWood gained a reputation after the Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. Year to date, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF ( ARKK ) is up 39.39% as of Dec. 19, far outpacing the S&P 500 ’s gain of 16.2% in the same period.\nWood’s style brings sweet wins in rising markets but also painful losses in bearish ones, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term results. As of Dec. 18, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -8.72%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 14.48% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar .\nCathie Wood rejects “AI bubble” Wood’s strategy is simple: her Ark ETFs focus on emerging high-tech companies in areas like artificial intelligence, blockchain , biomedical technology, and robotics.\nWood views these businesses as potential forces for big changes and long-term growth, though their volatility often brings fluctuations to the Ark’s funds.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood's net worth: The Ark Invest CEO's wealth & income\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott . That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.\nIn October, Wood said in a CNBC interview that she expects to see a market “shudder” as interest rates begin to rise.\nStill, Wood believes in the potential of AI , denying the “AI bubble” talk amid concerns about the high valuations of tech stocks.\n“I do not believe AI is in a bubble,” Wood said. “ What I do think is, on the enterprise side, it is going to take a while for large corporations to prepare themselves to transform…in order to really capitalize on the productivity gains that we think are going to be unleashed by AI.”\n\nNot all investors agree with Wood. In the 12 months through Dec. 18, the Ark Innovation ETF saw roughly $1.28 billion in net outflows, according to ETF research firm VettaFi .\nCathie Wood buys $26.1 million of Coinbase stock On Dec. 15, 17, and 18, Wood’s Ark funds bought 106,530 shares of Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ), valued at about $26.1 million.\nThe purchases extend a gradual build that began in mid-November.\nEarlier this year, Wood bought roughly 34,500 Coinbase shares during the first quarter, then sold roughly 446,000 shares and another 228,000 in the following two quarters, according to Stockcircle’s data .\n\nIn 2024, Wood unloaded a total of about 5.5 million Coinbase shares across the year, making it a full year of net selling.\nDespite those selling, Coinbase is Wood’s fourth-largest holding of the Ark Innovation ETF.\nTop 10 holdings of the Ark Innovation ETF as of Dec. 19, 2025: Tesla ( TSLA ) 12.32%\nRoku ( ROKU ) 5.89%\nCRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP ) 5.47%\nCoinbase Global (COIN) 5.28%\nShopify ( SHOP ) 5.27%\nRobinhood Markets ( HOOD ) 4.48%\nTempus AI ( TEM ) 4.44%\nPalantir Technologies ( PLTR ) 3.90%\nRoblox ( RBLX ) 3.54%\nAdvanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) 3.22%\nCoinbase runs the biggest crypto exchange in the U.S. and generates revenue through transaction fees from cryptocurrency trading on its platform.\n\nCoinbase’s stock price is closely tied to the price of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin rises, trading activity usually picks up, which helps Coinbase through higher transaction revenue and better sentiment toward crypto stocks. When it falls, trading slows and Coinbase shares could face pressure.\nYear to date, Coinbase stock is down 3%, while Bitcoin lost 5.6%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 index, which gained more than 16% over the same period.\nOn Dec. 17, Coinbase announced that it will roll out stock trading to U.S. users, allowing customers to trade stocks and ETFs alongside crypto within the same app, which reduces its reliance on crypto trading and positions it as a direct rival to brokerages such as Robinhood (HOOD).\nCantor Fitzgerald lowered its price target on Coinbase to $320 from $459 while keeping an overweight rating following the announcement, Thefly reported.\n\nThe firm said Coinbase’s update highlighted its push to become an “everything exchange,” which is strategically positive. But near-term revenue and profitability estimates are being lowered due to recent crypto sentiment declines.\nThe firm also warned that the 2026 consensus assumption for 14% trading volume growth could be overly optimistic if the market enters another crypto winter .\nOn Bitcoin, Wood says Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, which means mining rewards are cut roughly every four years, may no longer be effective, and we may have already seen the lowest point of this cycle.\n“The volatility’s going down,” she said on Fox Business on Dec. 9, adding that institutions “are going to prevent much more of a decline” and that “we may have seen the low a couple of weeks ago.”\nWood also argues that the market’s behavior has shifted, as Bitcoin trades more like a risk-on asset, moving in line with equities and real estate rather than acting as a hedge.\n“Now, gold is more of a risk-off asset,” she said.\nRelated: Cathie Wood sells $40 million of megacap tech stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Elon Musk Weighs In After 'Serial Google Hater' Drops $1 Million On Alphabet Stock: 'Hardware Is The End Game'\n\nVishaal Sanjay\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 5:31 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO, Elon Musk , weighed in on a post praising Google-parent Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) new hardware play, and the company’s reemergence as the dominant player in the ongoing AI race.\nLong-Time Google Critic Turns Investor On Thursday, in a post on X, serial AI entrepreneur and digital nomad Pieter Levels , who goes by the name Levelsio , announced that he had purchased over $1 million in Alphabet shares, after being “the biggest Google hater for years.”\nLevels said the company had been “completely mismanaged” for years and was “destroyed by politics and lack of any leadership,” before undergoing a turnaround that he attributed to the return of co-founder Sergey Brin , whom he described as the “de facto CEO.”\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nAccording to Levels, Google is now “dominating not just in the AI benchmarks and leaderboards but in real usage,” while pointing out that “AI benchmarks can, and are easily rigged.”\nHe pointed to Google's proprietary tensor processing units, massive data advantages through YouTube, Google Images and web search, and what he described as renewed engineering leadership under Brin for his investment decision, and why he thinks the company is now set to lead the AI race.\n“It’s really just Google and Elon Musk and the Chinese in the end who will probably win,” Levels said, adding that he only relies on models from Google, Musk’s xAI, and Chinese firms such as ByteDance , Kling and Minimax .\nLevels, the founder of PhotoAI, InteriorAI and RemoteOK, also said that he had trimmed his holdings in NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) months earlier, noting that competition in AI chips was “inevitable,” with Google's TPUs now offering a credible alternative.\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nHardware Is ‘The End Game,’ Says Musk Musk responded Levels’ post on X with a single line, saying, “Hardware is the end game.” This comes amid Tesla’s growing in-house AI chip program , which Musk plans to scale going forward.\n“We expect to build chips at higher volumes ultimately than all other AI chips combined. Read that sentence again, as I’m not kidding,” Musk said last month.\n\nStory Continues\nSenior Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has labeled Tesla one of the market's leading \"physical AI plays,\" citing the company's push to translate AI into physical systems, such as with its autonomous vehicles, robotaxis and even the Optimus humanoid robots.\nShares of Google were up 1.91% on Thursday, closing at $303.75, and are up 0.47% overnight, while Tesla is up 3.45%, at $483.37, and up 0.43% overnight.\n\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Be Worth More Than $2 Trillion by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Tesla is operating in a difficult environment.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are providing computing units for the AI build-out.\nMeta Platforms' stock was slammed due to spending plans.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nThere are currently five stocks that have a valuation of $2 trillion or more. Outside of these five, only a handful of others are in a position to be worth $2 trillion or more in 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nThe next largest company is Berkshire Hathaway , which has a market cap of about $1 trillion. For that stock to double would be a huge feat, especially without Warren Buffett at the helm, so let's put it aside.\nNow we're left with Meta, Tesla, Broadcom, and TSMC. Which of these will make it to $2 trillion by the end of 2026?\nAll will beat the market if they reach $2 trillion by 2026 The largest is Meta Platforms, sitting at a $1.66 trillion valuation. The smallest is Taiwan Semiconductor at $1.49 billion. That places all four of these stocks in relatively close proximity to each other, which means the required return is fairly similar. Meta would need to rise 21% while Taiwan Semiconductor must rise 34%. Both of these potential performance figures would indicate a market-beating stock, so if any of these companies can breach the $2 trillion threshold, they will likely be great to own.\nThe $2 trillion threshold is also uncharted territory for this group. Both Meta and Broadcom have come close, but neither has crossed into the $2 trillion zone.\nI think three will make it, while one will be left out If you sort the companies by growth rates, it's clear that there's one outlier: Tesla.\nIt's no secret that Tesla is struggling in the current environment, due to electric vehicle (EV) credits ending from the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the other three are posting incredible growth rates that don't look to be slowing down anytime soon in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips in the artificial intelligence supply chain. Without its production capabilities, none of the AI computing power we know now would be possible. Demand for AI chips isn't slowing down, and Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to continue growing at a rapid 21% pace in 2026, according to Wall Street analysts. However, these analysts have consistently underestimated Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the past few years, so don't be surprised if TSMC outperforms these expectations. Couple that with the second-cheapest valuation in this group, and Taiwan Semiconductor should reach the $2 trillion mark in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms nearly entered the $2 trillion club, but pulled back following a poorly received third-quarter earnings report. While the business's performance was incredible, investors didn't like Meta's massive spending plans. There is growing concern that Meta is overextending itself, which is why investors have started selling off the stock. However, I think Meta is just the first company to max out its cash flows being devoted to AI computing capacity, and it won't be the last. The market will come back around to Meta's stock in 2026 and will send it back to levels allowing it to reach the $2 trillion point.\n\nLast is Broadcom, which also sold off due to 2026 guidance. Wall Street wanted greater visibility into faster AI growth, and Broadcom told investors they needed to be patient. Still, Broadcom informed investors that its Q4 AI revenue was $6.5 billion, up 74% year over year, and that it projects Q1's growth to be north of 100%. Broadcom is a much larger business than just AI, and the business isn't nearly as successful in those endeavors. Still, I think sustained growth from its custom AI computing units will drive Broadcom's stock higher in 2026, allowing it to reach the $2 trillion threshold.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil. Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ), Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN ), and Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: SLMT ).\nThe Tesla Trade Ark Invest executed a notable transaction by selling 23,110 shares of Tesla through its ARK Innovation ETF (BATS: ARKK ). The sale, valued at approximately $11.2 million, comes amid a backdrop of Tesla’s stock pulling back after reaching all-time highs earlier in the week.\nTesla’s shares have been experiencing volatility, with investors closely watching the company’s autonomous driving advancements.\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nHave $100k+ to invest?

This movement reflects ongoing market interest, even as Ark adjusts its holdings in the electric vehicle giant.\nThe Coinbase Trade Ark Invest also made a strategic purchase of Coinbase shares across its ARK Blockchain & Fintech Innovation ETF (BATS: ARKF ), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (BATS: ARKW ) and ARKK . The combined acquisition of 17,386 shares is valued at approximately $4.15 million. This move aligns with Coinbase’s recent announcement of launching traditional stock trading, as detailed in a Benzinga article .\n\nCoinbase announced it would launch commission-free U.S. stock trading with 24-hour access five days a week, expanding beyond its crypto-only roots. The company positioned the move as a step toward becoming a single platform for both digital assets and traditional equities, while laying groundwork for future tokenized stocks. Management said regulatory constraints required starting with conventional stock trading before pursuing blockchain-based equities. The expansion aimed to diversify revenue and reduce dependence on volatile crypto trading cycles.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThe Brera Holdings Trade Ark Invest significantly increased its stake in Brera Holdings by purchasing a total of 575,644 shares through its ARKW , ARKF and ARKK ETFs.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) Cybercab was recently spotted testing in Austin amid CEO Elon Musk 's driverless operations goal .\nCybercab In Austin On Thursday, influencer Sawyer Merritt took to the social media platform X, sharing pictures of a Cybercab in gold with Texas registration plates being driven around the streets of Austin.\nTesla didn't immediately respond to Benzinga 's request for comment.\nRecently, a Model Y Robotaxi was also spotted in Austin operating on the streets autonomously, sparking claims that the Austin Robotaxi fleet would be going driverless soon. Musk later confirmed that testing was underway in the city.\n\"The future is autonomous,\" Merritt said, adding that it was the first time the cab was being tested on Austin roads.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nDan O'Dowd Slams Cybercab The Dawn Project founder, Dan O'Dowd , took to the social media platform X on Thursday, sharing a video of a Cybercab being driven by a human driver on the road with a steering wheel and pedals, sharing that Tesla \"cultists\" were getting excited about the Cybercab.\n\"This is supposed to be Tesla’s purpose-built robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals,\" O'Dowd said. He then took a sarcastic jibe at the Cybercab for having a steering wheel and pedals and \"being driven manually by a human being!\"\nIt's worth noting that the Cybercab shown in the video by O'Dowd has California registration plates and was first seen after a video was posted on X late last month. It is not the same unit of the Cybercab spotted in Austin, though it cannot be verified at this moment if the Austin unit was also being piloted by a human driver.\n\nCybercab With Steering And Pedals Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm had earlier shared that the company could manufacture a Cybercab with steering wheels and pedals to meet regulatory rules.

      "Content": "Cathie Wood trims $11.2 million in longtime favorite stock\n\nMoz Farooque\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 10:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla ( TSLA ) stock has been performing exceptionally well lately.\nShares have surged nearly 50% over the past six months , driven by optimism surrounding autonomous driving, AI , and the EV giant’s long-term growth prospects.\nFor most, the rally is a confirmation that the worst might be over, despite the sluggishness in the company’s underlying business.\n\nThat’s exactly what makes Cathie Wood ’s latest move stand out.\nEven with Tesla's climb, the ARK Invest boss trimmed positions, selling roughly $11.2 million worth of shares in a single day (Dec. 18).\nNaturally, with Tesla being a longtime favorite for Wood, it’s the kind of decision that sparks instant speculation .\nHowever, selling doesn’t necessarily point to surrender.\nIt also reflects discipline, valuation-related troubles, or simple portfolio management following a superb run-up.\nAlso, Wood isn’t the only one at a crossroads.\nWall Street ’s view of Tesla stock is largely divided, with optimism over AI pitted against concerns over margins, execution, and how much the good news has already been priced in.\nCathie Wood’s Tesla trimming looks deliberate, not dramatic Wood’s ARK Invest sold off 23,110 shares of Tesla , valued at nearly $11.2 million on Dec. 18.\nThe move fits a pattern that has become clear over the past two to three months.\nARK’s approach appears to be more akin to position sizing and profit-taking following a massive rally, rather than a change in long-term conviction. Tesla remains ARK’s largest holding, even with multiple cuts over the past few months.\n\nMore Tesla:\nTesla investors may miss game-changing move\nJudge orders Tesla to make major change or halt sales in California\nRivian doubles down on new plan to beat Tesla\nThe selling has shown up in distinct waves:\nQ2 2025 (filed July 30): ARK disclosed 3,077,464 TSLA shares , down 181,294 from Q1.\nDec. 12, 2025: ARK sold 87,993 shares , valued at roughly $39.3 million .\nDec. 15, 2025: Another 124,867 shares were sold, worth nearly $57.3 million .\nSmaller trims on Nov. 7 (71,638 shares) and Nov. 26 (27,102 shares) reinforce the same message.\nThe biggest names inside ARK’s combined portfolio : Tesla: 10.09%\nShopify: 4.61%\nRoku, Inc.: 4.57%\nCoinbase: 4.27%\nPalantir Technologies: 3.98%\nCRISPR Therapeutics: 3.88%\nRobinhood: 3.71%\nAdvanced Micro Devices: 3.49%\nTempus: 3.41%\nTeradyne: 2.94%\nSource: Cathiesark.com\nAnalysts say Tesla’s upside is already priced in Tesla has been riding the renewed wave of optimism surrounding autonomy and AI, but a sizeable chunk of Wall Street has become a lot more valuation-sensitive.\nA lot of it is about timing and how much of the non-auto upside investors are already paying for at this point.\n\nStory Continues\nMorgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco summed that shift up perfectly, warning that most non-auto catalysts appear priced in at this point.\nRelated: Morgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nAccording to Seeking Alpha , Tesla stock trades at more than 375 times forward earnings (GAAP), which is 1,777% higher than the sector median.\n\nAdditionally, Goldman Sachs has maintained a neutral stance, keeping its price target on Tesla stock comfortably below its current price.\nBarclays also maintained an equal weight stance, signaling that the narrative alone might be tough to justify a higher multiple.\nFor perspective, Tesla closed Friday, Dec. 19, at $481.20 a share, down 0.45% on the day.\nWhere cautious targets stand:\nMorgan Stanley: Equal weight, $425\nTruist: Hold, $444 (raised from $406)\nGoldman Sachs: Neutral, $400\nBarclays: Equal weight, $350\nWells Fargo: Underweight, $120\nTesla is smaller in ARK’s portfolio, but remains central Tesla’s roughly at 10% of Wood’s combined ARK portfolio, according to Cathiesark.com , but remains an anchor. Historically, though, it has been even bigger.\nTesla’s weighting in ARK’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF ( ARKK ) reached a peak of 15.4% back in July 2024 , following a stellar run-up in value, Bloomberg reported .\n\nWood has consistently framed the business as more than “just an automaker,” saying it’s more like a platform operating at the intersection of a variety of megatrends (including robots, energy storage, and AI).\nRelated: Top-rated analyst drops curt 8-word take on Tesla stock\nOver the years, Wood has demonstrated a willingness to rebalance around sizing and choppiness in a particular stock while maintaining her long-term view.\nWood remains mighty aggressive on autonomy with Tesla stock.\nIn a Bloomberg interview cited by Business Insider , she said that Tesla’s Robotaxi business may “account for 90% of the value of the company in five years.”\nMoreover, even with rivals such as BYD pressuring EV market share , Wood remains steadfast in her defense of Tesla’s core product edge.\nRelated: Elon Musk just won back his $56 billion Tesla pay package\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 20, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.
