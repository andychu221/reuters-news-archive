Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has slammed Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk amid an AI and Robotics push.\nHow Will This Utopia Come About, Bernie Sanders Asks In a post on the social media platform X on Thursday, Sanders shared a video directed at Musk. \"Just a couple of questions for you,\" Sanders captioned the video. In the video, the Senator asked Musk questions about his artificial intelligence and robotics efforts, which will bring about a \"utopia\" in the world.\n\n\"You have told us poverty will be wiped out, work will be optional,\" Sanders said, adding that Musk also claimed that there will be \"universal high income\" for everyone. \"How will this utopia come about?\" Sanders asked if there were no \"entry-level jobs\" available in the market.\nDon't Miss:\nJeff Bezos-Backed Arrived Homes Hits A Big Sale On Charlotte Property – Investors Earning A 34.7% Return\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\"When are they going to get the free housing?\" Sanders asked, adding that if robots took over manufacturing jobs, when would the people working in factories receive free healthcare?\n\"I look forward to hearing about how you and your other oligarch friends are going to provide working people with the magnificent life that you promise,\" Sanders said.

The comments prompted Musk to call Sanders a coward who lacked \"any sense of adventure.\"\nSanders had also voiced his opposition to the construction of new data centers in the past, warning that the tech industry’s AI push posed a threat to jobs, democracy, as well as public resources.\n\nSanders has received backing from Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who said that, despite representing Silicon Valley, he was backing Sanders as he shared that the AI technology should be helpful to workers and not “tech barons.”\nTesla's $1.58 Trillion Valuation, Falling Sales Meanwhile, Tesla's total valuation recently reached $1.58 trillion, which further helped the EV giant bolster its position as the most valuable automaker in the world, putting it well ahead of other auto industry rivals, including Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM ).\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Tesla's sales continue to be lackluster, with the latest figures suggesting a steep 23% decline in November U.S. sales amid President Donald Trump ‘s introduction of several anti-EV policy changes in the U.S., like relaxing CAFE standards , among other reasons.\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: TSLA ), has seen his net worth surge to a staggering $749 billion.\nWhat Happened : The Delaware Supreme Court has reinstated Tesla stock options worth $139 billion that had previously been voided. This move also restored Musk’s 2018 compensation package, once valued at $56 billion, which a lower court had previously deemed “unfathomable.”\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the 2024 decision to rescind the pay package was both improper and unfair to Musk.\nThis ruling comes shortly after Musk became the first individual to exceed a net worth of $600 billion, following speculation that his aerospace venture, SpaceX, was set to go public.\nIn November, Tesla shareholders approved a record-breaking $1 trillion pay plan for Musk, endorsing his vision to transform the electric vehicle manufacturer into a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics.\nAlso Read: Elon Musk Says He Warned Donald Trump To Drop Tariffs Over Fears of Job Losses: ‘President Loves Tariffs, I’ve Tried To Dissuade Him’\nAccording to Forbes’ billionaires index, Musk’s wealth now surpasses that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by nearly $500 billion.\n\nWhy It Matters : The reinstatement of Musk’s stock options and compensation package by the Delaware Supreme Court marks a significant victory for the Tesla CEO.\nIt not only bolsters his financial standing but also reinforces his position at the helm of Tesla Inc.\nThe court’s decision comes at a crucial time when Musk is steering Tesla towards becoming a leader in AI and robotics, a vision that shareholders have endorsed with a $1 trillion pay plan.\nThis ruling, therefore, could have far-reaching implications for Tesla’s future direction and Musk’s ambitious plans for the company.\nRead Next\nElon Musk Tells Joe Rogan: ‘Trump Actually Is Not Perfect, but He's Not Evil'\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "As EU waters down 2035 EV goals, electric startups express concern\n\nAnna Heim\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThe future may be electric, but that future is being postponed. The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.\nInstead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate. This change is part of a broader ‘ Automotive Package ‘ designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive.\n\nIf the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors.\n“China already dominates EV manufacturing,” said Craig Douglas, a partner at World Fund, a European climate-focused venture capital firm. “If Europe doesn’t compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.”\nDouglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Senior executives from companies including Cabify, EDF, Einride, Iberdrola, and numerous EV-related startups signed the letter, exhorting the Commission to “stand firm” on the original 2035 zero-emission target.\n\nTheir appeal wasn’t enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. But continuing pressure has sparked debate within the startup community and beyond about the best path for Europe if it’s to remain competitive during the energy transition.\nIndustry split on timeline\nEven within the auto industry, opinions differ. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for many years to come.”\nUnlike Mercedes-Benz and other manufacturers, the Swedish carmaker had no concerns about meeting the 2035 ban. Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage.\n\nIssam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. “History shows that this kind of flexibility has never worked out well,” said Tidjani, who also signed the Take Charge Europe letter this fall. “It delays scale, weakens learning curves, and ultimately costs industrial leadership rather than preserving it.”\n\nStory Continues\nTo be fair, the Commission hasn’t completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security.\n\nThe plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The company, hoping to succeed where Swedish battery maker Northvolt struggled, opened its first large-scale battery factory in Northern France this week. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe’s battery industry.”\nMixed signals\nStill, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU’s commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.\nAlready, traditional carmakers have begun complaining that the carbon offset requirements could make cars more expensive for consumers, potentially undermining the very competitiveness the policy change was meant to protect.\n\nAnother uncertainty involves the United Kingdom. It’s unclear whether the U.K. will follow the EU’s lead and modify its own 2035 combustion engine ban. Unlike both the European Union and the United States, the U.K. hasn’t yet imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, despite that their rapidly increasing sales in the British market have raised concerns among domestic manufacturers.\nThe debate highlights ongoing tensions in climate policy between how to balance the economic realities facing existing industries with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner tech. As Europe tries to thread this needle, the decisions made now will invariably impact whether the continent leads or lags in the global EV market.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NYSE: UBER ) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds in 2025 . Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) received a rating update from Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt on December 19, who slashed the price target on the stock to $78 from $84 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares.\nIn addition, Bernstein analyst Nikhil Devnani reaffirmed a Buy rating on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) on December 18 and lifted the price target to $115.00 from $110.00. The analyst based the rating update on various factors, including the company’s strategic positioning in the developing autonomous vehicles landscape, growth outlook, and valuation.\n\nDevnani noted that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is trading at a discounted multiple compared to its earnings power despite competitive noise and increased headlines from peers like Tesla, Waymo, and Zoox, which points towards the market’s overreaction to near-term AV concerns.\nHe added that the long-term market is expected to paint a fragmented picture among AV players, a structure that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) can benefit from because of its platform scale and balance-sheet flexibility. This makes the recent pullback a favorable entry point for investors, according to the analyst.\nDevnani further stated that while Uber Technologies, Inc.’s (NYSE:UBER) ongoing investments in its core Mobility and Delivery operations and autonomous vehicle partnerships may constrain incremental margins temporarily, the prospect is likely to support stronger EBITDA outperformance and solid gross bookings growth over time.\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) operates as a technology platform that offers ride services and merchant delivery service providers for food, groceries, meal preparation, and other delivery services. The company’s operations are divided into Delivery, Mobility, and Freight. The Delivery segment allows users to order food, while the Mobility segment provides access to Mobility Drivers who provide rides in various vehicles. The Freight segment connects Carriers and Shippers.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Ford Motor’s announcement this past week that it was ending this generation of the money-losing F-150 Lightning (along with refocusing its EV strategy) and taking a $19.5 billion hit wasn’t just a huge blow to Chief Executive Jim Farley. Ford’s move was cheered on by those seeing it as proof that when the government cuts incentives and rules aimed at helping EVs, as the Trump administration has done, customers will vote with their wallets against green technology.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Cathie Wood buys $26.1 million of tumbling crypto stock\n\nSilin Chen\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 7:33 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ARKK\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nCathie Wood , head of Ark Investment Management, tends to trim positions after big runs and add on pullbacks, a strategy she applies not only to smaller bets but also to her top holdings.\nLast week, Wood unloaded some Tesla shares, securing $40 million in gains. She recently did some notable buying of another top holding of Ark that’s been struggling.\n\nWood gained a reputation after the Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. Year to date, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF ( ARKK ) is up 39.39% as of Dec. 19, far outpacing the S&P 500 ’s gain of 16.2% in the same period.\nWood’s style brings sweet wins in rising markets but also painful losses in bearish ones, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term results. As of Dec. 18, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -8.72%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 14.48% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar .\nCathie Wood rejects “AI bubble” Wood’s strategy is simple: her Ark ETFs focus on emerging high-tech companies in areas like artificial intelligence, blockchain , biomedical technology, and robotics.\nWood views these businesses as potential forces for big changes and long-term growth, though their volatility often brings fluctuations to the Ark’s funds.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood's net worth: The Ark Invest CEO's wealth & income\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott . That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.\nIn October, Wood said in a CNBC interview that she expects to see a market “shudder” as interest rates begin to rise.\nStill, Wood believes in the potential of AI , denying the “AI bubble” talk amid concerns about the high valuations of tech stocks.\n“I do not believe AI is in a bubble,” Wood said. “ What I do think is, on the enterprise side, it is going to take a while for large corporations to prepare themselves to transform…in order to really capitalize on the productivity gains that we think are going to be unleashed by AI.”\n\nNot all investors agree with Wood. In the 12 months through Dec. 18, the Ark Innovation ETF saw roughly $1.28 billion in net outflows, according to ETF research firm VettaFi .\nCathie Wood buys $26.1 million of Coinbase stock On Dec. 15, 17, and 18, Wood’s Ark funds bought 106,530 shares of Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ), valued at about $26.1 million.\nThe purchases extend a gradual build that began in mid-November.\nEarlier this year, Wood bought roughly 34,500 Coinbase shares during the first quarter, then sold roughly 446,000 shares and another 228,000 in the following two quarters, according to Stockcircle’s data .\n\nIn 2024, Wood unloaded a total of about 5.5 million Coinbase shares across the year, making it a full year of net selling.\nDespite those selling, Coinbase is Wood’s fourth-largest holding of the Ark Innovation ETF.\nTop 10 holdings of the Ark Innovation ETF as of Dec. 19, 2025: Tesla ( TSLA ) 12.32%\nRoku ( ROKU ) 5.89%\nCRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP ) 5.47%\nCoinbase Global (COIN) 5.28%\nShopify ( SHOP ) 5.27%\nRobinhood Markets ( HOOD ) 4.48%\nTempus AI ( TEM ) 4.44%\nPalantir Technologies ( PLTR ) 3.90%\nRoblox ( RBLX ) 3.54%\nAdvanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) 3.22%\nCoinbase runs the biggest crypto exchange in the U.S. and generates revenue through transaction fees from cryptocurrency trading on its platform.\n\nCoinbase’s stock price is closely tied to the price of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin rises, trading activity usually picks up, which helps Coinbase through higher transaction revenue and better sentiment toward crypto stocks. When it falls, trading slows and Coinbase shares could face pressure.\nYear to date, Coinbase stock is down 3%, while Bitcoin lost 5.6%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 index, which gained more than 16% over the same period.\nOn Dec. 17, Coinbase announced that it will roll out stock trading to U.S. users, allowing customers to trade stocks and ETFs alongside crypto within the same app, which reduces its reliance on crypto trading and positions it as a direct rival to brokerages such as Robinhood (HOOD).\nCantor Fitzgerald lowered its price target on Coinbase to $320 from $459 while keeping an overweight rating following the announcement, Thefly reported.\n\nThe firm said Coinbase’s update highlighted its push to become an “everything exchange,” which is strategically positive. But near-term revenue and profitability estimates are being lowered due to recent crypto sentiment declines.\nThe firm also warned that the 2026 consensus assumption for 14% trading volume growth could be overly optimistic if the market enters another crypto winter .\nOn Bitcoin, Wood says Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, which means mining rewards are cut roughly every four years, may no longer be effective, and we may have already seen the lowest point of this cycle.\n“The volatility’s going down,” she said on Fox Business on Dec. 9, adding that institutions “are going to prevent much more of a decline” and that “we may have seen the low a couple of weeks ago.”\nWood also argues that the market’s behavior has shifted, as Bitcoin trades more like a risk-on asset, moving in line with equities and real estate rather than acting as a hedge.\n“Now, gold is more of a risk-off asset,” she said.\nRelated: Cathie Wood sells $40 million of megacap tech stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO, Elon Musk , weighed in on a post praising Google-parent Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) new hardware play, and the company’s reemergence as the dominant player in the ongoing AI race.\nLong-Time Google Critic Turns Investor On Thursday, in a post on X, serial AI entrepreneur and digital nomad Pieter Levels , who goes by the name Levelsio , announced that he had purchased over $1 million in Alphabet shares, after being “the biggest Google hater for years.”\nLevels said the company had been “completely mismanaged” for years and was “destroyed by politics and lack of any leadership,” before undergoing a turnaround that he attributed to the return of co-founder Sergey Brin , whom he described as the “de facto CEO.”\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nAccording to Levels, Google is now “dominating not just in the AI benchmarks and leaderboards but in real usage,” while pointing out that “AI benchmarks can, and are easily rigged.”\nHe pointed to Google's proprietary tensor processing units, massive data advantages through YouTube, Google Images and web search, and what he described as renewed engineering leadership under Brin for his investment decision, and why he thinks the company is now set to lead the AI race.\n“It’s really just Google and Elon Musk and the Chinese in the end who will probably win,” Levels said, adding that he only relies on models from Google, Musk’s xAI, and Chinese firms such as ByteDance , Kling and Minimax .\nLevels, the founder of PhotoAI, InteriorAI and RemoteOK, also said that he had trimmed his holdings in NVIDIA Corp.

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Be Worth More Than $2 Trillion by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Tesla is operating in a difficult environment.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are providing computing units for the AI build-out.\nMeta Platforms' stock was slammed due to spending plans.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nThere are currently five stocks that have a valuation of $2 trillion or more. Outside of these five, only a handful of others are in a position to be worth $2 trillion or more in 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nThe next largest company is Berkshire Hathaway , which has a market cap of about $1 trillion. For that stock to double would be a huge feat, especially without Warren Buffett at the helm, so let's put it aside.\nNow we're left with Meta, Tesla, Broadcom, and TSMC. Which of these will make it to $2 trillion by the end of 2026?\nAll will beat the market if they reach $2 trillion by 2026 The largest is Meta Platforms, sitting at a $1.66 trillion valuation. The smallest is Taiwan Semiconductor at $1.49 billion. That places all four of these stocks in relatively close proximity to each other, which means the required return is fairly similar. Meta would need to rise 21% while Taiwan Semiconductor must rise 34%. Both of these potential performance figures would indicate a market-beating stock, so if any of these companies can breach the $2 trillion threshold, they will likely be great to own.\nThe $2 trillion threshold is also uncharted territory for this group. Both Meta and Broadcom have come close, but neither has crossed into the $2 trillion zone.\nI think three will make it, while one will be left out If you sort the companies by growth rates, it's clear that there's one outlier: Tesla.\nIt's no secret that Tesla is struggling in the current environment, due to electric vehicle (EV) credits ending from the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the other three are posting incredible growth rates that don't look to be slowing down anytime soon in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips in the artificial intelligence supply chain. Without its production capabilities, none of the AI computing power we know now would be possible. Demand for AI chips isn't slowing down, and Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to continue growing at a rapid 21% pace in 2026, according to Wall Street analysts. However, these analysts have consistently underestimated Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the past few years, so don't be surprised if TSMC outperforms these expectations. Couple that with the second-cheapest valuation in this group, and Taiwan Semiconductor should reach the $2 trillion mark in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms nearly entered the $2 trillion club, but pulled back following a poorly received third-quarter earnings report. While the business's performance was incredible, investors didn't like Meta's massive spending plans. There is growing concern that Meta is overextending itself, which is why investors have started selling off the stock. However, I think Meta is just the first company to max out its cash flows being devoted to AI computing capacity, and it won't be the last. The market will come back around to Meta's stock in 2026 and will send it back to levels allowing it to reach the $2 trillion point.\n\nLast is Broadcom, which also sold off due to 2026 guidance. Wall Street wanted greater visibility into faster AI growth, and Broadcom told investors they needed to be patient. Still, Broadcom informed investors that its Q4 AI revenue was $6.5 billion, up 74% year over year, and that it projects Q1's growth to be north of 100%. Broadcom is a much larger business than just AI, and the business isn't nearly as successful in those endeavors. Still, I think sustained growth from its custom AI computing units will drive Broadcom's stock higher in 2026, allowing it to reach the $2 trillion threshold.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil. Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done. It's so terrible, you can't believe it,\" Elon Musk said about his father.\nIn 1998, Errol admitted to killing three people, asserting it was in self-defense. He was subsequently arrested, but the charges were later dropped.\nAlso Read: Elon Musk’s Father Says America Will Collapse if White Population Becomes Minority: ‘You Want To See the US Go Down?’\nElon Musk has repeatedly stated that his father’s words cannot be trusted, further emphasizing the tense relationship between the two.\n\n\"In my experience, there is nothing you can do. \"Nothing, nothing. I wish. I've tried everything. I tried threats, rewards, intellectual arguments, emotional arguments, everything to try to change my father for the better, and he, no way, it just got worse,\" Elon Musk added.\nThe strained relationship between Elon Musk and his father, Errol, has been a topic of public interest for years.\nThe recent revelations about Errol’s controversial life provide a deeper understanding of the familial dynamics and the potential impact it may have on Elon Musk, one of the most influential tech entrepreneurs of our time.\nRead Next\nMusk's Father Says He Warned His Son Against Going Into Politics – ‘He's Not a Very Good Politician At All'\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ), Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN ), and Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: SLMT ).\nThe Tesla Trade Ark Invest executed a notable transaction by selling 23,110 shares of Tesla through its ARK Innovation ETF (BATS: ARKK ). The sale, valued at approximately $11.2 million, comes amid a backdrop of Tesla’s stock pulling back after reaching all-time highs earlier in the week.\nTesla’s shares have been experiencing volatility, with investors closely watching the company’s autonomous driving advancements.\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nHave $100k+ to invest?

This movement reflects ongoing market interest, even as Ark adjusts its holdings in the electric vehicle giant.\nThe Coinbase Trade Ark Invest also made a strategic purchase of Coinbase shares across its ARK Blockchain & Fintech Innovation ETF (BATS: ARKF ), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (BATS: ARKW ) and ARKK . The combined acquisition of 17,386 shares is valued at approximately $4.15 million. This move aligns with Coinbase’s recent announcement of launching traditional stock trading, as detailed in a Benzinga article .\n\nCoinbase announced it would launch commission-free U.S. stock trading with 24-hour access five days a week, expanding beyond its crypto-only roots. The company positioned the move as a step toward becoming a single platform for both digital assets and traditional equities, while laying groundwork for future tokenized stocks. Management said regulatory constraints required starting with conventional stock trading before pursuing blockchain-based equities. The expansion aimed to diversify revenue and reduce dependence on volatile crypto trading cycles.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThe Brera Holdings Trade Ark Invest significantly increased its stake in Brera Holdings by purchasing a total of 575,644 shares through its ARKW , ARKF and ARKK ETFs.

He then took a sarcastic jibe at the Cybercab for having a steering wheel and pedals and \"being driven manually by a human being!\"\nIt's worth noting that the Cybercab shown in the video by O'Dowd has California registration plates and was first seen after a video was posted on X late last month.

      "Content": "What’s next for EVs after a year of unraveling\n\nHamza Shaban · Senior Reporter\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: F\n\nRIVN\n\nGM\n\nTOYOF\n\nGOOG\n\nThis is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nOne major thing changed the game for the American EV market this year: the elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit .\n\nIn an instant, EVs became much more expensive, and a key incentive for consumers and automakers to accelerate the EV transition vanished.\nIn the place of an electrified future, pushed further away, a more incremental, hybrid present is taking shape.\nEven before the EV policy shift, consumer demand had waned. Concerns lingered over the turn away from gas-powered cars. Higher costs were a factor , but so was unresolved anxiety over a perceived scarcity of charging stations and battery range. And a strain of American machismo — think of the most over-the-top Super Bowl ad aesthetic — continues to reject the technology as something prissy and foreign.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nAutomakers have struggled with the EV transition , and ambitious, revamped lineups have been curtailed.\nThe latest sign came earlier this month , when Ford announced it would abandon plans for several EV models and instead pivot to hybrid and extended-range vehicles. Ford said it would take $19.5 billion in charges related to the EV revamp.\n\nThe European Union is also expected to advance a measure to delay its 2035 ban on sales of internal combustion cars, ceding to national governments and automakers who have pushed for more flexibility .\nThat automakers have pulled back on their EV ambitions marks a major detour for the industry.\nBut the rough going offers clues of what 2026 and the next phase of the EV roadmap will look like: A focus on hybrids, lower cost models, and pressure from international markets will help shape the market.\nFord, for instance, is ending production of its Lightning, the EV variant of the F-150 pickup truck. Taking its place will be a compromise, an extended-range version that uses a gas engine as a generator.\nCrucially, the carmaker is sticking with plans to release a low-cost EV pickup by 2027. That's a sign that carmakers believe affordability and product fit can still make EVs work... just not yet.\nToyota, which was until recently seen as late to the EV space, has embraced the hybrid lineup (where it was first mover with the Prius) as a kind of stepping stone, positioning itself within the sweet spot of consumer preference — eager for better gas mileage, but not quite ready for an EV.\nPolicy changes and competition from low-cost Chinese models do complicate things for the US market. What is considered a broad retreat from pure EVs in America could expose automakers here to the eventual adoption of Chinese and European EVs — which will have the advantage of years of development and consumer feedback.\n\nStory Continues\nIn some ways, the market energy that was once buzzing around EVs has migrated to another transportation disruptor: robotaxis.\nElon Musk's Tesla ( TSLA ) is slated to begin production of its autonomous Cybercab next year, in what its most bullish backers say could add another trillion dollars to its market cap.\n\nAlphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Waymo, seeking to raise money at a valuation of at least $100 billion , has thousands of commercial robotaxis operating in the US. And Uber, through more than a dozen partnerships , has plans to provide robotaxis in at least 10 markets by the end of next year.\nThis isn't exactly the all-electric future that its most bullish proponents had envisioned. But in 2026, a hybrid approach is the recalibration the industry is banking on.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

      "Content": "Tesla’s deliveries set to undershoot in Q4, Deutsche Bank says\n\nSenad Karaahmetovic\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:37 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nInvesting.com -- Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu expects Tesla’s fourth-quarter 2025 vehicle deliveries to come in below both consensus expectations and the bank’s prior forecast, driven by weaker volumes in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, China, even as optimism around robotaxi development continues to support a bullish longer-term view.\n\nYu forecasts fourth-quarter deliveries of about 405,000 vehicles, which would imply a 14% decline from a year earlier and a 19% drop from the prior quarter. He said the shortfall is largely concentrated in Tesla’s core Western markets, with Europe and North America expected to see delivery declines of 34% and 33%, respectively.\n.\nChina volumes are also projected to fall, though by a smaller margin. Yu expects deliveries in China to be down by roughly 10%. Registration data through November tracked close to 100,000 units, compared with Deutsche Bank’s estimate of 178,000 deliveries for the full quarter.\nYu noted that December has historically been Tesla’s strongest month in China and expects a similar pattern this year, particularly as a higher NEV consumption tax in 2026 could encourage a pull-forward of demand.\n\nThe rest of the world stands out as a relative bright spot. Deutsche Bank expects deliveries outside Tesla’s major regions to grow more than 60% year over year, partially offsetting weakness elsewhere.\nLower volumes are also expected to weigh on profitability. Yu forecasts automotive gross margin excluding credits to decline sequentially to 14.4%, down 100 basis points from the third quarter, primarily due to weaker fixed-cost absorption tied to lower production and deliveries.\nLooking beyond the quarter, Yu believes full-year delivery expectations remain too high. While consensus is centered around 1.66 million vehicles for 2025, Deutsche Bank models 1.62 million units, implying a 9% year-over-year decline based on its fourth-quarter assumptions.\n\nDespite near-term delivery and margin pressure, Yu said the robotaxi narrative remains a key support for Tesla’s valuation. Elon Musk has previously suggested a fleet of about 1,000 robotaxis in the Bay Area and more than 500 in Austin, though Deutsche Bank’s tracking indicates those levels are unlikely to be achieved in the near term.\nStill, Tesla recently removed the safety driver in Austin for internal validation testing, which Yu views as a sign that a broader rollout could be approaching.\nDeutsche Bank raised its price target on Buy-rated Tesla stock by $30 to $500, reflecting higher valuation multiples for robotaxi and humanoid initiatives, partially offset by lower assumptions for the core automotive business.\n\nStory Continues\nRelated articles\nTesla’s deliveries set to undershoot in Q4, Deutsche Bank says\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) ranks among the best high growth stocks to buy now . On November 25, Mizuho maintained its Outperform rating on Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) but lowered its price target from $48 to $475. Mizuho made the adjustment in anticipation of possible obstacles for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in 2026, notably pointing to anticipated cuts in subsidies in major markets.\nAsif Islam / Shutterstock.com\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stated that it delivered 497,000 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, up 7% from 463,000 the year before. The company also announced previously in October that sales of large batteries had increased by more than 80%. Tesla’s storage batteries have grown in prominence as utilities add them to the electric grid to even out the oscillations of wind and solar power.\n\nHowever, given fears regarding subsidy cuts, Mizuho has reduced Tesla’s production forecasts to 1.75 million vehicles in 2026 and 2 million in 2027, which is somewhat lower than consensus expectations of 1.82 million and 2.15 million.\nThat said, despite short-term obstacles, Mizuho identified a number of potential future drivers for Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), such as the adoption of FSD v14 for autonomous driving and robotaxi launches, which it believes would strengthen the company until 2027.\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells EVs, and energy generation & storage systems in the US, China, and internationally.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Prediction: Tesla's Joyride Will Come to a Screeching Halt in 2026 (Spoiler Alert: Elon Broke Another Promise)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Elon Musk recently confirmed that robotaxi testing, without occupants, is underway.\nInvestors are excited about the robotaxi and Tesla's artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions.\nMusk has a history of missing deadlines, including the robotaxi launch.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nThere may be no other company with a future that hinges more on artificial intelligence (AI) than Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) . As it stands today, Tesla's core revenue streams come from electric vehicles (EV) and solar energy equipment.\nFor years, however, the company's eccentric CEO Elon Musk has been promising to revolutionize the business through AI. Specifically, Tesla is seeking to build a fleet of fully autonomous vehicles in an effort to upend the mobility market.\nAs of this writing (Dec. 16), Tesla stock is hovering near all-time highs . The reason? Musk recently provided a well-received update on the company's robotaxi efforts.\nWhile this is exciting news, my bold prediction for 2026 is that Tesla's joyride may come to a screeching halt. Read on to find out why.\n\nTesla has a history is misleading investors While Tesla has achieved a number of remarkable feats throughout its history, the company isn't known for staying the course with deadlines.\nThe list below is a summary of missed deadlines and overzealous promises made by Musk over the last several years:\n2017: Musk said that a Tesla would be able to drive across the country, from Los Angeles to New York, fully autonomously. Nearly a decade later, this has never happened.\n2017: Tesla unveiled its plan for a semi truck back in 2017. Initially, production schedules for the Tesla Semi were set for 2019. In reality, the company delayed its initial production until 2022. Moreover, Tesla Semi remains in pilot mode, and mass production hasn't yet occurred.\n2017: Nearly 10 years ago, Tesla unveiled the idea of a next-generation vehicle, dubbed the Roadster 2.0. The original target date for initial production was 2020, but as of now, the car hasn't been released.\n2019: Back in 2019, Musk predicted that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Midway through this decade, robotaxi has not yet launched in a commercial sense. Its usage remains limited in Austin, Texas as further testing and regulatory approvals are needed.\n2019: After unveiling the Cybertruck in 2019, Tesla targeted initial production timelines for 2021. A series of delays plagued the Cybertruck launch, which didn't materialize until late 2023.\n2020-2024: Over the last several years, Musk has suggested on numerous occasions that the company's full self-driving (FSD) technology would be complete. While FSD has made some meaningful improvements, it remains a work in a progress.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile the timeline above serves as nice summary of Tesla's misleading statements, what does any of this have to do with robotaxi?\n2026 might not be any different During Tesla's second-quarter earnings call in July, Musk said:\nOver the summer, Tesla launched robotaxi in Austin, Texas and the San Francisco Bay area. However, there was a major catch. The ride-hailing service was fairly limited in its launch, and the cars featured human safety drivers as a precaution.\nJust days ago, Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) that further testing in robotaxi was ongoing without any occupants in the cars. Naturally, the Tesla investor base cheered and the stock popped.\n\nHere's the reality: Musk implied that the robotaxi would be serving a multitude of major markets in the U.S. by the end of the year. It's mid-December now, and robotaxi hasn't launched as a commercial service. While regulatory processes can be arduous, I'm suspicious if that's the sole reason the robotaxi hasn't met Musk's prior timeline goal.\nIs Tesla stock a buy before 2026? As of this writing, Tesla boasts a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 17.6 and a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of nearly 320. For context, a P/S at this level is abnormally high for an automobile business. Likewise, Tesla's P/E multiple is unsustainable -- regardless of its core industry.\nThroughout 2025, Tesla's valuation has expanded significantly. All the while, the company's EV business -- it's largest driver of sales and profit -- is in major decline and showing no signs of improvement. Moreover, robotaxi still hasn't launched or become a meaningful financial contributor for the business.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, I think Tesla stock is largely influenced by narratives, hope, and hype, as opposed to the actual underlying performance of the business and where its AI ambitions truly stand. For these reasons, I'd hold off investing in Tesla stock in 2026 unless the company proves considerable traction in the robotaxi effort.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "5 predictions for tech and AI in 2026 from mega-bull Dan Ives\n\nSamuel O'Brient\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:11 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nDan Ives, one of Wall Street's biggest tech bulls, released his predictions for 2026.\nHe thinks the AI revolution is just starting, and that investors shouldn't be spooked by bubble talk.\nIves sees big things coming from Tesla , Google, and Apple next year.\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities unveiled his list of top predictions for the tech sector for 2026, and the outspoken tech bull isn't any less optimistic about what the new year holds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he sees big things ahead for Tesla. Shares of Elon Musk's car company hit a record high this week, but Ives predicts even more gains to come.\nMore broadly, the analyst sees the AI story continuing to unfold in 2026, and urges investors to buckle in for another bullish year in the space.\n\"On one hand this is a 4th Industrial Revolution taking shape with the US leading China on tech for the first in 30 years...while on the other hand the trillions of dollars needed to reach the heights of enterprise/consumer AI Revolution have caused nervousness and doubters among investors,\" Ives said in a note on Friday.\nHere are Ives' biggest predictions for tech and AI in 2026.\nTesla rolls out robotaxis in 30 cities\nIves is as bullish as ever on Tesla and believes that the EV leader will expand its robotaxi reach in 2026.\n\"Tesla will successfully launch Robotaxis in over 30 cities in 2026 and start to scale volume production of Cybercabs,\" Ives predicts.\nThe EV maker still has its bears. Ross Gerber told Business Insider recently that he doesn't think Tesla can catch up in the self-driving car race as Waymo advances rapidly, but Ives remains steadfast in his conviction that Musk's company will win the driverless race.\nHe sees Tesla stock rising 26% in his base case and as much as 68% in his bull case.\nOracle advances in the AI data center market\nOracle has struggled recently after a lackluster earnings report that raised some questions about the strength of the AI trade. However, Ives isn't worried about the concern that the company is overspending on AI . He predicts a turnaround is coming for Oracle stock in 2026.\n\"Oracle successfully builds out its datacenter targets, starts to convert its massive RPO AI backlog and hits $250 per share in 2026 despite the dark negative sentiment on the stock today,\" he predicted.\nApple and Google will team up on AI\nTwo of the biggest names in tech are likely to team up in 2026 to help usher in the next phase of AI, according to Ives. He predicts that a joint venture between Apple and Google is coming, one that will help the iPhone maker catch up to competitors in the AI race.\n\nStory Continues\n\"Apple and Google will announce a formal AI partnership around Gemini that will finally cement a real AI strategy for Cupertino,\" Ives said. \"This will ultimately be a subscription service launched in the Apple network and lead to Apple achieving a $5 trillion market cap in 2026.\"\nNebius to be acquired\nAI infrastructure provider Nebius may be one of the next big winners of the AI arms race. The Dutch company is Ives' top pick to be acquired by a Big Tech hyperscaler in 2026. He named Microsoft , Alphabet and Amazon as likely candidates to swoop in and buy it.\nNebius stock is coming off an extremely strong 2025, with 212% year-to-date gains. Ives isn't the only pro who sees it as a likely winner. Market research firm Futurum Group named it among its picks for the top tech stocks for the next generation of AI.\nCybersecurity stocks will surge\nIves is also highly bullish on the cybersecurity industry, touting it as one of the tech market's highest performing subsectors. He named CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks as Wedbush's top picks in the space for the coming year.\nWhile Palo Alto Networks has struggled recently and is only up 2% year-to-date, CrowdStrike has spent the year trending upward with 41% gains. Cybersecurity industry experts have also flagged both stocks as likely winners set to capitalize on rising security demand.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk recovers $55 billion pay package in Delaware court ruling\n\nMICHAEL LIEDTKE\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:47 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nElon Musk, already the world's richest man, scored another huge windfall Friday when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018 as an incentive for its CEO to steer the automaker to new heights.\nBesides padding Musk's current fortune of $679 billion, the restoration of the 2018 pay package vindicates his long-held belief that the Delaware legal system had overstepped its bounds in January 2024 when Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick rescinded the compensation in a case brought by a disgruntled Tesla shareholder.\n\nTesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.\nMcCormick's ruling so incensed Musk that it spurred him to spurn Delaware and reincorporate Tesla in Texas . That decision also caused Tesla's board to scramble for ways to keep its CEO happy, including a successful effort to persuade the company's shareholders to reaffirm the pay package, which was valued at $44.9 billion at the time of the second vote 18 months ago .\nWith Musk still signaling discontent, Tesla upped the ante again this year by crafting another pay package that could pay him $1 trillion if he can lead the automaker down a road during the next decade that lifts the company's market value from its current $1.6 trillion to $8.5 trillion. Shareholders approved that pay package last month, to Musk's delight.\n\nThat may sound like a difficult task, but it also appeared like a long shot for Musk to hit all the targets to qualify for the payout that was dangled in the 2018 package. At that time, Tesla was still struggling to expand its production of electric vehicles and burning through cash.\nAt the time the 2018 pay package was drawn up, Tesla's market value was hovering in the $50 billion to $75 billion range. But then the company's manufacturing problems eased, enabling it to start meeting hot demand for its vehicles, which in turn pumped up its sales and stock price to a level that qualified Musk for the big payout that had been promised him.\nBut based on evidence that included Musk's testimony during a 2022 trial, McCormick ruled the pay package had been crafted by a board that was too cozy and beholden to the hard-charging Musk.\nIn its 49-page ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court cited a variety of errors in McCormick's 2024 decision and declared the 2018 pay package should be restored. It also awarded Tesla $1 in nominal damages.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversaw the bench, had found that even though Tesla shareholders twice approved the compensation plan, the size of the package was unfair to shareholders .\n\nShe wrote that the Tesla board “bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.”\nEven after shareholders voted again in favor of the package, McCormick rejected the package as unfair a second time.\nBut the Delaware Supreme Court ruled Friday that the lower court erred in its opinion and that tossing out the 2018 pay package was “inequitable” and that doing so “leaves Musk uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years.”\nMusk is already the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $644 billion, according to Bloomberg’s billionaire tracker.

Tesla’s stock is near the record high it reached earlier this week.\n\nHe was recently awarded a new pay package by Tesla that could be worth $1 trillion if the value of Tesla stock climbs as much as he and the company project.\nAnd Tesla is only part of Musk’s net worth.

      "Content": "Elon Musk’s massive 2018 Tesla pay package restored by Delaware court\n\nMaddy Lauria\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:52 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nElon Musk ’s controversial $56bn pay package from Tesla was reinstated by the Delaware supreme court on Friday, two years after a lower court struck down the vast compensation deal as “unfathomable”.\nThe reinstated pay package could be worth as much as $139bn today, according to the New York Times . The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn .\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\nRelated: Elon Musk’s net worth hits estimated $600bn as SpaceX prepares for IPO\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or for more details on Friday’s ruling.\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him , had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\nRelated: US Senate confirms billionaire Musk ally Jared Isaacman as Nasa chief\n\nStory Continues\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Elon Musk’s $56B Tesla pay package restored by Delaware Supreme Court\n\nSean O'Kane\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has reinstated Elon Musk’s $56 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, overturning last year’s ruling by the state’s Chancery Court, according to an opinion published Friday.\nThe state supreme court’s decision draws to a close a years-long battle that left such a bad taste in Musk’s mouth that he moved its incorporation out of Delaware to Texas, which prompted other companies to follow suit.\n\nTesla will now likely revoke a $29 billion pay package it offered Musk earlier this year, which was meant as a hedge against the possibility that they would lose the Delaware Supreme Court appeal. The $1 trillion compensation package awarded to Musk in November is separate from that, and will continue to exist going forward, giving Musk a series of lofty goals to hit in order to unlock the full value.\nThe 2018 award also set out a number of milestones that Musk had to hit in order to unlock the full value. Musk and Tesla hit all of those goals, but not before a shareholder filed suit over the award in 2018, arguing that it had been improperly negotiated and that shareholders weren’t properly informed of the conflicts of interest at play.\nAfter years of back-and-forth, including a trial where Musk testified, the Chancery Court judge overseeing the case agreed with the plaintiff and initially struck down the pay package in January 2024 . Tesla held a vote at its annual meeting in 2024 where shareholders “re-approved” the package, but the judge confirmed her decision in December 2024. Tesla appealed soon after.\nThis story is developing…\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

We're digging into all of this in today's options pit, sponsored by Tasty trade.\n00:15 Speaker A\nAnd Henry Schwartz, CBOE Vice President of Market Intelligence is here to discuss. Uh, let's talk about this surge in options demand. We were just talking offline. You said it's up what three times since uh COVID?\n00:32 Henry Schwartz\nYeah.\n00:33 Speaker A\nThat is incredible. So, what is this trend tell you?\n00:36 Henry Schwartz\nSo, I mean, this year we're going to see 15 billion option contracts trade. Uh if you go back to to just before COVID, it was about 4 billion contracts a year. So, and in fact, I've been doing the calculations. It looks like the 15 billionth contract will trade on Christmas Eve.\n00:52 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:52 Henry Schwartz\nI think we should have a door prize or something. Let's see if we can figure out what trade.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThere might be some binary option futures betting markets that could uh take care of that.\n01:00 Henry Schwartz\nAbsolutely. Well, I mean, that that's actually kind of one of the big themes, right? As we've seen this the evolution of risk taking, betting, you know, there's a lot of different ways to discuss it. Um, you know, the the you know, COVID really or you know, that whole kind of market environment really changed the landscape for options trading. And basically, uh we saw growth of about 50% in 2020 and it has kept up and it is retail that is really driving most of that. You know, we continue to see, you know, a healthy institutional business. Uh we see, you know, we see, you know, the the big theme really for this year is kind of everything is just stronger. Across the board, no matter what asset classes you look at, if you're talking about index options like SPX or VIX. If you're talking about ETF options, which you know, we were just talking about kind of the explosion in in number of ETFs and single stock option flow, which is really, you know, primarily retail driven. And when you have a year like, you know, like we're seeing this year with, you know, basically the broad averages up, you know, between 15 and 20%, uh that just brings in more and more activity.\n02:08 Speaker A\nSo, I've been thinking about this and tell me if I'm just way offline here. But if we take it back to early late 2020, early 2021, that's when we had the whole Reddit GameStop phenomenon going on. Arguably, a lot of it was fueled with the stimulus checks, the stimmies. and next year is going to be a blockbuster record year for fiscal stimulus. Um there's going to be a lot of tax refunds and I'm just wondering, is there any way we could have some kind of a repeat of that, maybe not to the same extent, but do you think that we just get another surge, um perhaps just because people have more money to play with?\n02:46 Henry Schwartz\nI I mean, I think you have you have a lot of dynamics going on at the same time. You know, we do have a a a rate, you know, the rates are going down in the cycle, but you also do have some concerns about the labor market, you have concerns about, you know, just fundamental valuations. So there's a little bit of push and pull. I think, you know, that the the COVID situation and you know, zero interest rates and stimulus and meme stock, uh that that was such a perfect storm of just kind of\n03:28 Speaker A\nAgreed, perfect storm.\n03:29 Henry Schwartz\nexplosive bullish activity and and and retail were able to capitalize on it. You know, in a large part because they were at home and they kind of had the freedom to trade. You also had commissions that basically gone to zero just leading into that. So, everything came together and you know, a lot of these traders found each other and learned from each other on Reddit and on, you know, social media. Uh I don't know if 2026 is going to be quite the same. I think there's a little bit more kind of back and forth. Uh but you know, at least in terms of the options activity, you know, we continue to see new brokerage firms coming uh online. We see the existing brokerage firms, you know, innovating and and rolling out new platforms and doing some really interesting things. So, you know, I see the business, at least in the options world continuing to to do very, very well. And you know, in terms of assets, uh you know, I think that you have this environment now where, you know, the US has had an amazing run and there's a lot of people that say, oh, you know, I don't know, this is getting a little bit tired. Uh but at the same time, you you you know, every time we have a dip, uh,\n04:36 Speaker A\nAnd that's arguably better for options traders. I mean, option traders like volatility. I I I want to make sure we get to a couple other things here. The other is the rise of zero-dated options. And so that just gives more opportunities. Back in the day, you only had monthlies, so you had to wait every month. Then we had weeklies, then basically we have dailies now. And that has just increased uh this volume of options. Talk to me about some of the other innovations. I know CBOE has a bunch of new products, too.\n05:08 Henry Schwartz\nYeah, so the so we pioneered the zero DTE or the daily option option cycle starting 2022 and those are now about 2/3 of the activity uh in SPX and um and some of the big ETFs. Uh and there there's no signs of that slowing down. Uh we just rolled out the Mag 10 index, which is the Mag 7 plus uh Broadcom, uh AMD and Palantir. And you know, those 10 symbols together do about a third of the single stock option. Out of almost 4,000 single stocks. So you you can see how concentrated it is. That's what the trader, that's what the investing public really, really is interested in. They're following the stories, they're getting in and getting out of these stocks. And so the Mag 10 index which launched about a month ago, I'm very proud to say I was the very first trade in in Mag 10. and that option expired today and I made a little bit of money at it. Uh we actually have daily options coming in those just uh in two weeks. So that's, you know, and that's new, right? This this is the first time that that there's been a uh an index that's not quite as broad-based with the daily options on it as well. So, um you know, there's you know, the the industry just continues to keep innovating. You know, we see a lot of work going on in complex order execution, which is you know, basically about a third of the activity is customers trading one option against another, vertical spreads, calendar spreads, exactly. Uh and that you know, CBOE and all the other exchanges continue to kind of take steps to make that uh easier to do, add functionality. You can now trade flex options versus listed options, which is a kind of a special option that lets people pick their own expiration date and um and strike price and even exercise style.\n06:56 Speaker A\nAll right, Henry, we got to leave it there, but congratulations on your Mag 10 trade. I hope it pretends a bullish 2026. Thanks for joining us in studio here.\n07:05 Henry Schwartz\nAwesome.\n07:06 Speaker A\nAll right, we'll\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

A stake of that size would be worth around $30 billion and Musk is the only ‌individual with that much stock.\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware, and Jan Wolfe in Washington; Additional reporting by Chris ‌Kirkham in Los AngelesEditing by Rod Nickel, Alexia Garamfalvi and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The SPIE Megapack deal reinforces the energy pillar, but the key near term catalyst remains progress and approvals on robotaxis, while regulatory pushback on self driving in places like California is the most immediate risk to that narrative.\n\nThe SPIE framework agreement matters because it ties Tesla’s Megapacks more closely to Europe’s grids just as analysts argue that energy could rival or exceed the auto segment in value. That connection makes the energy business an increasingly important offset to softer EV demand and the uncertainty around how quickly regulators will allow Tesla to scale paid autonomy services.\nYet investors also need to consider how fast regulators in the US and Europe actually sign off on Tesla’s self driving ambitions before assuming that...\nRead the full narrative on Tesla (it's free!)\nTesla's narrative projects $148.1 billion revenue and $15.4 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Tesla's forecasts yield a $391.35 fair value , a 19% downside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives 215 fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$70 to over US$2,700 per share, showing just how far opinions can diverge.

      "Content": "Morgan Stanley seen as front-runner for SpaceX IPO, sources say\n\nEcho Wang, Joey Roulette and Milana Vinn\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:43 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nXAAI.PVT\n\nBy Echo Wang, Joey Roulette and Milana Vinn\nNEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is emerging as a leading contender for a key role in SpaceX's blockbuster initial public offering, as the bank's close ties to CEO Elon Musk give it an edge in his decision, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nA selection process, ​or \"bake-off,\" for the IPO is still underway, with a select group of banks, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, vying for roles, four people familiar with the matter said, ‌adding that there is no certainty Morgan Stanley will secure the coveted \"lead left\" underwriting position, the sources said.\nMusk's ties to Morgan Stanley run deep, dating back at least 15 years, leaving it widely viewed as the leading contender to run the syndicate ‌of underwriters, three of the people said, though no banks have been selected yet and the discussions remain fluid.\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment, while SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSpaceX is one of the world’s largest private companies and its potential IPO would be highly complex.\nWhile Musk has not yet picked the lead banks, a decision could come before the end of the year, with the full syndicate likely to be finalized afterward, two of the people added.\nThe people cautioned that while plans are progressing, the IPO ⁠remains contingent on market conditions, and SpaceX could choose to delay ‌or abandon the offering altogether.\nLINKS TO TESLA 'S IPO\nMorgan Stanley, which has advised Musk for years, was among the banks that took Tesla public in 2010, alongside Goldman Sachs, the lead left, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank. Morgan Stanley later advised Musk and led the financing for his 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now X.\nMusk ‍recently tapped one of his Morgan Stanley bankers on that deal, Anthony Armstrong, to become chief financial officer of his artificial intelligence venture xAI.\n\nThe connection runs even deeper through Musk’s family office in Austin, Texas. Another former Morgan Stanley banker who advised Musk on various Wall Street dealings over the years, Jared Birchall, built and runs Excession, which manages his personal assets, Reuters previously reported.\nSTAFF MEMO\nIn a staff memo sent last week, SpaceX Chief Financial ​Officer Bret Johnsen informed staff that the company was preparing for a public offering in 2026.\n\"Whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain, but the ‌thinking is that if we execute brilliantly and the markets cooperate, a public offering could raise a significant amount of capital,\" Johnsen wrote.\n\nStory Continues\nReuters has previously reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise more than $25 billion in an IPO that could come next year, a sum that would make it one of the biggest public listings ever globally.\nThe decision to go public caught some by surprise, given SpaceX's status as one of the world's largest private companies.\n\nWhile Musk has long expressed a preference for keeping SpaceX private, people familiar with his thinking indicated that the company’s growing valuation and the success of its Starlink satellite-internet service have prompted a shift in strategy.\nSpaceX, long known for its dominant rocket launch business, has become the world's largest satellite operator through Starlink, a network of nearly 10,000 satellites beaming ⁠broadband internet to consumers, governments and enterprise customers.\nWhile there had been previous speculation about Starlink going public on ​its own, these people say the IPO could include both businesses, though the plans remain subject to change.\nAI FUELS NEED ​FOR CAPITAL\nSpaceX, Johnsen wrote in his email, would use the capital raised from an IPO to increase the flight rate of its next-generation Starship rocket under development and deploy AI data centers in space, an effort complementary to its Starlink business that would more closely tie the company to the AI boom.\n\nThe company would ‍also build \"Moonbase Alpha,\" a base on the lunar surface ⁠that Musk has mentioned. SpaceX is a core contractor in NASA's Artemis moon program with a $4 billion contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface using Starship.\nSending humans and robots to Mars has been Musk's long-held vision for SpaceX, with revenues from Starlink contributing to development of Starship, which is also envisioned to serve as a Mars transportation system.\nMusk, during ⁠his stint as a government efficiency czar with U.S. President Donald Trump, had pushed for a greater American focus on Mars and advocated for a former associate, Jared Isaacman, to lead NASA. Isaacman became NASA chief on Tuesday.\nStarlink remains SpaceX's ‌top revenue-generating business. The company is expanding the satellite network into the wireless market with Starlink Mobile, which it trademarked in October.\n(Reporting by Echo Wang and Milana Vinn ‌in New York and Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Dawn Kopecki, Jamie Freed and Nick Zieminski)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Earlier this week, Ford announced major pivots toward hybrid vehicles for 2026 while cutting its F-150 Lightning electric pickup line.\nYahoo Finance senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian outlines the performance of each automaker's EV segments.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n2025 marked a turning point for the auto industry with the big three auto makers, Ford, GM and Stelantis all backing away from their lofty electric vehicle ambitions. Senior Auto reporter Pras is here now with a closer look at the pivot. So let's take them one by one. And let's take forward first, which just gave us more information recently about their pivot.\n00:20 Pras Subramanian\nRight, right. and you know, we assumed things would be changing at the end of 2023, uh change a new administration. So there was a preview of things to come and Ford basically a year later now sort of in revealed their big pivot. A 19.5 billion dollar charge to the EV business. I mean that's a huge number. one of the biggest that I I think we've ever seen from a a write down from both the cash and special items charges there. So but basically what they're going to do they're going to convert to more hybrids, build more gas-powered cars, fewer\n00:54 Pras Subramanian\nEVs, they killed off the F-150 Lightning EV pickup, which was such a a big deal when it came out in 2022, right? Uh so they're still going to make potentially small to mid-sized EVs. I think that's the sweet spot for where people need to what they want and what the market is underserving right now. So that's their plan. but the downside is, what happens you got to pivot again? There's there's a lot of talk that the EVs might make a comeback, right? Because technology is getting better, better charging, more chargers.\n1:21 Pras Subramanian\nUh that's the problem for Ford is they're they're taking such a swing back in the other direction. Can they still re pivot again?\n1:25 Speaker A\nYeah, I mean that's something Itay Michaeli who I talked to from TD Cowen, he was on the show yesterday and he is optimistic for EVs going into next year. He said because of price and innovation that we will still see demand.\n1:36 Pras Subramanian\nWe'll see.\n1:37 Speaker A\nWhat about General Motors?\n1:38 Pras Subramanian\nI mean, uh I actually quoted in my piece talking about GM being that they're they're better at execution and they're they're sort of a broader portfolio of EVs. So, let's talk about them. Yes, they do have a broader portfolio of EVs. They have the cheaper EVs from the Equinox all the way up to $100,000 Sierra EV truck, right? So they have the whole sort of market there for EVs. Now, obviously the higher end of the market is very challenged. People don't want to spend that kind of money. So they took a charge on that 1.6 billion\n2:08 Pras Subramanian\nlast quarter uh to try to address those EV pivots and things like that, right? But they indicate there's more to come. There's more charges to come. Maybe not 19.5 but more to come. But uh people like talk about how when that tide does turn, GM which is known as a better more efficient operator, they actually have their EVs are a bit more efficient from a cost basis. They can probably capitalize on that and get back into the game, the EV game when and if the market turns.\n2:36 Speaker A\nOkay, and Stellantis, how do they fit into all of this?\n2:39 Pras Subramanian\nSorry, I don't mean to laugh. But um Stelantis has been sort of fits and starts. They were very late to the game. Their their prior CEO Carlos Tovars said, I'm not I don't believe the EV the EV sort of uh road map is going to happen this fast. And he was let go and he may have been right because it was now that Slan's EVs are coming out, there's no one to buy them. In fact, they're uh their their charger uh sports car that was going to be all EV only is now pivoting to gas and\n3:13 Pras Subramanian\nelectric. Uh they're also the Wagoneer is the only other EV they have and it's not really selling that well. It's a Jeep vehicle. Uh and then they're going to bring back the old Hemi V8 to the to the sports cars and the RAM trucks and they got rid of the RAM EV truck. So it's it's more of the same with and other and other automakers here, but I guess the problem is that they sort of they waited so long and they finally came out with the vehicles and then now they're not hitting the mark.\n3:41 Pras Subramanian\nBut the other thing is that they indicated they're going to take charges for the EV business. They have not said so. It's probably going to come out in their second half results. So we'll be watching that. Uh but there's also the euro factor for them. They're very European based, right? And so they have a lot of markets in Europe that do want EVs and they they're able to make smaller EVs with their partnerships. So that's a an interesting thing for them because they have two different very different markets and they have to sort of cater to both.\n4:05 Speaker A\nWell, of course, in Europe though, they're they're competing with Chinese EVs, are they not? And those are are pretty competitive.\n4:11 Speaker A\nUm, you know, it's so interesting to me. It seems like they've really pivoted from like transitioning to EVs to let's offer you a menu, right? And you'll have gasoline powered cars, you'll have hybrids, you'll have EVs and sort of let the consumer make the decision about what they want. But I guess the issue is if consumers really don't want one of those.\n4:37 Pras Subramanian\nWell, I I think it's it's it sounds easier said than done, right? We'll give them whatever they want, but that's billions of dollars in investment. You can't, you know, invest in like making 10,000 EVs. It needs to be a million, right? to make it make sense from an economic point of view. So that's the really big hard place that they find themselves right now is as they pivot to spending more building gas-powered factories for gas-powered cars, what happens when that changes? That's that's the big question.\n5:09 Speaker A\nYes, and will it change whoever the next administration for example is of being. when you're making these long-term big spending plans and you have that kind of uncertainty.\n5:19 Pras Subramanian\nRight, exactly.\n5:20 Speaker A\nNot to mention tariffs, gosh, we didn't even talk about those. There's there's we could do this all day.\n5:24 Pras Subramanian\nI didn't want to get into that.\n5:25 Speaker A\nRight. Fair enough. A little more focused.

      "Content": "EV Dreams Delayed: Why Hybrids Are Suddenly Hot Again\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:06 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIndustry observers suggest the global transition to zero-emission vehicles is unfolding more slowly than many policymakers and automakers once anticipated, prompting a reassessment of how road transport decarbonization could realistically progress. Recent policy signals from Europe appear to support that view. In December, the European Union moved away from a quasi-ban on combustion-engine cars planned for 2035 and instead positioned hybrid vehicles as part of its pathway toward net-zero emissions by 2050. That shift implies regulators are increasingly open to transitional technologies as they balance climate ambitions with consumer affordability and infrastructure readiness.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nFrom the demand side, analysts note that hybrids are gaining traction as fully electric vehicles struggle to broaden their appeal beyond early adopters. EV-focused manufacturers led by Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) helped drive rapid adoption earlier in the decade, but from around 2023, growth has faced headwinds as price sensitivity, range limitations, charging availability and battery longevity concerns weighed on buyers, particularly in Western markets. Hybrids, which pair internal combustion engines with electric motors and smaller batteries, are being viewed by many consumers as a lower-cost way to reduce emissions without changing refueling behavior. Against that backdrop, Western automakers such as Ford Motor ( NYSE:F ) and Volkswagen have been reallocating capital toward hybrids, while Asian manufacturers like Toyota ( NYSE:TM ) and Honda ( NYSE:HMC ), which maintained a multi-pathway strategy, appear increasingly aligned with shifting consumer preferences, especially in parts of southern Europe.\n\nAt the same time, analysts caution that the environmental case for hybrids remains under scrutiny, particularly for plug-in models. Advocacy group Transport & Environment has pointed to data suggesting plug-in hybrids emit about 19% less CO2 per kilometer than petrol and diesel cars on average, with real-world emissions substantially higher than official test results indicate. BloombergNEF has said the EU is in the process of updating its vehicle emissions testing regime, a development that could influence how many hybrids manufacturers are permitted to sell depending on measured emissions performance. As a result, while hybrids could play a more durable role in the transition than previously expected, their regulatory treatment and long-term positioning remain subject to evolving policy and data outcomes.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Bubbles and Boring Bets: What’s Coming for Tech Stocks in 2026\n\nJeran Wittenstein, Ryan Vlastelica and Carmen Reinicke\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:11 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nPLTR\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Investors will remember 2025 as the year the artificial intelligence rally broadened out and the fears became more pronounced — not only of a bubble in the stocks, but also of the disruption the technology represents.\nWhile tech giants like Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp. delivered strong gains, unsung corners of the industry, like memory chips and hard disk drives, proved to be far better places for investors. Meanwhile, the threat of competition from deep-pocketed heavyweights and upstarts like OpenAI and Anthropic weighed on software makers that are considered most at risk from challengers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNYC’s Adams Names Four to Rent Board in Challenge to Mamdani\nWith the bull market in US stocks stretching into a fourth year, there are more concerns than ever about the sustainability of heavy spending on AI computing and whether the returns will justify the investments.\n“There’s a lot of optimism around AI, but also a lot of hype,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. “2026 will be more about the proof of AI. What’s the ROI on the hyperscalers that have been spending? Will they see profit growth continue to accelerate?”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the biggest stock market stories for the tech industry in 2025 and the outlook for each in the new year.\nNeocloud Nerves\nNeoclouds, which are companies that provide cloud-computing services tailored to AI customers, were the rage for most of 2025. But heading into 2026 they look more like proxies for AI bubble risk.\nGrowing scrutiny over OpenAI’s lack of profitability has raised questions about its ability to pay for its massive spending commitments, including a cloud-computing deal with Oracle Corp. said to be worth $300 billion over five years. Oracle was expected to be a major beneficiary of AI growth, but its stock is down more than 45% through Thursday’s close since hitting a peak in September as its exposure to OpenAI becomes a major concern. Oracle shares were up about 6% in early trading Friday as TikTok said it is being bought by a group of buyers led by the software company.\n“There is a lot of fear with OpenAI and the commitments it has made,” said Adam Rich, who helps oversee more than $17 billion in assets as deputy chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Vaughan Nelson. “People can only forecast what we know, and right now there’s a lot we don’t know. So long as that’s the case, it will be hard for companies like Oracle to regain their luster.”\n\nStory Continues\nOracle has other issues, including the amount of money it’s spending on data center leases, reported delays in some data center projects, and financing questions. Its growing debt load is particularly concerning to investors, as a measure of the company’s credit risk has skyrocketed to its highest level since the financial crisis.\n\nBeyond Oracle, neocloud provider CoreWeave Inc. has lost about two-thirds of its market value since hitting a high in June. And Nebius Group NV shares are down more than 42% from an October peak through Thursday’s close.\nBoring Tech\nInvestors discovered new AI trades in 2025 by following where the billions of dollars in pledged capital expenditures are going. You can see it just by looking at the top performers in the S&P 500 Index. Memory and storage company Sandisk Corp. leads the list, followed by Western Digital Corp, which makes hard disk drives, and its rival Seagate Technology Holdings Plc. Micron Technology Inc., the biggest US-based maker of memory chips, is fifth.\nThe trend is expected to continue in 2026 as capital expenditures keep growing. Investors are increasingly thinking about where the next wave is headed, with some eyeing beaten-down software stocks.\n“Things at the edge are interesting,” said Melissa Otto, who heads technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “There is this AI ecosystem that orbits around the AI infrastructure itself.”\n\nSoftware Slump\nSoftware stocks traded at attractive market valuations in 2025, but that did little to entice investors. Shares of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies were hit particularly hard. Much of the weakness reflects growing fears that the group will be disrupted by AI, as offerings from services like ChatGPT and Alphabet’s Gemini cut into demand or pricing power.\nAI represents “existential competition” for some software companies as “AI chatbot and agent dominance becomes the core battlefield,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note this week.\nCompanies like ServiceNow Inc., Adobe Inc., and Salesforce Inc. were among the weakest performers in the tech sector this year. A Morgan Stanley index of SaaS companies is down 10%, compared with a gain of about 6% for a broader software index that includes perceived AI winners like Microsoft Corp.\nWhether software’s underperformance continues will be a key stock market theme in 2026. Some Wall Street pros already think it’s overdone. The SaaS group “is trading anywhere between a 30-40% discount relative to what its fundamentals would suggest,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month.\n\nPricey Got Pricier\nConcerns that nose-bleed valuations would hamper the ascent of some of 2024’s hottest stocks in 2025 proved misplaced. Palantir Technologies Inc. turned out to be one of the year’s best performers despite trading at more than 200 times estimated profits for much of the year. The stock’s nearly 150% advance ranks eighth in the S&P 500.\nWall Street has long been skeptical of Palantir, mainly because of the stock’s lofty valuation. Of the 29 the analysts covering the maker of data analysis software, just nine rate the stock a buy. Still, the company is expected to expand at an enviable clip, with revenue projected to jump 43% in 2026 and 39% in 2027, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nElectric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. also overcame concerns about its valuation, which is by far the most expensive among the so-called Magnificent Seven. The stock hit a record this week despite trading at more than 200 times anticipated profits and facing a number of headwinds from slowing EV sales to concerns about safety.\n\nInvestors are optimistic about Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s vision of a self-driving car future and nascent push into robotics. After two years of stagnant revenue growth, Tesla’s sales are expected to expand 13% in 2026 and 19% in 2027.\nAll of which leaves the tech landscape heading into 2026 roughly where it was a year ago. Yes, the stocks are pricey. But the opportunities for growth are there. It’s up to the companies to deliver.\n“Expectations are high and valuations are expensive,” Ameriprise’s Saglimbene said. “That means they have more to prove, and they will really have to exceed expectations to move higher.”\n--With assistance from Phil Serafino and Stephen Kirkland.\n(Updates stock moves throughout, adds detail in paragraph seven.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

The move comes after Tesla shares pulled back from record highs earlier in the week. TSLA closed Thursday up about 3%, at $483.37.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NKE.\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nARK shifted the capital to cryptocurrency-focused names, including Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ:COIN ) and Brera Holdings (SLMT). It bought 17,386 shares of COIN across multiple ETFs for roughly $4.15 million. The purchase follows Coinbase's plan to launch commission-free U.S. stock trading with extended hours.\nThe firm also added 575,644 shares of Brera Holdings, valued at about $1.4 million. Brera has drawn attention for its Solana-based treasury strategy. Brera shares rose about 1% to $2.39 on Thursday.\nBeyond crypto, ARK bought 755,538 shares of Recursion Pharmaceuticals ( NASDAQ:RXRX ) across ARKG and ARKK. Analysts continue to track Tesla stock closely, maintaining a Hold consensus with an average price target implying more than 21% downside risk.\nCathie Wood's ARK Invest has been selling portions of its Tesla holdings not because she's turned bearish long-term, but to rebalance portfolios and manage risk after gains, reduce concentration in a huge flagship position and fund buys in other high-conviction names like Robinhood, Block and crypto-related stocks.\nRecent filings show systematic sales across ARK ETFs while still keeping Tesla as a top holding, suggesting profit-taking and strategic repositioning rather than a full exit.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It has more than doubled since April, and recently shrugged off a 20% decline. In other words, nothing out of the ordinary for Elon Musk’s $1.6 trillion market cap baby.\nTo say that TSLA is a great trading stock is the understatement of the year. When a stock essentially moves like a 4x ETF, there’s plenty of opportunities to get in. And out, in, and out again. Often all within a matter of months, if not weeks, depending on a trader’s time frame.\n\nMore News from Barchart Exposing the Hidden Geometry of Palo Alto (PANW) Stock Most Investors Will Miss\n2 Option Trade Ideas To Consider This Thursday\nThis Unusually Active Avantor Put Raises the Question: Who’s the Patsy?\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nYet Wall Street, perhaps finding difficulty in taming the beast that is TSLA’s stock price, much less its forward-looking fundamentals, has a net “Hold” rating on it. And has for a few months now. With a stock like this, there are uber-long-term holders, who embrace the vision of Musk, and traders who have made a nice living buying and selling it on every 10%-30% wiggle.\nThe company has had a tumultuous year, which started with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in DC, continued with a pay package for the ages, and currently could be described as a double top. As in, the stock price’s return to the $490 area.\nOne of the math games I like to use in coaching investors and traders goes like this: Which would you rather own?\nA stock up 50% in less than 4 months?\nA stock flat for 12 months?\nThe good news for Tesla fans is that they get both! The returns for different time frames below add up to chaos, for long-term holders.\nAnd we should assume TSLA will not go quietly into the future. So let’s examine the charts and consider one possibility that probably does not make the headlines.\nA darling stock selling at more than 400x forward earnings is going to be volatile. And 16x sales is pretty elevated, to put it mildly. So let’s go with the idea that for some investors, while they are comfortable holding some shares of TSLA stock, they’d consider having a portion of it act more like a bond. Or perhaps a buffer note ETF.\nTLSA bulls will point to this and see “breakout coming.” And they might be right. But bears might see a retrenchment from around these levels.\nWhat Risk Manager Rob Sees I see, from among many TSLA collar combinations, a way to own TSLA, write calls and buy puts on it, go out 2 years, and set myself up so that the worst case is I break even. My upside? About 10% a year, or close to 20% over 2 years. My stress level? Very low.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd as I see it, if the stock, which I’m daring to go above $550 during that time, does so, I can just buy some more shares. Or rebalance the collar levels. 20% upside, and 0.3% downside over 2 years, on this stock? THAT is turning volatility into opportunity.\nRob Isbitts, founder of Sungarden Investment Publishing, is a semi-retired chief investment officer, whose current research is found here at Barchart, and at his ETF Yourself subscription service on Substack .

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nSafe & Green Holdings Completes Strategic Acquisition of Giant Containers\n\nSafe and Green Holdings Corp.\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SGBX\n\nTSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nGM\n\nNKE\n\nConroe, Texas, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CONROE, Texas, Dec 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN - Safe & Green Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: SGBX) (“Safe & Green” or the “Company”), announced that it has successfully closed the acquisition of Giant Containers Inc. (“Giant Containers”), a leading manufacturer of custom modular shipping container solutions for residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional applications. The transaction was completed through a combination of cash and stock consideration.\n\nThe acquisition of Giant Containers represents a key milestone in Safe & Green’s long-term strategy to become a value-added infrastructure solutions provider, strengthening its capabilities across design, engineering, sales, and project execution.\nGiant Containers brings a highly recognized brand with an established customer base that includes globally recognized organizations such as Tesla, Amazon, General Motors, Nike, and Yale University. At the time of acquisition, Giant Containers has over $5 million in projects under contract, with an additional $22.5 million in its pipeline.\nThe combination of the two companies addresses complementary strengths. Giant Containers’ core strength in sales, marketing, and project management align with areas of strategic focus for Safe & Green, while Safe & Green’s in-house production and manufacturing capabilities directly address Giant Containers’ need for scalable domestic fabrication, an increasingly critical requirement for larger enterprise and government customers.\n\nIn addition, Giant Containers contributes deep expertise in sourcing and managing purpose-built container systems from offshore suppliers, creating cost and quality advantages for complex, multi-container projects designed to integrate seamlessly at scale.\nAs part of the transaction, Daniel Kroft, Founder and CEO of Giant Containers, elected to receive a portion of the consideration in restricted Safe & Green Holdings common stock, reinforcing long-term alignment with the Company’s growth strategy.\n“We are very excited about this strategic acquisition of Giant Containers. It was a key foundation stone in our corporate strategy to become a value-added energy provider, and we are now empowered with sales, design, and engineering capabilities for containerized power generation, crypto mining, and data center solutions. The current AI-driven trend is hungry for power, and we are well positioned to meet that demand using our own resources. Our streamlined vision is to control the supply chain from subsurface to end user, and with Giant Containers onboard, we now have a critical component to execute that strategy,” said Michael McLaren, CEO of Safe & Green.\n\nStory continues\nDaniel Kroft, Founder and CEO of Giant Containers, added, “Giant Containers is thrilled to announce being acquired by Safe & Green Holdings, a move that positions the company to advance its growth plans with even greater confidence. This transaction provides the infrastructure necessary to support larger, more complex projects and introduces our new production facility in Texas, enhancing our capacity to serve clients nationwide and abroad.”\n\n“The acquisition capitalizes on strong synergies between both teams and the depth of human capital across the organizations, fueling optimism through a shared vision and aligned goals for Giant Containers. I’m particularly excited about entering an entirely new market by developing solutions tailored to the oil, gas, and energy industry, guided by the expertise of Mike McLaren and the team at Olenox. This new framework allows us to dedicate even more manpower to business development and the global rollout of our unique product offerings.”\nAbout Giant Containers\nFounded in 2017, Giant Containers is a leading designer and integrator of custom container-based solutions for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers. The company specializes in transforming shipping containers into highly engineered structures for applications ranging from modular buildings to specialized infrastructure solutions, serving clients across North America and internationally.\n\nAbout Safe & Green Holdings Corp.\nSafe & Green Holdings Corp., a leading modular solutions company, operates under core capabilities which include the development, design, and fabrication of modular structures, meeting the demand for safe and green solutions across various industries.

      "Content": "The top 10 trending tickers of 2025 on Yahoo Finance\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Jared Blikre\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nSMCI\n\nPLTR\n\nAMD\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Palantir ( PLTR ) are some of the top-viewed ticker pages on Yahoo Finance in 2025.\nYahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre , who also hosts Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast , examines the 10 most popular ticker pages on Yahoo Finance, with AI names dominating the list, with the exception of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ).\nCatch more Stocks in Translation , with new episodes every Tuesday and Thursday.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:04 Speaker A\n2025 has been a year of surprises. At the outset, many pros were doubting that year three of this bull market could match the outside gains of the prior two.\n00:13 Speaker A\nBut the AI trade keeps driving attention and driving behavior. And on today's stocks in translation, we're not looking at the best performers of 2025. We are looking at the names that you, the viewers, checked in on the most on the Yahoo Finance platform. And we're breaking down our top 10 trending tickers of 2025.\n00:32 Speaker A\nSo let's take a look at the scores on the door. and here we got the top 10 tickers. The first thing you might notice is that this is an AI dominated list with maybe Bitcoin in the middle as the exception.\n00:46 Speaker A\nThen you're going to see the perennial favorites, uh that's Nvidia and Tesla to the left there. They are in a different zip code. Our Nvidia quote page has a cool quarter billion page views this year, while Tesla clocks in at over 180 million.\n01:03 Speaker A\nAnd while Apple is usually top three, it was edged out this year by Palantir with nearly 100 million views. And from there things stabilize as AMD, Amazon, Bitcoin, Meta, Super Micro and Intel, they all clocked 40 to 60 million viewers each.\n01:17 Speaker A\nNow, let's take a look at this list from a different perspective. This is our Yahoo Finance heat map and we're looking at the box size right here. So each box size corresponds to the market cap of the company and all of these are large to mega caps with two in the $4 trillion bucket. That would be Nvidia and Apple,\n01:36 Speaker A\nall the way down to Intel over here at 180 billion. and in the far lower right, you almost can't see it there. You can see Super Micro, which is just shy of $20 billion. But the other thing you might notice is that the only losing ticker this year is Bitcoin, although Amazon is pretty close to break even too.\n01:52 Speaker A\nSo each of these has a different story. Now let's dive into some of the charts that really uh tell this story and this is going to be a year-to-date. So we'll start with Nvidia here. This has arguably been the poster child for the entire AI trade and you can see it got kind of sucked into the post liberation day redness there, but it has bounced back strong.\n02:09 Speaker A\nReally hasn't done much over the last few months, but with 30% gains in a year after almost being up, what is it? a thousand percent over the last three years. There you go, 963%. I think investors are going to take that.\n02:19 Speaker A\nNow Tesla. Tesla's really interesting because over the last year, and this is a three-year chart too, it has traced out a cup and handle formation. If it can break above 480, it has the ability to really break out and 2026 could be the year to do this. If it fails at this level, well, maybe it's got to consolidate a little bit longer.\n02:37 Speaker A\nNow, let's take a look at Palantir. This stock is up 2,500% over the last three years. Let's dial down to a year-to-date and you can see like Nvidia, it hasn't really done much over the last few months, but still sitting on 140% year-to-date gains.\n02:50 Speaker A\nNow, Apple year to date, this stock is only up 9%, but it has come back nicely after it just kind of stalled out after the liberation day uh melee where a lot of stocks were taking off, it was going sideways, but it finally caught up over the last few months. and so Apple has been generating recent record highs even as Nvidia has been going sideways.\n03:07 Speaker A\nNow here's AMD to round out the top five, 71% year to date. This is a very volatile stock, but again, I think investors will uh happily hold on to gains like that for a stock like AMD.\n03:16 Speaker A\nNow, Amazon, barely positive for the year. This is a stock you kind of got to look at over this entire three-year bull market. Still up 150%, but this was a year of consolidation. We'll have to see if 2026 breaks to the upside or the downside.\n03:30 Speaker A\nAnd you know what? Bitcoin is a very similar story, sitting on more gains over the last three years, but this has been a year of consolidation. It happens to be down about 10% right now, and 75,000 is a line in the sand that I am watching. I think that gets hit before it takes off again.\n03:44 Speaker A\nThen Meta, this is another three-year story. Uh hasn't done much this year, but we'll have to see if it can continue the trend. 445%, very strong over this bull market.\n03:53 Speaker A\nGetting towards the end here. Super Micro is a very volatile stock and while it's up this year a decent percentage, you can see it was up a lot more in early 2024. So this is one of those high beta plays you got to trade with caution, but guess what, the Yahoo Finance audience loves to day trade this stock.\n04:06 Speaker A\nAnd finally here's Intel. This is another kind of uh sine wave pattern here. Let me just dial this down to year to date so you can see it has really taken off over the last few months. It's become a volatile stock, but it was doing nothing for the first 6, seven, eight months of the year. So I think investors at the end of the day, at the end of the year going to be pleased with this one.\n04:24 Speaker A\nSo let us dial it back down here. I got a few things that are going to tell us what to watch in 2026. So just think of these as the questions that move these tickers. First is the AI spend payback test. Investors are going to want to see the revenue and not just the profits of these uh companies, not just the spending.\n04:42 Speaker A\nAnd the next up is margins versus Mega Cap spending. Can these giants keep growing without the profit engine getting dented? Third, keep an eye on the chip cycle inflection point. Does demand for semiconductors, does it broaden out or is it just stay limited to AI?\n04:59 Speaker A\nFourth, watch those crypto regulation headlines. 2025 was arguably the best year ever for crypto regulation and Bitcoin isn't even positive. So let's see if sentiment can shift. And finally, monitor those rate cuts versus the real economy. If we get more cuts, ask why. Is it a soft landing scenario or are we sinking into recession?\n05:17 Speaker A\nBottom line, these were the tickers investors just could not stop watching in 2025. Next year, what matters is whether the stories hold up and that's where the rubber meets the road. And tune into the Stocks and Translation podcast for more jargon busting deep dives.

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights CAPITAL ONE, MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL and Tesla's\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:54 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nCOF\n\nCOF-PK\n\nCOF-PL\n\nCOF-PN\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 19, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights CAPITAL ONE COF, MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL MAR and Tesla's TSLA\n3 STOCKS TO WATCH NEAR ALL-TIME HIGHS: COF, MAR, TSLA An easing in inflation pressures helped stabilize markets in Thursday's trading session, although a few notable stocks had already printed fresh highs ahead of November's favorable CPI report. Being leaders in their respective industries, investors are surely wondering if higher highs are in store for three of these popular stocks in particular. This makes it an ideal time to take a look at the trend of earnings estimate revisions, the primary influencer to the Zacks Rank.\n\nCAPITAL ONE ZACKS RANK #1 (STRONG BUY) With its stock hitting a new all-time high of $244 a share, Capital On is in more wallets following the successful acquisition of Discover Financial earlier in the year.\nAcquiring Discover has transformed Capital One into a market leader by giving it both size and infrastructure, combining one of the largest credit card issuers with a major payments network. Becoming a vertically integrated powerhouse in consumer finance, Capital One stock is up +35% in 2025, and EPS revisions have continued to soar thanks to strong financial results and shareholder-friendly buybacks.\n\nCapital One's annual earnings are now expected to leap 41% in fiscal 2025 to $19.77 per share compared to EPS of $13.96 last year. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected at over $20.00, and COF trades at a very attractive 12X forward earnings multiple.\nMARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL ZACKS RANK #3 (HOLD) $311 a share set a record for the renowned hotel operator's stock on Wednesday, but the price performance here has been less captivating. Marriott International's stock is up +10% year to date, and its steady EPS growth is accompanied by a modest 0.86% annual dividend yield that's currently at $2.80. It's also intriguing that Marriott has increased its dividend by 28% in the last five years, and its 27% payout ratio indicates there is plenty of room for more hikes in the future as one of the most established and well-managed hospitality companies. Although a sound long-term investment, Marriott's somewhat stagnant stock performance may continue, as FY25 EPS estimates have barely increased in the last 90 days and FY26 revisions are slightly down.\n\nTESLA ZACKS RANK #3 (HOLD) Fresh all-time highs of $495 a share come as investors have been more excited about Tesla's robotaxi program, AI integration, androbotics ambitions, even as EV sales have slowed. Notably, Tesla has been testing driverless robotaxis without safety\n\nLeer más\nmonitors, a major milestone that investors see as proof of progress toward autonomous mobility. Elon Musk has also announced that Tesla's in-car systems will integrate Grok, an AI chatbot, boosting confidence in Tesla's ability to monetize AI. Regarding robotics, Tesla's humanoid robot project, Optimus, is seen as a long-term growth driver, adding to the narrative that Tesla is more than just an EV company. While these are exciting developments, EPS revisions are modestly lower in the last 60 days for FY25 and FY26. Considering such, the recent momentum in TSLA could be short-lived, with most of the +20% YTD gains coming in the last month. Still, Tesla has been able to avoid a sell rating as a sharp rebound is expected on its top and bottom lines next year.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) is one of the Buzzing AI Stocks on Wall Street. On December 16, Mizuho reiterated the stock as “Outperform” and raised its price target to $530 from $475. The firm said it's bullish on Tesla's robotaxi efforts.\nThe stock has been on the radar recently, particularly due to its robotaxi efforts. CEO Elon Musk tweeted earlier how Tesla has been testing robo-taxis without safety monitors in the car. This marks another step forward for the company towards services expansion across the U.S.\nWhile the company’s robo-taxi service launched with safety monitors sitting in the front passenger seat, Musk hopes to remove the monitors by year’s end.\nThe analyst looked at Alphabet’s Waymo to figure out how Tesla’s improvements can translate into more robo-taxi business. Waymo delivers 450,000 fully automated rides per week, and aims to reach 1 million trips per week by the end of 2026.\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Are Democrats Still Buying Teslas? Are Republicans Replacing Lost Buyers? Here's What the Data Says\n\nWilliam Dahl, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nABI.BR\n\nKey Points In these polarized times, Elon Musk's vocal political activity risked alienating millions of potential customers in a niche of the consumer discretionary sector.\n2024 marked Tesla's first fall in car sales in 12 years.\nMusk's political activity likely hurt the company, but Tesla faces bigger questions in 2026 and beyond.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nIn some businesses, CEOs can wade into politics without fearing a consumer backlash. On the left, George Soros doesn't need to raise capital from Republican voters. On the right, boycotts of Koch Industries would be difficult since its asphalt, electronic components, advanced fabrics, and other products aren't consumer-facing.\nBut in the consumer discretionary sector, it's a different story. Anyone can change their beer order on a dime, as Anheuser-Busch InBev discovered when Bud Light lost its crown as America's top-selling beer after backlash from a 2023 advertising campaign. It's the same with fast food, which may be why Chick-fil-A's CEO expressed regret for linking his company to the culture wars.\nElectric vehicles are as \"consumer discretionary\" as it gets. Consumers can even opt out of buying them entirely, as around 90% of U.S. drivers still did as of early 2025.\nSo, in a nation where 75 million people voted for Kamala Harris for president, has Tesla CEO Elon Musk's full-throated support for President Donald Trump cost Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) ?\n\nA study by four Yale University professors found that since 2022, Tesla saw a sharp decline in sales in blue counties that wasn't offset by gains in red areas. The researchers concluded that Musk's political activities cost the company 1.26 million vehicles sold.\nIt's a rigorous study, but it's still just one study. Are signs of this brand damage showing up in Tesla's balance sheets? Here's what the numbers say.\nHow were Tesla sales last year? In the fourth quarter of 2024, with the election in full swing and political sensitivities at their highest, Tesla reported an 8% decrease in car sales year-over-year. For Q1 2025, as Musk came to be seen as a key player in the Trump administration, revenue from car sales fell 20% year-over-year. Third-quarter sales saw a spike, up 6% from the previous year, but that was most likely caused by buyers rushing to complete purchase before a $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired Sept. 30.\nTesla bulls might point out that, over the span of Musk's three-year political journey, which began in 2022, Tesla saw a 67% increase in revenue and a 43% rise in net income before taxes. Those increases are well above the 20% inflation that has taken place since 2021.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Tesla's profits took a hit in 2024, falling from $15 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion, and annual sales fell 1.8 million from 2023. That was the first decline in car sales that Tesla experienced in 12 years, which is striking considering that Tesla cut prices. It's strong evidence that the Yale study is correct that political brand damage hurt Tesla sales.\n\nIs Tesla a buy today? In the month following Election Day last November, Tesla shares rose 69%, as traders priced in the expected value of a CEO with the president-elect's ear. With hindsight, the rally appears misguided, as the Trump administration seems to have harmed Tesla on balance.\nAccording to J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, Tesla could lose over half of its annual earnings from the administration's policies, like the loss of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit . As one company executive told The Financial Times , \"There's no question that Tesla will be hit harder than most.\"\n\nYet Tesla is more than just a car company. In 2024, roughly 10% of its revenue came from energy generation and storage, while 10.5% came from other services. Musk has said that 80% of Tesla's value will one day come from its Optimus robots, which would begin mass production in late 2026 at the earliest. During last quarter's earnings call , Musk said Optimus has the potential to be \"the biggest product of all time.\"\nTesla has several paths to glory, and any brand damage from politics is already priced into shares. But their price-to-earnings ratio of 312 is, for such an established company, a little too steep for me. With so many question marks around the company, from the success or failure of Optimus to the battle for market share, Tesla's \"priced for perfection\" valuation seems unreasonable. I'm taking a \"wait and see\" approach on the stock.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Shares have rocketed higher over the past decade. And they currently trade at record levels.\nMore recently, though, shareholders have dealt with a different reality. If you had invested $1,000 in Tesla shares one year ago, here's how much you'd have today.\nShareholders need to fasten their seatbelts Tesla proves that even the most valuable companies can experience heightened levels of volatility. During the three months leading up to mid-March this year, the stock had dropped 49%. Shares have more than doubled over the following nine months, as market sentiment improved drastically.\nAll told, this electric vehicle (EV) stock is up 9% over the past 12 months (as of Dec. 16). A $1,000 starting investment would be worth $1,090 today. That's not impressive.\n\nExpectations could not be higher Despite underperforming the market in the last year, Tesla shares trade at a nosebleed valuation. The current price-to-earnings ratio of 318 shows just how bullish investors have become about the company's autonomous driving and humanoid robotics efforts. Progress is being made, but there is still a lot of long-term uncertainty around tech development and customer adoption.\n\nTesla needs to execute flawlessly to live up to the valuation.

      "Content": "Top-rated analyst drops curt 8-word take on Tesla stock\n\nMoz Farooque\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 3:08 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n“Only about $30-$40 per share in that business.”\nThat curt assessment comes from five-star analyst Jed Dorsheimer of William Blair, highlighting just how differently the market now views Tesla stock.\nAlthough EVs still generate the lion’s share of its sales ( over 75% in Q3), Dorsheimer feels that investors value Tesla more like an AI and robotics player .\n\nRecent gains in Tesla stock are reflective of that shift.\nFor perspective, Tesla stock has risen a remarkable 48% over the past six months and 14.3% in the past month alone.\nConsequently, Tesla stock is now trading at over 380 times forward GAAP earnings , a dizzying 1,820% higher than the sector median.\nAdditionally, it trades at over 17 times forward sales estimates , which is roughly 1,672% higher than the sector median.\nFollowing its superb run-up, Wall Street consensus estimates point to a 15.3% downside , to $395.73, expecting a bumpy road ahead for the stock.\nThose gains point to a growing optimism around Tesla’s potent robotaxi division, full self-driving progress, and its much-talked-about Optimus robot, which has helped shift the narrative away from the sluggishness in its EV division.\nNaturally, that creates a clear disconnect that the investing world just can’t ignore.\nHence, Tesla’s valuation is tied to future breakthroughs. However, its bottom-line health is still dependent on what has become a highly regulated, competitive auto market, creating an obvious dichotomy.\nTesla’s valuation has quietly moved beyond cars Dorsheimer isn’t approaching Tesla stock through the lens we’ve grown accustomed to over the years, and that difference matters.\nAccording to TipRanks , William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer is a five-star analyst who is ranked #308 out of 10,192 Wall Street analysts, positioning him at the top tier of all tracked analysts.\n\nDorsheimer’s calls have generated an average return of +26.9% per rating, underscoring strong upside capture when he’s right.\nMore Tesla:\nTesla fatal crash lawsuit takes a wild turn\nTesla: what must happen for the $1 trillion payout\nTesla accused of not following key law\nTesla has more bad news for Cybertruck lovers\nIn his analysis, Tesla’s valuation quietly moved away from its hugely popular vehicle business toward longer-term (some would say moon-shot) bets in autonomy and energy.\nTherefore, if we encounter an uninspiring quarterly delivery report or pricing issues, the stock is unlikely to react in the same manner as it did in the past.\nHe believes Tesla is in the midst of a strategic transition, with investor interest focused on full self-driving technology, robotics, and a growing energy platform.\n\nStory Continues\nDorsheimer offered further detail on Yahoo Finance .\nIn Dorsheimer’s model, autonomy currently accounts for approximately 70% of Tesla’s value, where execution on future technologies becomes all the more important.\n“If you value Tesla as an auto company, it's just the wrong framework,” CEO Elon Musk shared in Tesla’s Q1 2024 earnings call from last year.\n\nRelated: History of Tesla & its stock: Timeline, facts & milestones\nWhat major banks say Tesla stock is really worth The shift in how Tesla stock is valued isn’t limited to a single analyst.\nAcross Wall Street, Tesla is being modeled more as a portfolio of future technologies instead of an EV giant.\nAlthough differences over the upside remain, the common thread is virtually the same, in that Tesla’s car business plays a shrinking role.\n\nRelated: Veteran analyst makes jaw-dropping call on Tesla stock\nAdditionally, a significant portion of Tesla’s non-automotive promise is already reflected in the stock price, offering virtually no margin for error.\nBank of America employs a sum-of-the-parts model, assigning 45% of Tesla’s value to Robotaxis, 17% to Full Self-Driving, and 19% to Optimus. In comparison, it assigns just 12% for core automotive, describing the setup as mostly “stretched.”\nMorgan Stanley concurs with BofA and has reduced the weight of the auto business (valued at $55 per share) , with a focus on network services, Robotaxis, and humanoid robots. Additionally, it raised its price target on the stock to $425 from $410 while downgrading it, arguing that much of the upside from non-auto initiatives is already priced in.\nGoldman Sachs remains neutral while framing autonomy as Tesla’s key growth engine. Its caution mainly centers on its bottom line, with competition and regulation likely to cap margin growth.\nRelated: Facebook makes daring move to challenge Disney, Netflix\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 18, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Dec. 18: Rivian Automotive Surges To 52-Week High After Analyst Upgrade and Higher Price Target\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:47 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nTSLA\n\nF\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) , electric truck and SUV maker, closed Thursday’s session at $20.28, up 15.03%. Rivian Automotive IPO'd in 2021 and has fallen about 75% since going public. Trading volume reached 66.4 million shares, about 36% above its three-month average of 49 million shares.\n\nThursday’s move followed a Robert W. Baird upgrade and new price target, while investors are watching how Rivian executes its autonomy roadmap and 2026 R2 launch.\n\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) added 0.79% to finish at 6,774, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 1.38% to 23,006. Within electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, industry peers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 3.45% and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) edged higher by 0.08%, highlighting diverging reactions to product and strategy updates across major EV names.\n\nWhat this means for investors Baird's new price target still implies upside of 25% from Rivian's closing price today. The Wall Street firm's \"buy\" rating comes as Rivian is poised to increase sales and brand recognition with its upcoming R2 SUV.\nRivian also gave investors a roadmap for its path to produce a fully autonomous vehicle in its autonomy and AI day presentation last week. It impressed investors by revealing an in-house AI chip for its autonomy platform. That would likely spur demand further and offer Rivian a new revenue source.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Stocks to Watch Near All-Time Highs: COF, MAR, TSLA\n\nShaun Pruitt\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 1:55 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: COF\n\nCOF-PK\n\nCOF-PL\n\nCOF-PN\n\nTSLA\n\nAn easing in inflation pressures helped stabilize markets in Thursday’s trading session, although a few notable stocks had already printed fresh highs ahead of November's favorable CPI report.\nBeing leaders in their respective industries, investors are surely wondering if higher highs are in store for three of these popular stocks in particular.\n\nThis makes it an ideal time to take a look at the trend of earnings estimate revisions, the primary influencer to the Zacks Rank.\n\nCapital One – COF Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) With its stock hitting a new all-time high of $244 a share, Capital One COF is in more wallets following the successful acquisition of Discover Financial earlier in the year.\nAcquiring Discover has transformed Capital One into a market leader by giving it both size and infrastructure, combining one of the largest credit card issuers with a major payments network. Becoming a vertically integrated powerhouse in consumer finance, Capital One stock is up +35% in 2025, and EPS revisions have continued to soar thanks to strong financial results and shareholder-friendly buybacks.\nCapital One’s annual earnings are now expected to leap 41% in fiscal 2025 to $19.77 per share compared to EPS of $13.96 last year. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected at over $20.00, and COF trades at a very attractive 12X forward earnings multiple.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMarriott International – MAR Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) $311 a share set a record for the renowned hotel operator's stock on Wednesday, but the price performance here has been less captivating. Marriott International's MAR stock is up +10% year to date, and its steady EPS growth is accompanied by a modest 0.86% annual dividend yield that’s currently at $2.80.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIt’s also intriguing that Marriott has increased its dividend by 28% in the last five years, and its 27% payout ratio indicates there is plenty of room for more hikes in the future as one of the most established and well-managed hospitality companies.\nAlthough a sound long-term investment, Marriott’s somewhat stagnant stock performance may continue, as FY25 EPS estimates have barely increased in the last 90 days and FY26 revisions are slightly down.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla – TSLA Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Fresh all-time highs of $495 a share come as investors have been more excited about Tesla’s TSLA robotaxi program, AI integration, and robotics ambitions, even as EV sales have slowed.\nNotably, Tesla has been testing driverless robotaxis without safety monitors, a major milestone that investors see as proof of progress toward autonomous mobility. Elon Musk has also announced that Tesla’s in-car systems will integrate Grok, an AI chatbot, boosting confidence in Tesla’s ability to monetize AI. Regarding robotics, Tesla’s humanoid robot project, Optimus, is seen as a long-term growth driver, adding to the narrative that Tesla is more than just an EV company.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile these are exciting developments, EPS revisions are modestly lower in the last 60 days for FY25 and FY26. Considering such, the recent momentum in TSLA could be short-lived, with most of the +20% YTD gains coming in the last month. Still, Tesla has been able to avoid a sell rating as a sharp rebound is expected on its top and bottom lines next year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Should You Buy Tesla While It's Below $500?\n\nChris Neiger, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 12:40 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Tesla's operating expenses increased by 50% in the third quarter and are likely to remain elevated as it spends billions of dollars to expand into robotics and autonomy.\nMeanwhile, Tesla's core EV business is suffering, and vehicle sales fell below 40,000 in November.\nTesla's stock is priced for perfection at a time when the company is trying to get back on track.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a fantastic stock for long-term investors, with returns exceeding 3,100% over the past decade. However, the company currently faces significant headwinds, as sales of its electric vehicles (EVs) are slowing, costs are rising, and it places big bets on unproven markets including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs).\nIt's no surprise, then, that many investors are trying to determine what to do with Tesla stock. Is it a good time to buy with its shares priced under $500, or is it too early to take a risk on the company transitioning toward future technologies when its EV business is slumping?\nHere are three reasons why I believe it's best not to buy Tesla stock right now.\n1. Expenses are rising fast Tesla CEO Elon Musk is transitioning his company toward an autonomous vehicle and robotics company. The idea is for Tesla to mass-produce its Optimus robots -- up to 1 million by 2030 -- and for the company to vastly expand its fledgling robotaxi service that's currently only in a handful of cities. It's worth noting Musk said in July the service would cover half the country by the end of the year, which is now, and it's nowhere near achieving this.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with Tesla focusing on these two opportunities, considering that AVs could eventually be worth $1.4 trillion by 2040, and humanoid robotics will be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050.\nBut to achieve its goals, Tesla is spending heavily, and it's likely to increase from here. The company's operating expenses rose by 50% to $3.4 billion in the third quarter, and research and development (R&D) costs jumped 57% to $1.6 billion. Management specifically said the operating cost increase was \"driven by SG&A [selling, general, and administrative], AI and other R&D projects.\"\nFor Tesla to expand into nascent robotics and AV markets, additional billions of dollars will need to be spent at a time when the company's core business -- selling electric vehicles -- isn't doing so hot.\n\n2. Tesla's core business is suffering It's easy to get caught up in Tesla's big plans to be an autonomous vehicle and robotics company, but Tesla is still primarily an electric vehicle company right now. Unfortunately, business is not so good.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla's net income fell 37% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter, leaving the company with significantly less money to reinvest in the business.\nThings could be getting worse, too. Following the expiration of the federal EV tax credits, Tesla's vehicle sales fell below 40,000 in November -- its lowest monthly sales in years. Tesla's third-quarter results temporarily received a boost as customers rushed to take advantage before credits expired at the end of September, which helped lift Tesla's revenue 12% to $28 billion in the quarter.\n\nHowever, the November vehicle sales numbers indicate that Tesla and other EV manufacturers have a significant problem on their hands. EVs often cost more than traditional gas-powered vehicles, and after years of inflation and high interest rates, and no more tax credits, there's less demand for EVs than in the recent past.\nThis would be a significant problem on its own for Tesla, but it's compounded by the fact that the company is spending so much to move into robotics and AVs.\n3. Its stock is expensive Even if Tesla somehow pulls off its transition to AVs and robotics and turns around its stumbling EV business, it doesn't eliminate the fact that investors are paying a high premium for a company as it makes risky moves.\nTesla's shares currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 206, far above the tech sector's average P/E ratio of about 45.\n\nThis means Tesla's stock is already priced for perfection at a time of significant transition, falling profit, and increasing expenses. That's too risky for my liking, even if Tesla eventually achieves its goals. I think investors are better off not buying Tesla stock right now, at least waiting until the company can prove that it can reinvigorate sales and earnings from its electric vehicle business.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 4.4% in the afternoon session after the stock's positive momentum continued as reports revealed a significant Cybertruck purchase by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nThe electric vehicle maker's stock rebounded after it was revealed that SpaceX bought tens of millions of dollars' worth of Cybertrucks. This move was seen as a way to boost demand, as it was reported that demand for the truck had not yet met Tesla's planned production capacity. Adding to the positive news, Tesla's energy arm also made headlines. The company entered a three-year European agreement with French services provider SPIE SA to deliver battery energy storage system projects using its Megapack solutions.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $487.21, up 4.1% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Tesla? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 41 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 3.8% on the news that Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reiterated his $600 price target, declaring 2026 a pivotal \"monster year\" for the EV giant.\n\nIves argued that Tesla is \"taking major steps in advancing its AI Revolution path,\" with autonomy and robotics set to be the \"game changer\" that defines the company's future. Optimism was further strengthened by reports of driverless Model Y testing in Austin, validating the thesis that the robotaxi timeline is accelerating.\nTesla is up 28.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $487.21 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $489.88 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,103.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas.

      "Content": "Why Tesla Stock Popped Thursday\n\nRich Smith, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:28 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Tesla is reported to have sold 1,000 or even 2,000 Cybertrucks to SpaceX.\nMath suggests that Tesla has had trouble selling Cybertrucks to customers that Elon Musk does not own.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock jumped 4.5% through 1:45 p.m. ET Thursday on some apparently bad news -- that might turn out to be good news for Tesla stock, and for SpaceX stock, too ( once SpaceX IPOs ).\nAs EV news specialist Electrek reports, deep in the heart of Texas, Elon Musk's SpaceX is snapping up tens of millions of dollars' worth of Tesla Cybertrucks to work at its Starbase spaceport.\nHow is this bad news? Electrek explains: Tesla originally planned to build 250,000 Cybertrucks a year, ramping as high as 500,000 units per year if the demand justified it.\nBut demand didn't justify it.\nCrunching the numbers on Tesla's non-Model 3 and non-Model Y sales (Tesla groups S, X, and Cybertruck sales all together), Electrek calculates Tesla sold perhaps 20,000 Cybertrucks this year, turning Cybertruck into a gigantic \"commercial flop.\"\n\nExcept for one thing: SpaceX.\nSqueezing corporate lemons and turning them into lemonade, Musk's SpaceX rode to the rescue of Musk's Tesla, buying between 1,000 and 2,000 Cybertrucks for SpaceX's work fleet. At $80,000 per unit, that's $80 million to $160 million in revenue for Tesla.\nTurning bad news into good news Electrek sees this as bad news and a potential concern to investors in an upcoming SpaceX IPO. Viewed another way, though, if SpaceX needs trucks for its ground operations, why wouldn't it buy Cybertrucks from another Musk-owned company, if the alternative is giving money to a Musk competitor like Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) or General Motors (NYSE: GM) ?\n\nSeems to me, keeping the money in the family (so to speak) is actually a bright idea.\nAnd if it means Tesla now has a captive customer in SpaceX, which can help Tesla make its sales numbers when it needs to, that's probably a good thing for Tesla stock.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Elon Fever Hits Wall Street: Tesla Soars as SpaceX IPO Hype Builds\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:22 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nTesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) has returned to the center of investor attention as markets continue to price in Elon Musk's longer-term ambitions in artificial intelligence, robotics, and space, even as the company's core automotive business faces mounting pressure. The shares reached their first record high of the year on Tuesday and have climbed roughly 20% over the past four weeks, extending a sharp rebound of 111% from an April 8 low that coincided with heightened tariff-related market anxiety during President Donald Trump's administration. The move has placed Tesla among the top 20 performers in the S&P 500 Index, underscoring how sentiment around Musk's broader vision is currently outweighing concerns tied to near-term vehicle sales and profitability.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThat optimism has come with a notable expansion in valuation. Tesla is now trading at about 214 times forward earnings, making it the second-most expensive stock in the S&P 500, behind Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and ahead of Palantir Technologies Inc. Some investors argue the multiple is difficult to reconcile with slowing sales, declining profits, increased regulation, and more cautious consumer spending on cars, prompting a number of funds to reduce or exit positions. Others remain focused on Tesla's potential transformation into an AI and robotics company, highlighting Musk's stated goal of shifting the profit mix toward autonomous driving, robotaxis, and humanoid robots over time.\n\nLooking ahead, the possibility of a SpaceX public listing is adding another dimension to the Tesla debate. SpaceX is planning an insider share sale valuing the company at around $800 billion and could possibly pursue an initial public offering next year, which would create a new avenue for investors seeking exposure to Musk's ideas. Some market participants suggest this could lead to selling pressure in Tesla as capital rotates, while others believe a high-profile SpaceX listing could lift sentiment across Musk's ecosystem and support Tesla shares indirectly. For now, Tesla remains the only publicly traded vehicle for that vision, even as technical signals recently hinted the stock was approaching overbought levels, raising the prospect of a near-term pause following its latest surge.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO, Elon Musk , once again reignited the debate surrounding Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) co-founder, Bill Gates ‘ massive wealth, and what it could have been, had he not conformed to conventional wealth planning norms.\nBill Gates Could Have Been ‘World’s First Trillionaire’ On Wednesday, in a post on X, investor Michael Arouet highlighted the current top 10 richest people in the world, a list that no longer includes the Microsoft co-founder but does feature former CEO Steve Ballmer at No. 8, with an estimated net worth of $166 billion.\nThis comes after being ranked as the world’s wealthiest person by Forbes magazine for 18 of the 24 years between 1995 and 2017.\n\nDon't Miss:\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n$100k+ in investable assets?

(NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ) CEO, Warren Buffett , who asked him to diversify his holdings.\nAccording to Arouet, if Gates hadn’t listened to Buffett, he would now be “the world's first trillionaire, worth twice as much as Elon.”\nAs Microsoft shares continue to soar, and its market capitalization is now at $3.6 trillion, Gates’ net worth would have stood at a staggering $1.5 trillion if he had retained all of his shares in the company and hadn’t embarked on the massive philanthropic journey with his ex-wife, Melinda Gates .\nTo be fair, it's difficult to fault Buffett for that advice.

      "Content": "Tesla’s ‘Musk Premium’ in Focus With SpaceX IPO in View\n\nJordan Fitzgerald\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\n(Bloomberg) — Elon Musk is selling investors a future of driverless cars, robot assistants and life on Mars. The problem for investors is there’s only one way to buy into his vision: Tesla Inc.’s stock.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker’s shares were up nearly 3% on Thursday. They hit their first record of the year on Tuesday amid gains of more than 20% over the last four weeks. Since tumbling to a low on April 8 during the height of panic over the Trump administration’s tariffs, the stock has soared almost 120%, putting it among the 20 best performers in the S&P 500 Index.\n\nThe rally is a testament to Wall Street’s faith in Musk’s artificial intelligence ambitions, particularly since Tesla’s core auto business is struggling. But it has also made Tesla shares extremely expensive. At 214 times earnings over the next 12 months, the stock has the second highest valuation in the S&P 500, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and far ahead of number three, Palantir Technologies Inc., another high-flyer that trades at 178 times forward earnings as of Wednesday’s close.\n\n“The valuation doesn’t make any sense,” said Vikram Rai, portfolio manager and macro trader at First New York, which sold its Tesla position earlier this year after Musk and President Donald Trump had a very public fallout on social media.\nA Tesla representative didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nWith Musk’s SpaceX possibly going public next year, stock traders looking for “Elon exposure” will likely have another way to get it before long. The space exploration company is planning an insider share sale that would value it at $800 billion, making it the most expensive privately held business in the world. Its initial public offering would be the largest ever.\n\n“A SpaceX IPO could lead to some selling pressure on Tesla shares,” said Dmitry Shlyapnikov, an analyst at Horizon Investments who works with portfolio managers. “There are investors that own Tesla for exposure to Elon’s ideas and not for the car company attached to the ticker.”\nOf course, there’s another school of thought that a SpaceX public stock offering would shine a spotlight on Musk, giving Tesla another jolt of momentum.\n“Historically, when one of Musk’s companies achieves a major milestone, it tends to lift sentiment for the others,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. “A high-profile SpaceX IPO could attract a fresh wave of investors who are drawn to his innovation story — and that enthusiasm often spills over into Tesla.”\n\nStory Continues\nSo far, Tesla’s stock price is getting a boost from the hype surrounding SpaceX, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. The missions of the two companies are interlinked, he said, describing a future where Tesla’s Optimus robots help with Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, and SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system bolsters vehicle connectivity on Earth.\n\nThe companies also share lofty valuations. But Tesla skeptics question whether the company’s fundamentals can support those numbers. Its sales are slowing and profits are falling, while regulations rise and consumers spend less on cars.\n“If you’ve been long Tesla stock, you’ve made money, there’s no denying it,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, who has a small short position in Tesla. “It’s just bizarre to me because the fundamentals are so bad.”\n‘Double-Down on Elon’ Optimists, on the other hand, point to Tesla’s growth prospects with opportunities in autonomous driving and robotaxis. Musk’s goal is to transform Tesla from an auto manufacturer to an artificial intelligence and robotics company. He wrote in a September X post that 80% of the firm’s profits will eventually come from robots.\n\n“We believe Tesla’s earnings are going to be growing at 30% to 35% over the next two to three years based on the innovation that they have in the automotive segment,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns the company’s shares.\nIf Musk can pull that off, Tesla’s stock market valuation would make more sense. If he can’t, that’s where SpaceX comes in. Publicly traded shares of SpaceX would give investors the opportunity to own a piece of Musk’s vision without Tesla’s baggage.\n“I think most investors will not want to double-down on Elon,” First New York’s Rai said. “That is a lot of risk to carry.”\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce disagrees.\n“We don’t see investors making an either/or choice, but instead backing both companies,” he said. “Investors that have made money in Tesla are likely to want to back another Musk venture.”\n\nFor now, the reality for investors is Tesla is the only way to bet on Musk’s vision. The immediate risk is the stock’s valuation, which is getting close to dangerous territory. On a technical level, the shares had been close to being considered overbought earlier this week. When they last reached that level in early October, the stock fell 10% over the next seven sessions.\n“In the short term, it’s probably ready for a bit of a cooling off type of period after having that all-time high,” Mulberry said.\nBut to long-term Musk believers, the valuation may indeed be a short-term concern. Over the next few years, however, many see Tesla as a buy regardless of the price — possibly even more than SpaceX.\n“I fully believe that at some point there will be a commercial mission to Mars, but probably not in my lifetime,” said Mulberry, who is 51 years old. “Does that mean I want to invest in that stock today? You’d have to have a really long view of that, whereas you could see the impact of robotaxis and robots probably in the next three to five years.”\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nTop Tech News\nMicron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, a sign that surging demand and supply shortages are allowing the company to charge more for products.\nThe growing acrimony over the biggest deal in Hollywood is spilling into the open.

      "Content": "Kraken-Backed xStocks Launch on TON, Bringing Tokenized US Stocks to Telegram The tokens offer onchain price exposure without share ownership and are restricted by jurisdiction.\n\nAmin Ayan\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:14 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: KRAK.PVT\n\n^GSPC\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nKraken-backed xStocks have gone live on the TON blockchain, allowing users to access tokenized versions of US stocks and exchange-traded funds directly inside Telegram through its built-in TON Wallet.\nKey Takeaways:\nxStocks bring tokenized US stocks and ETFs directly into Telegram via TON Wallet.\nThe tokens offer onchain price exposure without share ownership and are restricted by jurisdiction.\nThe launch tests whether mass distribution can drive adoption of tokenized equities.\n\nThe move brings tokenized equities into one of the world’s largest messaging platforms, potentially expanding their reach beyond traditional crypto trading venues, according to a Thursday announcement.\nThrough the integration, users can buy, hold and transfer onchain representations of assets such as Tesla, Nvidia and the S&#038;P 500 ETF without leaving the Telegram app.\nxStocks Offer Onchain Price Exposure Without Direct Share Ownership xStocks are designed as fully collateralized products, backed one-to-one by underlying equities and ETFs held through regulated partners.\nThe tokens track the price of the underlying assets but do not confer direct ownership of the shares, offering users price exposure in an onchain format.\nThe service is not available to US users and is restricted to jurisdictions where the tokens can be legally offered.\n\nxStocks has not registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, meaning distribution relies on jurisdictional controls.\nTokenized equities are not new, but previous attempts struggled to gain traction. Liquidity constraints, regulatory uncertainty and limited distribution often confined earlier offerings to niche crypto platforms.\nBy embedding tokenized stocks inside a mainstream messaging app, Kraken and its partners appear to be testing whether access and ease of use can unlock broader adoption.\nThe TON Foundation framed the launch as a step toward bringing real-world assets into everyday digital activity.\nTON Foundation president and CEO Max Crown said the integration allows users to hold and trade tokenized U.S. equities “with the same ease as sending a message,” while maintaining self-custody through TON Wallet.\n\nFor Telegram’s wallet ecosystem, the move builds on earlier experiments. Wallet in Telegram previously launched custodial access to stocks and ETFs through its Crypto Wallet product, which saw early demand despite limited geographic availability.\nTelegram claims more than 900 million global users, while TON Wallet reports close to 100 million users, giving xStocks immediate exposure to a large consumer base.\n\nStory Continues\nRWA Tokenization Gains Momentum Earlier this month, Libeara, the blockchain infrastructure platform backed by Standard Chartered’s venture arm SC Ventures, rolled out a new tokenized gold investment fund in Singapore, bringing one of the world’s oldest safe-haven assets onto digital rails.\nThe fund, launched in partnership with FundBridge Capital, allows professional investors to gain exposure to gold through blockchain-based tokens issued on Libeara’s ledger.\n\nIn a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market.\nAnimoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth.\n“The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote.\nMeanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 .\nRead original story Kraken-Backed xStocks Launch on TON, Bringing Tokenized US Stocks to Telegram by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Cathie Wood Jumping Ship on Tesla Stock?\n\nEbube Jones\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:11 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nCathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Invest, does not usually back away from her highest‑conviction ideas, which is exactly why her steady selling of Tesla (TSLA) shares has everyone’s attention. Ark Invest has been trimming Tesla even as the stock trades near $475 and has a record free cash flow of nearly $4 billion.\n\nEarlier in the year, the tone was very different as Ark leaned into weakness rather than backing away from the story. When Tesla sold off after its Q2 2025 earnings report, Ark stepped in and bought the post-earnings dip, scooping up 143,190 TSLA shares across three flagship exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock. Should You?\nBroadcom Stock Is Up 120% in the Past Year. This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\nJPMorgan Says the Dip in Broadcom Stock Is a Screaming Buy. Are You Loading Up on Shares Now?\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nThat makes today’s selling harder to ignore for anyone trying to read the next chapter in the TSLA story. So the real question for investors is simple. If one of Tesla’s most famous long-term bulls is taking chips off the table at these prices, should you be following her out the door, leaning into the story, or doing something in between? Let’s dive in.\nTesla’s Rally Runs Into Margins Tesla is an American electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy manufacturer headquartered in Austin, Texas, focused on EVs, batteries, and software-driven mobility solutions.\nTesla currently trades around $467, with a year-to-date gain of 15.7%.\n​It now carries a market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion, supported by a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 337.85x versus a sector median of 16.58x and a forward P/E of 415.72x against 17.76x. This valuation backdrop helps explain why even long-time bulls may feel compelled to trim holdings.​\n\nTesla’s latest earnings report for the third quarter underscores that tension between lofty expectations and mixed fundamentals. TSLA delivered earnings per share (EPS) of $0.37, missing the $0.41 consensus by $0.04 and posting a negative surprise of 9.76%. This result came despite revenue of $28.10 billion, which exceeded estimates of $26.37 billion and showed that demand remains robust at the top line.​\nTSLA’s profitability metrics paint a more cautious picture. Tesla’s operating expenses jumped 50% year-over-year to $3.43 billion as spending ramped on robotaxis and Optimus, driving operating margins down to 5.8% from 10.8%. This left gross profit up just 1% on 12% revenue growth, showing how much investment is pressuring near-term earnings power. Tesla still generated $4.8 billion in free cash flow, a record that dwarfs the prior quarter’s $146 million.\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Tesla’s Story Still Sells Tesla recently locked in a supply agreement with Samsung SDI, valued at roughly $2.1 billion over three years. The agreement will help Tesla secure battery cells for its energy storage systems, including Megapack and Powerwall products. This deal directly addresses the company's production constraints in energy storage, a segment that contributed 12% of total revenue in Q3.\n\nBeyond batteries, robotaxis remain the headline-grabbing catalyst. Elon Musk announced plans to remove safety drivers from Austin robotaxis within three weeks. He also teased a next-generation Full Self-Driving model that is “an order of magnitude bigger,” with a possible launch window in January or February 2026.\nTesla is even hiring robotaxi operators in New York City, which hints at ambitions to push into one of the toughest urban driving environments. The catch is that regulatory approval remains uncertain, full autonomy at scale is still years away, and competitors like Waymo already have more than 100 million miles logged without safety drivers.\nMeanwhile, another narrative is the idea of Tesla growing into an $8.5 trillion company, tied to a proposed $1 trillion CEO pay package. This is exactly the setup that can prompt Ark Invest to sell shares into strength, because the stock becomes increasingly driven by milestones and sentiment.\n\nWall Street’s TSLA Reality Check The next earnings release is slated for February, which could either validate the narrative or fuel more trimming. For the current quarter, the average EPS estimate is $0.35 versus $0.66 in the prior year.\nLooking one quarter out, the average EPS estimate is $0.34, compared with $0.15 last year. In other words, expectations call for a rebound, but from a depressed base.​\nConsensus positioning stays cautious, with the consensus rating on Tesla currently a “Hold.” The average 12‑month price target comes in at $385.41, which implies roughly 19% downside from its current price.\nIn Conclusion Cathie Wood is not bailing on Tesla so much as dialing back risk after a massive rerating, and that nuance matters for anyone watching her trades. Given stretched valuations, choppy near-term earnings, and neutral analyst targets, TSLA looks more likely to cool off or move sideways than rip higher from here in a straight line. Over a multi-year window, the odds still favor higher prices if robotaxis and energy storage deliver, but sizing and patience will matter.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) is among the 8 High Growth EV Stocks to Buy Now.\nAccording to a research note by Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard, President Trump’s support of a U.S. manufacturing program for inexpensive “tiny cars” might help businesses like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ouster Inc., and Serve Robotics, as reported by The Fly on December 8, 2025.\nAccording to Sheppard, the program includes vehicles with internal combustion engines and electric models that cost between $8,000 and $13,000. Production will adhere to Department of Transportation safety regulations and testing. The analyst added that the Trump administration is thinking of issuing an executive order to support the domestic robotics industry. This might accelerate the use of humanoids and autonomous delivery robots in the United States, the analyst added.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported on December 11, 2025, that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s U.S. sales plummeted to a near three-year low in November, even with the automaker’s introduction of new, lower-cost models of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 compact sedan. Total U.S. sales fell by about 23% to 39,800 vehicles in November from 51,513 vehicles a year earlier, the lowest since January 2022, according to data from Cox Automotive.\nStephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, stated that demand for the less expensive “Standard” versions seemed to reduce sales of premium models rather than increase overall sales.\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a vertically integrated battery-electric vehicle manufacturer and developer of real-world artificial intelligence software, such as self-driving cars and humanoid robots.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Where Will Tesla Be in 1 Year?\n\nLee Samaha, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Tesla's production ramp, including Cybercabs, must be supported by regulatory approvals.\nThe company is likely to have a stronger second half in 2026 than its first.\nThis could be the year that Tesla finally delivers on its unsupervised full self-driving and robotaxi aims.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nTesla 's (NASDAQ: TSLA) management described 2025 as the \"year of the Y,\" but what will define 2026?\nOne way to describe it could be a year when the chips went all in. The roadmap was set during the third-quarter earnings call, and Tesla is betting big on full self-driving (FSD) and robotaxis. That said, it's likely to be a second-half-weighted year for the company, so investors need to be patient through the year. Here's why.\nA tale of two halves Tesla will release its fourth-quarter earnings in early 2026, and they are likely to show a sequential decline in electric vehicle ( EV ) deliveries, which could extend into the second quarter. The reason comes down to the pull-forward in deliveries in the U.S. third quarter, driven by the expiration of the federal EV tax credit at the end of September. That will undoubtedly lead to slowing sales in the fourth quarter.\nAs such, don't be surprised if Tesla's overall sales decline sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026. Indeed, the Wall Street analyst consensus is just such an event, before returning to sequential and year-on-year growth from the second quarter onwards.\nFurthermore, CFO Vaibhav Taneja has already informed investors that Tesla plans to increase capital spending \"increase substantially\" in 2026, from approximately $9 billion in 2025. The expenditures to support ramping up EV production (more on that shortly) and to invest in Tesla's AI initiatives, including the Optimus robot. For reference, CEO Elon Musk aims to have the third generation of the Optimus robot in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nTesla's big ramp-up in 2026 Musk couldn't have been any clearer on the earnings call in October, due to \"clarity on achieving full self-driving, unsupervised full self-driving, I should say, I feel confident in expanding Tesla's production. So that is our intent to expand as quickly as we can our future production.\"\nMusk went on to reiterate the determination to ramp production and said that the dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab, would be the \"single biggest expansion in production\" and start in the second quarter of 2026.\nTesla's big bet The production and capital spending ramp up, not to mention the focus on Cybercabs, speaks to Musk's confidence in the ongoing development of Tesla's robotaxi rollout and its unsupervised FSD. Musk recently affirmed via a post on X that robotaxi testing (without any occupant in the car) is underway in Austin, Texas. That would be somewhat in accordance with Musk's aim of having \"no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year.\"\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Tesla is hoping that the Netherlands vehicle authority (RDW) will approve its FSD in February 2026, an act that could open up a pathway to EUwide approval or, failing that, country-level approvals in Europe.\nThat would be a significant plus for opening new markets for Tesla's FSD software sales and laying the groundwork for the potential deployment of Tesla's robotaxis in Europe. It could also boost Tesla's EV sales, as FSD is a key differentiator for the company's EVs.\nWhere will Tesla be at the end of 2026? If all goes to plan, Tesla will continue to expand its robotaxi coverage, having achieved approval for unsupervised robotaxis (a feature a Cybercab requires, as Musk's initial conception is for them not to have steering wheels and pedals), and growth in EV sales from the second quarter onward.\nAs such, it could end the year with the robotaxi rollout in strong growth mode, backed by Cybercab deployment and FSD growth in Europe. In addition, Tesla's EV sales could receive a boost, with more releases of stripped-down versions of its Y and 3 models.\n\nAlternatively, the production ramp and capital spending ramp up may prove misplaced if Tesla doesn't achieve unsupervised robotaxi and FSD approvals (Europe) in a timely fashion. Risk is rising, but so is the potential reward.\nWhichever way, next year is the year of the all-in bet on FSD. Hopefully, Tesla and the regulatory bodies will deliver.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Rivian CEO on self-driving, designing AI chips, and why Tesla needs more competition\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:02 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAt Rivian's ( RIVN ) Autonomy and AI Day on Dec. 11, the pure-play EV maker outlined a whole range of tech and software products, with a focus on vertical integration — meaning doing everything from end to end in-house.\nCEO RJ Scaringe launched the company's new Autonomy platform at the event — and during a trying time for the EV sector, in which so far only Tesla has achieved profitability. While Rivian has achieved gross profits in recent quarters, actual bottom-line (or net) profits have been elusive.\n\nScaringe, who founded the company in 2011, saw Rivian go public in 2021 and reach stratospheric heights of $120 a share before the stock came back down to earth, now at $18. A crucial cash infusion from Volkswagen ( VWAGY ) of nearly $6 billion via a joint venture between the two companies has given Rivian much-needed breathing room.\nThe following is a condensed version of Yahoo Finance's conversation with Scaringe, touching on the company's path toward full self-driving (FSD), or personal L4, as Rivian calls it, building in-house chips, and where the overall EV industry is headed.\nYahoo Finance: Thanks for having us here, RJ. Rivian's Autonomy platform — talk to me about the progression from where Rivian is right now to what's going to come out in the near term and its vision for the future.\nRJ Scaringe: Autonomy has been a journey for us. We followed the launch of our Gen 1 vehicles at the end of 2021. In early 2022, we realized we wanted to do a clean-sheet approach to our Autonomy platform. So we started the process on that, and that involved developing a camera platform, redesigning the compute platform, and architecting the whole system around an AI-centric approach.\n\nThat was what went into our [current] Gen 2 vehicles that we ultimately launched in the middle of 2024, and the compute relative to our Gen 1 [vehicles] increased by about 10x — that's the inference on the vehicle. When we launched that, there was 55 megapixels of cameras, an array of radars, and that began the process of building the data stream to really train this model.\nOn our Gen 3 platform, it's [built using] an in-house chip ... This is a platform that can process 5 billion pixels per second, so that's roughly 5x the best in class today. This is very, very high processing capability. And that not only raises the performance level of this platform, but it also allows us to build the model more efficiently and more quickly.\nCurrently, Rivian offers Universal Hands-Free, which is akin to GM's Supercruise, and that will be expanded to more roads. What comes next?\nIn 2026, we'll add \"point to point.\" So you can get in the car from your driveway, type the address, and it does everything, hands-free, eyes-on, etc. ... But it's still supervised.\n\nStory Continues\nThen the platform expands to the next big step, which is eyes-off — and eyes-off is really powerful. That's when you can start to be in the car, be on your phone, be reading a book. Essentially, your role in driving the car diminishes to nothing. You're just a passenger.\nAnd then the next step beyond that is what we call personal Level 4, which is the idea that the vehicle can completely operate on its own, even without anybody in the car. And so things like picking the kids up from school, an airport drop-off, or grabbing groceries.",

If the acquisition goes through, Waymo's value would be close to $100 billion, which is one of the biggest in the new robotaxi market.People who know about the negotiations said that the new money is meant to help Waymo keep rolling out autonomous ride services, which have been growing into additional U.S. cities over the last year. The business has been getting bigger fleets, better technology, and collaborating with local governments to make sure that safety and operating standards are followed.Alphabet's action shows that they still believe in the long-term future of self-driving cars, even while other companies like Tesla, Uber, and Lyft are still working on their own driver-assistance and ride-hailing plans. Waymo has made success recently, which implies that there is a growing demand for services that don't need a driver. More money might help speed up that move.Investors will be looking to see whether Waymo can close the transaction and utilize the extra money to accelerate up its ambitions to grow in 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla’s ‘Musk Premium’ in Focus With SpaceX IPO on the Horizon\n\nJordan Fitzgerald\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk is selling investors a future of driverless cars, robot assistants and life on Mars. The problem is there’s only one way to buy into his vision: Tesla Inc.’s stock.\nThe electric-vehicle maker’s shares, which hit their first record of the year on Tuesday, are up roughly 20% in the last four weeks. Since tumbling to a low on April 8 during the height of panic over the Trump administration’s tariffs, the stock has soared 111%, putting it among the 20 best performers in the S&P 500 Index.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\nThe rally is a testament to Wall Street’s faith in Musk’s artificial intelligence ambitions, particularly since Tesla’s core auto business is struggling. But it has also made Tesla shares extremely expensive. At 214 times earnings over the next 12 months, the stock has the second highest valuation in the S&P 500, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and far ahead of number three Palantir Technologies Inc., another high-flyer that trades at 178 times forward earnings.\n\n“The valuation doesn’t make any sense,” said Vikram Rai, portfolio manager and macro trader at First New York, which sold its Tesla position earlier this year after Musk and President Donald Trump had a very public fallout over social media.\nA Tesla representative didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nWith Musk’s SpaceX possibly going public next year, stock traders looking for “Elon exposure” will likely have another way to get it before long. The space exploration company is planning an insider share sale that would value it at $800 billion, making it the most expensive privately held business in the world. Its initial public offering would be the largest ever.\n\n“A SpaceX IPO could lead to some selling pressure on Tesla shares,” said Dmitry Shlyapnikov, an analyst at Horizon Investments who works with portfolio managers. “There are investors that own Tesla for exposure to Elon’s ideas and not for the car company attached to the ticker.”\nOf course, there’s another school of thought that a SpaceX public stock offering would shine a spotlight on Musk, giving Tesla another jolt of momentum.\n“Historically, when one of Musk’s companies achieves a major milestone, it tends to lift sentiment for the others,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. “A high-profile SpaceX IPO could attract a fresh wave of investors who are drawn to his innovation story — and that enthusiasm often spills over into Tesla.”\n\nStory Continues\nSo far, Tesla’s stock price is getting a boost from the hype surrounding SpaceX, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. The missions of the two companies are interlinked, he said, describing a future where Tesla’s Optimus robots help with Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, and SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system bolsters vehicle connectivity on earth.\n\nThe companies also share lofty valuations. But Tesla skeptics question whether the company’s fundamentals can support those numbers. Its sales are slowing and profits are falling, while regulations rise and consumers spend less on cars.\n“If you’ve been long Tesla stock, you’ve made money, there’s no denying it,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, who has a small short position in Tesla. “It’s just bizarre to me because the fundamentals are so bad.”\n‘Double-Down on Elon’\nOptimists, on the other hand, point to Tesla’s growth prospects with opportunities in autonomous driving and robotaxis. Musk’s goal is to transform Tesla from an auto manufacturer to an artificial intelligence and robotics company, writing in a September X post that 80% of the firm’s profits will eventually come from robots.\n\n“We believe Tesla’s earnings are going to be growing at 30% to 35% over the next two to three years based on the innovation that they have in the automotive segment,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns the company’s shares.\nIf Musk can pull that off, Tesla’s stock market valuation would make more sense. If he can’t, that’s where SpaceX comes in. Publicly traded shares of SpaceX would give investors the opportunity to own a piece of Musk’s vision without Tesla’s baggage.\n“I think most investors will not want to double-down on Elon,” First New York’s Rai said. “That is a lot of risk to carry.”\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce disagrees.\n“We don’t see investors making an either/or choice, but instead backing both companies,” he said. “Investors that have made money in Tesla are likely to want to back another Musk venture.”\n\nFor now, the reality for investors is Tesla is the only one way to bet on Musk’s vision. The immediate risk is the stock’s valuation, which is getting close to dangerous territory. On a technical level, the shares had been close to being considered overbought earlier this week. When they last reached that level in early October, the stock fell 10% over the next seven sessions.\n“In the short term, it’s probably ready for a bit of a cooling off type of period after having that all-time high,” Mulberry said.\nBut to long-term Musk believers, the valuation is what Mulberry described, a short-term concern. Over the next few years, however, many see Tesla as a buy regardless of the price — possibly even more than SpaceX.\n“I fully believe that at some point there will be a commercial mission to Mars, but probably not in my lifetime,” said Mulberry, who’s 51 years old. “Does that mean I want to invest in that stock today? You’d have to have a really long view of that, whereas you could see the impact of robotaxis and robots probably in the next three to five years.”\n\nTop Tech News\nMicron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, a sign that surging demand and supply shortages are allowing the company to charge more for products.\nThe growing acrimony over the biggest deal in Hollywood is spilling into the open.

      "Content": "Rivian CEO says midprice EV sales are still 50% Tesla: ‘That’s not a reflection of a healthy market’\n\nSasha Rogelberg\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nIt’s not that Americans don’t want electric vehicles, according to the chief executive of American EV-maker Rivian. It’s just that they don’t have many good options.\nAt the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco earlier this month, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe pointed to the scant choices consumers have in picking a midprice EV, noting that Tesla has continued to dominate sales, making up about 50% of the market share, with few other competitors making an impression.\n\n“That&#8217;s not a reflection of a healthy market with lots of choice,” Scaringe said. “If you think of it as a consumer, you have 300 different internal combustion engine choices at that price or lower, and you have maybe one highly compelling EV choice.”\nEV demand in the U.S. has continued to lag behind other parts of the world, making up just about 5% of new car sales, according to November data from Edmunds. In China, meanwhile, EVs make up more than 50% of the auto market share, China Association of Automobile Manufacturers data shows. Battery-electric cars make up about 16% of the EU market share, per the European Automobile Manufacturers&#8217; Association.\nU.S. automakers are feeling the squeeze from middling demand, with Ford pivoting away from heavy EV investment, citing lackluster American interest. It announced this week it would take a $19.5 billion charge and refocus on gas- and hybrid-powered vehicles, discontinuing some larger EV models.\n\nSparking American’s EV curiosity Scaringe hopes his automaker’s own focus on more affordable EVs can rev up demand in the sector. Rivian’s R1, a seven-seat premium SUV, starts at about $70,000 and can run up to about $120,000. The R2, expected to launch in the first half of next year, will have a $45,000 price tag.\n“We see, with R2, an opportunity to really bring a whole host of new customers that haven&#8217;t had a choice that&#8217;s electric that really appealed to them yet,” Scaringe said.\n\nPrice appears to be at the forefront of the CEO’s mind. While automakers like Ford said the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit tempered demand for new cars, Scaringe reportedly took a different perspective . In a memo to employees, reported by the Wall Street Journal , Scaringe said the end of the incentive puts pressure on EV companies, including Rivian, to lower prices.\nBut increased competition has not always been greeted so fondly. Canada imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs in 2024, hoping to protect the burgeoning domestic market of electric cars. Scaringe, however, sees room for his rivals in the U.S.\n\nStory Continues\n“I really think the constraint isn&#8217;t the demand side. I think it&#8217;s the supply side,” Scaringe said. “I do think that the existence of choice will help drive more penetration, and it actually creates a unique opportunity in the United States.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
