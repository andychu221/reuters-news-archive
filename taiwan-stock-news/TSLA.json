(NASDAQ: TSLA ) is among the 8 High Growth EV Stocks to Buy Now.\nAccording to a research note by Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard, President Trump’s support of a U.S. manufacturing program for inexpensive “tiny cars” might help businesses like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ouster Inc., and Serve Robotics, as reported by The Fly on December 8, 2025.\nAccording to Sheppard, the program includes vehicles with internal combustion engines and electric models that cost between $8,000 and $13,000. Production will adhere to Department of Transportation safety regulations and testing. The analyst added that the Trump administration is thinking of issuing an executive order to support the domestic robotics industry. This might accelerate the use of humanoids and autonomous delivery robots in the United States, the analyst added.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported on December 11, 2025, that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s U.S. sales plummeted to a near three-year low in November, even with the automaker’s introduction of new, lower-cost models of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 compact sedan. Total U.S. sales fell by about 23% to 39,800 vehicles in November from 51,513 vehicles a year earlier, the lowest since January 2022, according to data from Cox Automotive.\nStephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, stated that demand for the less expensive “Standard” versions seemed to reduce sales of premium models rather than increase overall sales.\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a vertically integrated battery-electric vehicle manufacturer and developer of real-world artificial intelligence software, such as self-driving cars and humanoid robots.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The roadmap was set during the third-quarter earnings call, and Tesla is betting big on full self-driving (FSD) and robotaxis. That said, it's likely to be a second-half-weighted year for the company, so investors need to be patient through the year. Here's why.\nA tale of two halves Tesla will release its fourth-quarter earnings in early 2026, and they are likely to show a sequential decline in electric vehicle ( EV ) deliveries, which could extend into the second quarter. The reason comes down to the pull-forward in deliveries in the U.S. third quarter, driven by the expiration of the federal EV tax credit at the end of September. That will undoubtedly lead to slowing sales in the fourth quarter.\nAs such, don't be surprised if Tesla's overall sales decline sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026. Indeed, the Wall Street analyst consensus is just such an event, before returning to sequential and year-on-year growth from the second quarter onwards.\nFurthermore, CFO Vaibhav Taneja has already informed investors that Tesla plans to increase capital spending \"increase substantially\" in 2026, from approximately $9 billion in 2025. The expenditures to support ramping up EV production (more on that shortly) and to invest in Tesla's AI initiatives, including the Optimus robot. For reference, CEO Elon Musk aims to have the third generation of the Optimus robot in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nTesla's big ramp-up in 2026 Musk couldn't have been any clearer on the earnings call in October, due to \"clarity on achieving full self-driving, unsupervised full self-driving, I should say, I feel confident in expanding Tesla's production. So that is our intent to expand as quickly as we can our future production.\"\nMusk went on to reiterate the determination to ramp production and said that the dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab, would be the \"single biggest expansion in production\" and start in the second quarter of 2026.\nTesla's big bet The production and capital spending ramp up, not to mention the focus on Cybercabs, speaks to Musk's confidence in the ongoing development of Tesla's robotaxi rollout and its unsupervised FSD. Musk recently affirmed via a post on X that robotaxi testing (without any occupant in the car) is underway in Austin, Texas. That would be somewhat in accordance with Musk's aim of having \"no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year.\"\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Tesla is hoping that the Netherlands vehicle authority (RDW) will approve its FSD in February 2026, an act that could open up a pathway to EUwide approval or, failing that, country-level approvals in Europe.\nThat would be a significant plus for opening new markets for Tesla's FSD software sales and laying the groundwork for the potential deployment of Tesla's robotaxis in Europe. It could also boost Tesla's EV sales, as FSD is a key differentiator for the company's EVs.\nWhere will Tesla be at the end of 2026? If all goes to plan, Tesla will continue to expand its robotaxi coverage, having achieved approval for unsupervised robotaxis (a feature a Cybercab requires, as Musk's initial conception is for them not to have steering wheels and pedals), and growth in EV sales from the second quarter onward.\nAs such, it could end the year with the robotaxi rollout in strong growth mode, backed by Cybercab deployment and FSD growth in Europe. In addition, Tesla's EV sales could receive a boost, with more releases of stripped-down versions of its Y and 3 models.\n\nAlternatively, the production ramp and capital spending ramp up may prove misplaced if Tesla doesn't achieve unsupervised robotaxi and FSD approvals (Europe) in a timely fashion. Risk is rising, but so is the potential reward.\nWhichever way, next year is the year of the all-in bet on FSD. Hopefully, Tesla and the regulatory bodies will deliver.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Rivian CEO on self-driving, designing AI chips, and why Tesla needs more competition\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:02 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAt Rivian's ( RIVN ) Autonomy and AI Day on Dec. 11, the pure-play EV maker outlined a whole range of tech and software products, with a focus on vertical integration — meaning doing everything from end to end in-house.\nCEO RJ Scaringe launched the company's new Autonomy platform at the event — and during a trying time for the EV sector, in which so far only Tesla has achieved profitability. While Rivian has achieved gross profits in recent quarters, actual bottom-line (or net) profits have been elusive.\n\nScaringe, who founded the company in 2011, saw Rivian go public in 2021 and reach stratospheric heights of $120 a share before the stock came back down to earth, now at $18. A crucial cash infusion from Volkswagen ( VWAGY ) of nearly $6 billion via a joint venture between the two companies has given Rivian much-needed breathing room.\nThe following is a condensed version of Yahoo Finance's conversation with Scaringe, touching on the company's path toward full self-driving (FSD), or personal L4, as Rivian calls it, building in-house chips, and where the overall EV industry is headed.\nYahoo Finance: Thanks for having us here, RJ. Rivian's Autonomy platform — talk to me about the progression from where Rivian is right now to what's going to come out in the near term and its vision for the future.\nRJ Scaringe: Autonomy has been a journey for us. We followed the launch of our Gen 1 vehicles at the end of 2021. In early 2022, we realized we wanted to do a clean-sheet approach to our Autonomy platform. So we started the process on that, and that involved developing a camera platform, redesigning the compute platform, and architecting the whole system around an AI-centric approach.\n\nThat was what went into our [current] Gen 2 vehicles that we ultimately launched in the middle of 2024, and the compute relative to our Gen 1 [vehicles] increased by about 10x — that's the inference on the vehicle. When we launched that, there was 55 megapixels of cameras, an array of radars, and that began the process of building the data stream to really train this model.\nOn our Gen 3 platform, it's [built using] an in-house chip ... This is a platform that can process 5 billion pixels per second, so that's roughly 5x the best in class today. This is very, very high processing capability. And that not only raises the performance level of this platform, but it also allows us to build the model more efficiently and more quickly.\nCurrently, Rivian offers Universal Hands-Free, which is akin to GM's Supercruise, and that will be expanded to more roads. What comes next?\nIn 2026, we'll add \"point to point.\" So you can get in the car from your driveway, type the address, and it does everything, hands-free, eyes-on, etc. ... But it's still supervised.\n\nStory Continues\nThen the platform expands to the next big step, which is eyes-off — and eyes-off is really powerful. That's when you can start to be in the car, be on your phone, be reading a book. Essentially, your role in driving the car diminishes to nothing. You're just a passenger.\nAnd then the next step beyond that is what we call personal Level 4, which is the idea that the vehicle can completely operate on its own, even without anybody in the car. And so things like picking the kids up from school, an airport drop-off, or grabbing groceries.",

If the acquisition goes through, Waymo's value would be close to $100 billion, which is one of the biggest in the new robotaxi market.People who know about the negotiations said that the new money is meant to help Waymo keep rolling out autonomous ride services, which have been growing into additional U.S. cities over the last year. The business has been getting bigger fleets, better technology, and collaborating with local governments to make sure that safety and operating standards are followed.Alphabet's action shows that they still believe in the long-term future of self-driving cars, even while other companies like Tesla, Uber, and Lyft are still working on their own driver-assistance and ride-hailing plans. Waymo has made success recently, which implies that there is a growing demand for services that don't need a driver. More money might help speed up that move.Investors will be looking to see whether Waymo can close the transaction and utilize the extra money to accelerate up its ambitions to grow in 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla’s ‘Musk Premium’ in Focus With SpaceX IPO on the Horizon\n\nJordan Fitzgerald\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk is selling investors a future of driverless cars, robot assistants and life on Mars. The problem is there’s only one way to buy into his vision: Tesla Inc.’s stock.\nThe electric-vehicle maker’s shares, which hit their first record of the year on Tuesday, are up roughly 20% in the last four weeks. Since tumbling to a low on April 8 during the height of panic over the Trump administration’s tariffs, the stock has soared 111%, putting it among the 20 best performers in the S&P 500 Index.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\nThe rally is a testament to Wall Street’s faith in Musk’s artificial intelligence ambitions, particularly since Tesla’s core auto business is struggling. But it has also made Tesla shares extremely expensive. At 214 times earnings over the next 12 months, the stock has the second highest valuation in the S&P 500, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and far ahead of number three Palantir Technologies Inc., another high-flyer that trades at 178 times forward earnings.\n\n“The valuation doesn’t make any sense,” said Vikram Rai, portfolio manager and macro trader at First New York, which sold its Tesla position earlier this year after Musk and President Donald Trump had a very public fallout over social media.\nA Tesla representative didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nWith Musk’s SpaceX possibly going public next year, stock traders looking for “Elon exposure” will likely have another way to get it before long. The space exploration company is planning an insider share sale that would value it at $800 billion, making it the most expensive privately held business in the world. Its initial public offering would be the largest ever.\n\n“A SpaceX IPO could lead to some selling pressure on Tesla shares,” said Dmitry Shlyapnikov, an analyst at Horizon Investments who works with portfolio managers. “There are investors that own Tesla for exposure to Elon’s ideas and not for the car company attached to the ticker.”\nOf course, there’s another school of thought that a SpaceX public stock offering would shine a spotlight on Musk, giving Tesla another jolt of momentum.\n“Historically, when one of Musk’s companies achieves a major milestone, it tends to lift sentiment for the others,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. “A high-profile SpaceX IPO could attract a fresh wave of investors who are drawn to his innovation story — and that enthusiasm often spills over into Tesla.”\n\nStory Continues\nSo far, Tesla’s stock price is getting a boost from the hype surrounding SpaceX, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. The missions of the two companies are interlinked, he said, describing a future where Tesla’s Optimus robots help with Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, and SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system bolsters vehicle connectivity on earth.\n\nThe companies also share lofty valuations. But Tesla skeptics question whether the company’s fundamentals can support those numbers. Its sales are slowing and profits are falling, while regulations rise and consumers spend less on cars.\n“If you’ve been long Tesla stock, you’ve made money, there’s no denying it,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, who has a small short position in Tesla. “It’s just bizarre to me because the fundamentals are so bad.”\n‘Double-Down on Elon’\nOptimists, on the other hand, point to Tesla’s growth prospects with opportunities in autonomous driving and robotaxis. Musk’s goal is to transform Tesla from an auto manufacturer to an artificial intelligence and robotics company, writing in a September X post that 80% of the firm’s profits will eventually come from robots.\n\n“We believe Tesla’s earnings are going to be growing at 30% to 35% over the next two to three years based on the innovation that they have in the automotive segment,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns the company’s shares.\nIf Musk can pull that off, Tesla’s stock market valuation would make more sense. If he can’t, that’s where SpaceX comes in. Publicly traded shares of SpaceX would give investors the opportunity to own a piece of Musk’s vision without Tesla’s baggage.\n“I think most investors will not want to double-down on Elon,” First New York’s Rai said. “That is a lot of risk to carry.”\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce disagrees.\n“We don’t see investors making an either/or choice, but instead backing both companies,” he said. “Investors that have made money in Tesla are likely to want to back another Musk venture.”\n\nFor now, the reality for investors is Tesla is the only one way to bet on Musk’s vision. The immediate risk is the stock’s valuation, which is getting close to dangerous territory. On a technical level, the shares had been close to being considered overbought earlier this week. When they last reached that level in early October, the stock fell 10% over the next seven sessions.\n“In the short term, it’s probably ready for a bit of a cooling off type of period after having that all-time high,” Mulberry said.\nBut to long-term Musk believers, the valuation is what Mulberry described, a short-term concern. Over the next few years, however, many see Tesla as a buy regardless of the price — possibly even more than SpaceX.\n“I fully believe that at some point there will be a commercial mission to Mars, but probably not in my lifetime,” said Mulberry, who’s 51 years old. “Does that mean I want to invest in that stock today? You’d have to have a really long view of that, whereas you could see the impact of robotaxis and robots probably in the next three to five years.”\n\nTop Tech News\nMicron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, a sign that surging demand and supply shortages are allowing the company to charge more for products.\nThe growing acrimony over the biggest deal in Hollywood is spilling into the open. On Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., the parent of HBO and CNN, advised its shareholders to reject a hostile takeover bid by Paramount Skydance Corp. in favor of its original agreement with streaming giant Netflix Inc.\nOpenAI and Anthropic are looking to expand their office footprints in Dublin, a move that underscores both firms’ growing presence in Europe and the race to boost global uptake of their artificial intelligence services.\nApple Inc. is making changes to its iOS software in Japan to comply with a new local law aimed at fostering competition, part of broader efforts by the iPhone maker to adapt to regulations around the world.\nThe Academy Awards will move to Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube service in 2029, ending more than a half century on the ABC network and more than 70 years on broadcast TV.\nEarnings Due Thursday\nNo major earnings expected\n--With assistance from Matt Turner and David Watkins.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\nThe Prosperity Gap Between Big and Small Businesses\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Rivian CEO says midprice EV sales are still 50% Tesla: ‘That’s not a reflection of a healthy market’\n\nSasha Rogelberg\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nIt’s not that Americans don’t want electric vehicles, according to the chief executive of American EV-maker Rivian. It’s just that they don’t have many good options.\nAt the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco earlier this month, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe pointed to the scant choices consumers have in picking a midprice EV, noting that Tesla has continued to dominate sales, making up about 50% of the market share, with few other competitors making an impression.\n\n“That&#8217;s not a reflection of a healthy market with lots of choice,” Scaringe said. “If you think of it as a consumer, you have 300 different internal combustion engine choices at that price or lower, and you have maybe one highly compelling EV choice.”\nEV demand in the U.S. has continued to lag behind other parts of the world, making up just about 5% of new car sales, according to November data from Edmunds. In China, meanwhile, EVs make up more than 50% of the auto market share, China Association of Automobile Manufacturers data shows. Battery-electric cars make up about 16% of the EU market share, per the European Automobile Manufacturers&#8217; Association.\nU.S. automakers are feeling the squeeze from middling demand, with Ford pivoting away from heavy EV investment, citing lackluster American interest. It announced this week it would take a $19.5 billion charge and refocus on gas- and hybrid-powered vehicles, discontinuing some larger EV models.\n\nSparking American’s EV curiosity Scaringe hopes his automaker’s own focus on more affordable EVs can rev up demand in the sector. Rivian’s R1, a seven-seat premium SUV, starts at about $70,000 and can run up to about $120,000. The R2, expected to launch in the first half of next year, will have a $45,000 price tag.\n“We see, with R2, an opportunity to really bring a whole host of new customers that haven&#8217;t had a choice that&#8217;s electric that really appealed to them yet,” Scaringe said.\n\nPrice appears to be at the forefront of the CEO’s mind. While automakers like Ford said the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit tempered demand for new cars, Scaringe reportedly took a different perspective . In a memo to employees, reported by the Wall Street Journal , Scaringe said the end of the incentive puts pressure on EV companies, including Rivian, to lower prices.\nBut increased competition has not always been greeted so fondly. Canada imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs in 2024, hoping to protect the burgeoning domestic market of electric cars. Scaringe, however, sees room for his rivals in the U.S.\n\nStory Continues\n“I really think the constraint isn&#8217;t the demand side. I think it&#8217;s the supply side,” Scaringe said. “I do think that the existence of choice will help drive more penetration, and it actually creates a unique opportunity in the United States.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
