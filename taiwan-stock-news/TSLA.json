      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Dec. 30: Tesla Falls After Offering Weak Delivery Outlook\n\nJosh Kohn-Lindquist, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:34 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGM\n\n^IXIC\n\nF\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) , the electric vehicle manufacturer, closed down 1.2% at $454.24 on Tuesday, as investors reacted to cautious delivery commentary and supply chain concerns. Tesla IPO'd in 2010 and has grown 28,500% since going public. Trading volume reached 58 million shares, which is very close to its three-month average.\n\nTuesday’s catalysts centered on Tesla’s company-compiled Q4 delivery consensus, analyst downgrades, and reports of a scaled-back battery deal.\n\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.13% to 6,896, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 0.24% to 23,419. Among industry peers, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) fell 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively, as investors weighed shifting EV strategies and broader uncertainty across the sector.\n\nWhat this means for investors On Tuesday morning, Tesla provided guidance that it would deliver 422,850 vehicles in the fourth quarter. This was well shy of a recent survey's analyst average of 445,000 and represents a 15% decline from Q4 2024. This prompted a downgrade to equal-weight by one prominent Wall Street firm, helping spur today's decline.\n\nThe underwhelming figures come just one day after a key supplier erased the majority of a massive EV battery deal with Tesla, sparking concerns that its Cybertruck sales may continue to disappoint. Trading with a market cap of $1.5 trillion -- and at a lofty 17 times sales -- Tesla may need to stick the landing on its pivot to autonomous vehicles, AI, and robotics, to live up to its hefty valuation.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Dec. 30: Nio Rallies on Upbeat Q4 Sales Outlook\n\nEmma Newbery, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NIO\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nLI\n\nTSLA\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) , a smart electric-vehicle maker, closed Tuesday’s session at $5.50, up 3.00%. The stock has gained 10.00% in the past five days. Trading volume reached 77.5 million shares, coming in about 32% above versus its three-month average of 52.4 million shares.\nTuesday’s trading featured stronger fourth-quarter sales projections and China’s extended EV trade-in subsidies. Nio IPO'd in 2018 and has fallen 16% since going public.\n\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.14% to 6,896, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 0.24% to 23,419. Auto manufacturers peers were mixed as investors compared Nio’s stronger Q4 outlook with ongoing competition in premium EVs. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell by 1.13% and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) gained 0.64%.\n\nWhat this means for investors Nio extended its upward streak today as investors reacted to positive sales projections and a Chinese government policy change. Chinese officials announced an extension to trade-in subsidies for electric vehicles. According to Sherwood News, the shift in policy will give consumers up to $2,850 towards a qualifying new vehicle, boosting demand.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO William Li told Chinese media that the company's Q4 vehicle sales will come in above 30 billion yuan (around $4.3 billion). This reassured the market after Nio's Q3 revenue disappointed. The upbeat sales figures come against a backdrop of chip shortages, which are impacting delivery of its new ES8 SUV orders.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports on what the automaker is expecting to report.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nand Tesla is doing something it almost never does. It's previewing its own fourth quarter deliveries release and lowering expectations, signaling a sharper year-over-year decline than many on Wall Street expected. Joining me for more is a Yahoo Finance senior auto reporter, Prassy Ranan. So Prass, break this all down for us. Why did they decide to release it and what do you make of the early release?\n00:23 Pras Subramanian\nWell, there's no real reason that we know, right? It's really unusual putting this out. Basically they they did their own Wall Street consensus estimates. They pulled, you know, using different uh analyst estimates there and they said that they claim consensus is at 40 400 423,000 units globally. I forgot the thousand there. representing a 15% drop year-over-year, right? Uh now that's below Bloomberg's own 445,000 uh delivery estimate. So it's significantly lower there.\n01:03 Pras Subramanian\nUh for the year consensus assessment, Tesla says 1.64 million deliveries, an 8% drop compared to a year ago and the second straight year of declines year over year for Tesla. So, you know, what's going on here? You know, why would you release these estimates, right? Some people think that they're trying to cushion the blow of a really bad Q4 report. You know, we had the loss of tax credit affecting sales and maybe it's worse than we thought. So that's probably what's going on here maybe.\n01:31 Pras Subramanian\nUh but for the stock, it doesn't matter, right? Declining sales don't matter. Stock is up, you know, a little bit down today, but up for the year. It's all about AI and Robo taxis.\n01:40 Speaker A\nYeah, and back in September, we saw the cost of a vehicle jump up because of that expiration of the EV tax credit. More and more people are trying to get their electric vehicles before the tax credit expired.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But it will likely face more competition too, especially from Tesla ( TSLA ). Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports on what lies ahead for Waymo.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nLet's talk about robotaxis because you think that 2026 could actually be a big year for one of Tesla's biggest competitors and that's Google's Waymo. So break down why is 2026 going to be such a big year?\n00:10 Pras\nYou know, starting off anecdotally, right? I was just in Austin, Texas for the for the holidays and they are everywhere. Waymos are everywhere, dropping people off, picking people up.\n00:20 Speaker A\nPeople are using them. It's easy.\n00:21 Pras\nYeah, I must have seen about 100 and I saw one Tesla robotaxi, right?\n00:25 Speaker A\nOh wow.\n00:25 Pras\nNow, now that's that's because\n00:26 Speaker A\n100 though. That's that's unlike what you're seeing here in the northeast.\n00:29 Pras\nWell, well not yet, right? Um so so then and then they've been in LA. I was in LA this past summer, they're all over LA. So they've really grown in the spots that they're actually operating, which is San Francisco, Phoenix, LA, Austin, and Atlanta, right? They're operating these areas without safety drivers. completely. there's no one in the car. It's just an empty car driving around. So, they're actually doing it and they're and they're charging for it, right? Uh they're going to in 2026 they're going to expand to Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Orlando with full service expected in the early 2026, and they're testing in Detroit, DC, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis.\n01:05 Pras\neven New York City, London and Tokyo, they're testing there. We'll see if that happens. But you know, very deep deeply populated urban areas that's really tough for excuse me robotaxis. So, that's happening.\n01:18 Pras\nNow, by the numbers. Uh right at the end of this year, Waymo was at 250,000 trips a week, right?\n01:24 Speaker A\nWow.\n01:25 Pras\nThey want to do an and sorry, and 20 million for the entire time they've been operating. They want to do million rides a week now by the end of the year.\n01:31 Speaker A\nNow and is this doable. Do you think they can do it?\n01:32 Pras\nSo at the end of next year. So that's four times.\n01:34 Pras\nI mean if if the if the deployments go well. Uh now you mentioned, can they do it? That's a good question because they have to increase production on their cars. They're building their their their EVs with the Jaguar I-PACE and the a Zeekr, Chinese model. But that costs money. And they don't have Tesla's ability to just crank out cars, right? So that's a potential headwind. Uh secondly, what about regulations and safety? Uh you know, sometimes some many municipalities don't want to have that. Or you have a big sort of safety issue like like Cruise did in San Francisco and that just knocks them out of the game. So those are some of the headwinds that they're facing. But\n02:04 Pras\nthat aside, 2026 could be a big year for them.\n02:07 Speaker A\nYeah, and you did mention your story that's now on Yahoo Finance's site that Tesla operates its ridehailing service with safety occupants still. And they're and only in Austin and San Francisco and that's since mid 2025. So it seems like even though there was so much excitement especially around June for Tesla's robotaxis, it seems like they're behind the game compared to Google's Waymo.\n02:24 Pras\nYeah, yeah, I mean and and the number of vehicles is actually pretty low too, right, compared to what Waymo is doing. They now Tesla says they're going to expand to to Las Vegas. I'm sorry, I'm sorry Nevada and then also Phoenix. That's the next the next spots for them. Um and then people like Ives think that's going to be 30 more markets by end of next year. I think that's overly optimistic because we haven't even heard what the next markets are. They haven't even pulled a safe driver out of the in Austin and San Francisco yet. So, a lot of big ifs there, but of course that's the sort of the big payoff if they actually do it.\n02:47 Speaker A\nRight. Wedbush's Dan Ives always bullish on Tesla, though. Pras Subramanian, thank you so much for joining me in studio. Appreciate it.\n02:51 Pras\nYeah.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) Cybertruck amid poor sales .\n‘I'm Keeping It For Now,' Ross Gerber Says On Sunday, a user on the social media platform X, Miss Jilianne , shared a post criticizing the EV giant's all-electric pickup truck. She claimed that almost every \"Tesla influencer\" returned the Cybertruck \"due to mechanical issues\" with the vehicle. She did not elaborate on what the issues were in the post.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nResponding to the post, Gerber shared that he would be holding on to his Cybertruck. \"I have not had any issues with my Cybertruck,\" the investor shared, adding that he would be \"keeping it for now\" as he likes it.\nTesla Cybertruck's Poor Run Tesla, in Q3 2025, sold just 5,385 Cybertruck units in the U.S., which illustrated a 62.6% YoY decline for the pickup truck. The EV giant is also reportedly sitting on tens of thousands of unsold units of the truck, with the affordable RWD Long-Range version of the pickup doing little to improve sales figures. Gerber had also called on Tesla to discontinue the vehicle altogether.\n\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nRoss Gerber's FSD Woes Gerber, on the other hand, also recently shared his experience with Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, saying that the technology wouldn't work well in the rain with its vision-based approach, as it mistook raindrops for debris on the FSD camera. \"Not sure of teslas plans if FSD doesn't work well in rain or direct sunlight…\" Gerber said.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the investor had earlier hailed the improvements made by Tesla to the FSD system with the FSD v14 update. \"This version is a big step up from 13 which was not good,\" he said of the v14 update. However, Tesla's poor sales have drawn concern from Gerber, who thinks that the company may never make GAAP profits ever again.\n\nStory Continues\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

Policy makers voted to reduce rates by 25 basis points earlier this month.\n\"A few participants judged that lowering the federal funds rate target range at this meeting was not justified because data received over the intermeeting period did not suggest any significant further weakening in the labor market,\" said the minutes released on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe US stock market will be open on Wednesday — New Year's Eve — with regular hours for the final trading day of 2025.

      "Content": "Why Lucid Could Continue to Set Record Quarters but Disappoint Investors\n\nDaniel Miller, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 12:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LCID\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points An early investment in Tesla would have proven wildly lucrative today.\nLucid has set seven consecutive quarterly records for deliveries.\nWith the Gravity base trim on the way, it should further boost demand for the vehicle.\n10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›\nIf you bought $10,000 of Tesla stock the day it went public , you'd have roughly $2.9 million right now. That's in a different world compared to the same investment in the broader S&P 500 that would be worth only about $66,000. While Tesla is one of a kind, it's that opportunity and those potential returns that have investors intrigued by other start-up electric vehicle (EV) makers such as Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID) -- and if the latter keeps setting records for deliveries each quarter, should investors jump on board?\n\nMore records on deck? If you've been following Lucid over the past year and a half, you're probably aware that the company's delivery announcements have been almost entirely positive. Lucid delivered more than 4,000 vehicles during the third quarter, marking its seventh consecutive quarterly record. The result was a sizable 23% increase over the second quarter, and a 46% jump compared to the prior year.\n\nLucid has openly acknowledged that the Gravity production acceleration has gone a bit slower than desired, thanks to supply chain issues, including a shortage of Chinese magnets that held some of the automotive industry hostage during the spring. After navigating its way through some choppy waters that include those supply chain issues, as well as tariffs and the expiration of the $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit, there's good news: Significant progress has been made with Gravity production, and the next step for the vehicle should enable the company to continue setting quarterly delivery records.\nIt's also worth noting that the Gravity is expected to have six times the addressable market as Lucid's Air sedan, leaving immense potential in the near term as production ramps up.\n\nEnter the Touring It's common for automakers to launch premium versions or trims of vehicles first, to get more profitable production on the roads, and that's the playbook Lucid took with the Gravity launch. Currently, the Gravity Grand Touring sells with a starting price of $96,550, including shipping. Originally, Lucid promised a sub-$80,000 sticker price, which is finally being realized in the Touring. In addition to the Touring and Grand Touring, Lucid has developed a top-end Gravity Dream Edition priced at $141,550 with shipping.\n\nStory Continues\nLucid is currently launching the base version of the Gravity crossover with the Touring trim that delivers on the promised price tag and boasts 560 horsepower that helps the vehicle reach 60 miles per hour in 4 seconds. \"The Lucid Gravity Touring unlocks a new audience for the Lucid brand,\" said interim CEO Marc Winterhoff, according to Automotive News . \"There's not another SUV in its segment that can deliver the combination of range, interior space, and driving performance.\"\nWith the Gravity's base trim finally in production, it should position the EV maker to continue driving its deliveries higher. With all of that said, why then is Lucid's stock down roughly 52% over the past three months?\nWhat's the problem? The problem for Lucid investors isn't the company's surging deliveries or even the top-line it supports; rather, it's a cash squeeze and missed estimates sending the stock lower recently. Lucid lowered its annual production estimate over the summer to a range of 18,000 to 20,000 before settling on the low end of that range, missed top and bottom-line Wall Street estimates during the third quarter, and is still burning through cash.\n\nLucid increased its delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to $2 billion, which gives Lucid more capital for running business operations. Lucid also raised roughly $975 million in a private offering of convertible senior notes due in 2031, and most of the proceeds will go to repurchase existing senior notes due in 2026. These moves improved Lucid's financial flexibility in the near term and largely avoided shareholder dilution; however, this is likely not the end of Lucid's long-term capital needs.\nLucid promotes its consistent and continuous record of quarterly deliveries, but it's essential to recognize that Lucid faces numerous challenges ahead to achieve scale in production and deliveries, while also reducing costs to drive profitability. For most investors, Lucid is currently too risky to invest in, even with likely more record quarters ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lucid Group right now? Before you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lucid Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Google's AI Renaissance (Growth Story is Far from Over)\n\nAndrew Rocco\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGoogle Company Overview Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Alphabet ( GOOGL ) is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly accounting for roughly 90% of the online search volume and market share. Over the years, the company has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nAI Cannibalization Fears Overblown\nAlphabet’s dominant search market share and expanding cloud footprint are key growth drivers for the company. Initially, Google’s AI efforts got off to a shaky start. For instance, in Google’s first version AI model named “Bard,” searches often were completely inaccurate. Meanwhile, it appeared that ChatGPT and other models were running away with the AI race. However, several iterations later, and Google’s Gemini 2.5 AI delivers some of the most rapid responses in the industry and is viewed as an industry standard. Meanwhile, investor fears about cannibalization of the search business are unfounded. In fact, Google’s unique hybrid AI search model has driven popularity among younger users. Gemini models are being rapidly embedded across Search, YouTube, Android, and Workspace, enhancing user experience and driving internal productivity (e.g., coding, customer service).\n\nGoogle’s Groundbreaking TPU Google has constructed its own chips to power AI bots. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built to dramatically accelerate machine learning (ML) tasks, especially large-scale training and inference for models like Google's Gemini, powering Search, Photos, and more, available via Google Cloud and functioning as a core component of Google’s AI Hypercompute system. A TPU board fits into the same slot as a hard drive on the massive hardware racks inside the data centers that power Google's online services, the company says, adding that its own chips provide \"an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning\" than other hardware options. TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation.\"\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Gloud: A Consistent Growth Engine Alphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. In third-quarter 2025, Google Cloud revenues increased 33.5% year over year to $15.16 billion. Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics, and AI are positive. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, along with the growing number of data centers are helping Google expand its cloud footprint worldwide. Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA ( NVDA ) in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3, and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and the low-code Agent Designer tool.\n\nAd Business & YouTube Drive Top Line Growth AI is improving ad targeting and effectiveness, making the core business more resilient and profitable even with AI challengers. Meanwhile, YouTube continues to perform exceptionally well, acting as another strong pillar for revenue growth (especially the short-form video side). Zacks’ Consensus estimate sees double-digit top-line growth for the full year 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFuture Growth: Waymo Robotaxis Waymo is completing over 450,000 paid robotaxi rides per week across its operating areas, including Phoenix, LA, SF, and Austin. Reports from late 2025 indicate significant volume, a substantial increase from earlier in the year, with goals to reach 1 million weekly rides by late 2026. While I believe Tesla ( TSLA ) is poised to win the robotaxi race due to its scale and costs, there will likely not be one winner-takes-all and Waymo will have a significant chunk.\n\nImage Source: OurWorldinData\nBerkshire Hathaway Buys Alphabet Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently made a significant surprise investment, buying a $4.3 billion stake in Google's parent company, Alphabet, during the third quarter of 2025, marking a major tech bet for the value investor, likely driven by Alphabet's strong market dominance in search, its lucrative ad network, and potential in AI, despite Buffett's usual tech hesitation.\n\nGOOGL Has a Reasonable Valuation Google consistently has among the lowest P/Es among the Mag 7 stocks. With a P/E of 30x EPS, it’s reasonably priced and unsurprising that Buffett wants a piece. Additionally, the company has about $100 billion in cash and only $20 billion in debt. The strong cash balance provides the flexibility required to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStrong Trend & Technicals GOOGL shares have outperformed the general market indices and trended higher all year in a stair-stepping fashion. Investors can use the intermediate 10-week moving average as a trend guide.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nAlphabet remains one of the most strategically positioned companies in technology, combining dominant search economics, accelerating cloud momentum, and expanding AI-driven fundamentals.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Tesla Breaks With Tradition as It Braces Markets for a Weak Q4\n\nCharles Kennedy\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 9:58 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nFor the first time, Tesla has taken the unusual step of previewing its own delivery expectations ahead of its fourth-quarter results, a move that has raised eyebrows across Wall Street.\nIn a post on its investor relations website, Tesla published what it called a &ldquo;company-compiled delivery consensus,&rdquo; putting global Q4 deliveries at 422,850 vehicles, a figure that would mark a 15% year-on-year decline. That estimate sits below Bloomberg&rsquo;s broader consensus of around 445,000 units, which implies a milder 10% drop. Tesla noted the median analyst estimate was even lower, at roughly 420,400 vehicles.\n\nThe early disclosure has fueled speculation that Tesla is attempting to soften the market reaction ahead of a disappointing report. While Tesla shares were little changed in early trading, the numbers underline mounting pressure on the company&rsquo;s core auto business.\nA fourth-quarter slowdown was widely expected following the loss of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit at the start of the quarter. U.S. sales appear to have taken a particularly hard hit. According to Cox Automotive&rsquo;s Kelley Blue Book, Tesla sold about 125,900 vehicles in the U.S. during Q4, down more than 22% from a year earlier. International markets were expected to offset some of that weakness, but not enough to prevent an overall decline.\nFor the full year, consensus expectations now point to roughly 1.64 million deliveries , an 8% drop from 2024 and Tesla&rsquo;s second consecutive annual decline. Deutsche Bank has warned even those estimates may prove optimistic.\n\nOrdinarily, back-to-back years of falling sales would be difficult to reconcile with Tesla&rsquo;s valuation. The stock is up nearly 14% this year and trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio north of 200. Yet many analysts argue Tesla is no longer being valued as a carmaker.\nBullish analysts increasingly frame Tesla as a long-term bet on autonomy, robotics, and AI, with robotaxis and full self-driving technology seen as the real prize. In that context, weak deliveries matter&mdash;but not as much as the promise of what comes next.\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

      "Content": "Debt Is 'The Most Aggressively Marketed Product' In History, Says Dave Ramsey, After He Was Offered Klarna Payments For A T-Shirt\n\nAdrian Volenik\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 9:31 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: V\n\nMA\n\nKLAR\n\nTSLA\n\nFinancial expert Dave Ramsey responded to a listener’s question on an episode of “ The Ramsey Show ” about how someone could end up with 35 credit cards . His answer was straightforward: banks don’t care if you can afford it. They care if they can profit off of you.\nCredit Cards Are Marketed Harder Than Anything Else “That’s sweet that you’d think common sense would enter into this transaction,” Ramsey said to the listener named Cory. He explained that banks and credit card companies hand out credit not because people are financially sound, but because debt is extremely profitable.\nDon't Miss:\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n\n“We now, at this moment in 2024 in America, live in the most marketed-to, sold-to culture in the history of the world,” Ramsey said. “And among the most marketed-to group of people in the history of the human race, the most aggressively marketed product is debt .”\n“There are loans for everything,” he said about the constant push to finance even the smallest purchases. “I was trying to buy a T-shirt, for God’s sakes, and they offered me payments on it with Klarna ,” Ramsey said. “It’s a T-shirt! Why would you? Three easy payments of $1.26. I mean, come on.”\nRamsey warned listeners not to assume getting approved for credit means anything good. “Please God, don’t think you’re special if somebody gave you a credit card,” Ramsey said. He said they used to collect bizarre credit card stories, and among them was one in which even a dead pet had been approved–a person received a card for his deceased poodle, Fruu. Another card was sent to “Buck Naked,” a name someone made up as a joke.\n\nTrending: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nCo-host Rachel Cruze added that Visa (NYSE: V ) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA ) together hold 80% of the market and testified in front of Congress last year. Their refusal to lower swipe fees for small businesses showed, in her view, how little concern they have for the average American. “It makes you sick, it makes you realize; literally off the backs of Americans, this is what they’re making,” she said.\n“They’re here to make money off of you, and they know how to do it,” she added. “Like, that’s their job.”\nThe hosts concluded by reminding listeners that getting a new credit card doesn’t make you successful or financially savvy. Ramsey summed it up like this: “If you’re issued a new credit card, you’re no better than Fruu Fruu or Buck.”\n\nStory Continues\nRead Next:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n$100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "Tesla expected to deliver 15% fewer vehicles in Q4\n\nShannon Carroll\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla’s car sales continue to go in reverse — and the company is taking the unusual route of broadcasting that. Tesla published a compilation of analyst estimates on its website , and the fourth-quarter consensus from 20 firms pegs deliveries at 422,850 vehicles. If that figure holds, it lands roughly 15% below last year’s Q4 result and extends a slow, stubborn theme: Tesla’s growth story, in car units, keeps tripping over the real world.\n\nThe story here is less “analysts have an estimate” and more “Tesla chose the estimate.” And it chose a gloomy one. Tesla’s posted average is more pessimistic than Bloomberg’s compiled consensus (of about 445,061 vehicles), and other trackers have been higher, too (in the mid-440,000s range).\nSo Tesla is setting the bar where it wants the conversation to start: on the floor — and handing everyone a tape measure.\nT​his “soft” fourth quarter is arriving after a year that has looked like three different stories taped together. Tesla delivered 336,681 vehicles in Q1 2025; deliveries rose to 384,122 in Q2; and then, Tesla hit a record in Q3 : 497,099 deliveries. Now, the consensus says Q4 gives back a solid chunk of that momentum — and the reason is less about factory choreography or consumer behavior and more about policy gravity .\n\nFederal EV tax credits — $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used — expired on Sept. 30, 2025. And deadlines like that don’t erase short-term demand so much as rearrange it. Buyers who were on the fence get shoved into a single quarter, and the next quarter gets stuck holding the bag. Tesla’s November U.S. sales fell nearly 23% year over year to 39,800 vehicles, according to Cox Automotive data, even after Tesla rolled out cheaper ( but still not that cheap ) “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3.\nCEO Elon Musk has tried to wave away vehicle demand anxiety as a media obsession — “they’re fine, don’t worry about it,” he said in May — even as he later warned investors to brace for “a few rough quarters” in what he called a “weird transition period.” Tesla has been trying to ramp up the conversation about its long-promised robotaxis in Austin, Texas, ahead of Musk’s year-end target for safety-monitor-free rides. With a day to spare, it looks like that prediction's at least true in testing (and not at the fleet level as Musk has promised): Musk says a “Tesla with no safety monitor” drove him around Austin, and Tesla’s AI lead posted video of an empty front seat.\n\nZoom out, and the EV market is growing, but unevenly. Global EV registrations rose 6% in November, yet North America fell 42% as the post-credit slump spread. Europe is moving in the opposite direction on adoption — battery-electric vehicles are 17% of EU registrations year-to-date through November. Add in intensifying competition, including cheaper EV options from legacy automakers such as Chevrolet and Ford and expanding Chinese brands overseas, and Tesla’s fourth-quarter setup starts to look structural, not seasonal.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd yet, none of this has stopped Tesla’s stock from behaving like the car business is merely the opening act. The company’s shares are up more than 10% this year (and 21% year to date), a sign that plenty of investors are paying for the robotaxi dream and tolerating the delivery math. That split — cars down, narrative up — remains Tesla’s one real magic trick.\nTesla has already trained investors to expect a rationale for every wobble. Earlier in the year, the company blamed a Model Y line changeover across all four factories for “several weeks” of lost production. Q4 doesn’t come with that built-in excuse. If the consensus is right, this is what demand looks like when the incentives are gone, the field is crowded, and Tesla has to sell cars like a normal automaker — while its stock still trades like an AI bet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

That compares with a Bloomberg-compiled average of 440,907 vehicles, an 11% drop.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nWhile Tesla’s investor relations team has compiled sales estimates and shared averages selectively with analysts and investors for years, the company hasn’t published the figures in the past.\n“This is highly unusual,” Gary Black, co-founder of Future Fund Advisors, wrote on X. “Obviously, someone at TSLA wanted the IR-derived consensus to be distributed as widely as possible,” he added, speculating that Tesla’s deliveries are likely to be in the range of 420,000 vehicles.\nTesla is on course for its second consecutive drop in annual vehicle sales, with the company compiling an average estimate for 1.6 million deliveries, down more than 8% from a year earlier. The carmaker’s estimates for the next three years are also lower than averages compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe company’s shares fell as much as 1.3% on Tuesday before erasing the decline.\nTesla’s sales plunged early in the year as the company retooled production lines at each of its assembly plants for the redesigned Model Y, its most popular vehicle. That period also coincided with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk playing a polarizing role in the Trump administration.\nDeliveries jumped to a record in the third quarter, when US consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles before $7,500 federal tax credits ceased at the end of September. Tesla partially offset the loss of those incentives at the beginning of the current quarter by rolling out stripped-down versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan each priced at under $40,000.\nTesla’s stock is poised to end the year higher despite its vehicle sales slump.

      "Content": "Tesla previews a drop in its upcoming Q4 deliveries in unusual move\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:14 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nIn a first for the company, Tesla ( TSLA ) previewed its own fourth quarter quarter deliveries release.\nOn its investor relations site , Tesla posted its own Wall Street consensus estimates for Q4 and full-year deliveries. For Q4, Tesla said \"company compiled delivery consensus\" came in at 422,850 units globally, which would represent a 15% drop from a year ago.\nInterestingly, that figure is below the 445,000 delivery estimate as compiled via Bloomberg, which would only be a 10% drop. Tesla reported the median estimate was 420,399.\nTesla stock was little changed in early trading on Tuesday.\n\nSome commentators have speculated that Tesla's release of these compiled estimates means the company is trying to get ahead of a poor delivery report and cushion the blow.\nA fourth quarter delivery drop is not exactly a surprise given the loss of the $7,500 EV tax credit at the start of the quarter. The question was how bad the drop would be in the US and whether international markets could overcome sales losses in the US. Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book estimates Tesla US sales fell to 125.9K units in the quarter, down 22.4%.\n\nFor the year, Tesla's consensus estimates came in at 1,640,752 deliveries, an 8% drop compared to 2024 and the automaker's second consecutive year of sales declines.\nDeutsche Bank also feels the Wall Street consensus of over 1.6 million units is too optimistic.\n\"We believe consensus estimates of 1.66m in deliveries may be too high and we model 1.62m units based on our 4Q assumptions, implying down 9% YoY,\" analyst Edison Yu wrote in mid December.\nA second consecutive year of sales losses isn't typically congruent for a stock that has gained nearly 14% this year, with a forward P/E of over 200, per Yahoo Finance calculations .\nBut analysts like Deutsche Bank's Yu and Wedbush's Dan Ives argue fundamentals don't matter for stocks like Tesla, which are bets more on mobility, robotics, and AI than the traditional auto business.\nYu and Ives are bullish on Tesla's robotaxi prospects.\n\"Perhaps more importantly though, the narrative around robotaxi remains strong despite the size of the fleet tracking smaller than expected thus far,\" Yu wrote. \"In late October, [CEO] Elon Musk alluded to 1,000 vehicles in the Bay Area and 500 or more in Austin.

      "Content": "Exchanges Decline to List Tuttle Capital's GRFT ETF Despite SEC Effectiveness\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:58 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nCBOE\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nWall Street's roughly $13 trillion ETF ecosystem continued to push deeper into higher-risk territory this year, as issuers leaned into demand from retail investors drawn to leverage, yield and unconventional strategies. Against that backdrop, Tuttle Capital Management encountered resistance with its proposed Government Grift ETF, ticker GRFT, which is intended to invest in companies with perceived connections to political power in Washington. While the fund's registration became effective with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the fourth quarter, Bloomberg Intelligence's James Seyffart noted that this step represents a procedural milestone rather than an active regulatory endorsement, potentially limiting its path forward. Despite that status, Tuttle said the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets have so far declined to list the ETF, offering little explanation beyond informal rejections.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe stalled listing arrives as high-octane ETFs including leveraged single-stock products, crypto-themed funds and strategies tied to short-dated options have proliferated, supported by a regulatory tone that took shape during the Trump administration. Tuttle has previously filed leveraged ETFs linked to figures and companies such as Michael Saylor, Trump's media company, Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), positioning his firm around turning market narratives into volatile trading vehicles aimed at risk-seeking investors. GRFT, which would be actively managed, does not reference specific politicians or administrations, but is designed to track what Tuttle has described as unusual congressional trading activity, reflecting a view that political proximity could be associated with financial outcomes.\n\nSome industry analysts have suggested the ETF's premise could expose exchanges to reputational or administrative risk, possibly drawing regulatory or congressional scrutiny. While politically themed ETFs already exist including NANC and GOP, launched in 2023 to track disclosures under the STOCK Act, and MAGA, launched in 2017 critics argue GRFT's framing is more pointed and potentially contentious. Skeptics also note that any link between political access and market outperformance is often assumed rather than demonstrated, with outcomes shaped by slow-moving policy decisions and broader industrial factors. Even so, Tuttle has said his remaining hope lies with the Texas Stock Exchange, which is expected to begin trading in the first quarter next year, and he plans to keep the ETF's name, ticker and investment thesis unchanged, arguing that presidential politics in the Trump era could continue to have an unusually direct influence on individual stocks.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The milestone underscores the enormous volume of real-world data powering Tesla&rsquo;s recent and increasingly visible progress in FSD development.\n\nPer Tesla, vehicles running FSD have logged more than 6.99 billion miles to date. Tesla owner and frequent FSD tester Whole Mars Catalog also shared a screenshot showing that more than 2.5 billion of those miles were accumulated on city streets.\n\nOne of Tesla&rsquo;s key strengths in autonomous driving is the sheer scale of its fleet and the number of vehicles continuously training FSD in real-world conditions. Nearly 7 billion miles of driving data enable Tesla to deploy updates that make its vehicles operate with the smoothness and judgment of seasoned human drivers, even when driving autonomously.\n\nRecently, Tesla launched Europe&rsquo;s first public shuttle service using FSD (Supervised) in the rural Eifelkreis Bitburg-Pr&uuml;m region of Germany.

According to Tesla's count, the expectation is deliveries will be down 15% in the final three months of the year compared to a year ago.\n00:30 Speaker A\nAnd that estimate is even worse than Wall Street consensus, but the news doesn't appear to be bad enough to shaking to shake investor optimism.

The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers.

This is a lot more than what Mercedes-Benz and BMW manufacture.\nThe Model Y sold the most. It featured a long range, quick acceleration, and could be used as an SUV. Analysts say that Tesla's success originates from the fact that it seems like a tech savvy brand and that young people regard it as a technology instead of a car because of the \"fandom culture.\" People are still thrilled about the device even if there have been recalls and other problems since the software is updated often and it looks good.\nThe stock's average price target is $385.34, which suggests it might drop 17% from its current level.

The firm also pointed to “positive data points for FSD,” including praise for FSD 14 from Nvidia’s robotics team.\nBaird maintained its $548 price target on TSLA, based on around 70 times its 2030 EBITDA estimate discounted to year-end 2026.\nRelated articles\nTesla stock forecast: Baird previews 2026\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

This figure is notably lower than the Bloomberg-compiled average of 445,061 vehicles, which indicates a 10% drop.\n\nWhile Tesla’s investor relations team has been compiling average delivery estimates for years, this marks the first time the company has shared these figures on its investor relations page.\nThe electric vehicle maker appears to be heading toward its second consecutive annual decline in vehicle sales. The company has compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million deliveries for the full year, down more than 8% compared to last year.\nDespite the vehicle sales slump, Tesla’s stock is on track to end the year with gains.

The year 2025 remains on track to be a positive one for equity investors, but the success of the Santa Claus Rally is by no means assured as some caution and volatility seems to be in play. Along those lines, reading the tea leaves contained in insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research is a challenging task this week. For starters, transaction volume historically is low in the final trading days of any year, diminishing the quality of the data. But this year, the days are 'even quieter' because of two 'added' federal holidays that left the SEC closed for three of the five business days last week (the SEC being the source of the Form 4 documents filed by insiders when they transact). To add some detail, 466 filings meet the criteria for inclusion in Vickers' Weekly Insider Report this week, compared to 1641 last week. Turning to longer-term (eight-week) data to mitigate the short-term (one-week) weakness, we note that the data is solidly neutral, suggesting corporate insiders are not eager to buy stock -- but nor are they selling aggressively. On a scale where the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, Vickers' eight-week sell/buy ratio for the NYSE is 3.44, the Nasdaq ratio is 3.90, and the Total (all exchanges) ratio is 3.67.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

CEO Elon Musk has slammed Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates amid the USAID cuts row.\nBill Gates Is A Liar Taking to the social media platform X on Sunday, the billionaire criticized Gates in response to a post that aimed at claims about deaths resulting from the President Donald Trump administration's announcement of funding cuts provided to the UN via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nMusk said that Gates was \"pushing this lie, despite having over $80 billion dollars in his NGO,\" calling the claims false. He added that the former Microsoft CEO could \"easily spend to save these alleged lives that are being lost.\" Musk also added that Gates was \"a liar.\"\nThe Gates Foundation didn’t immediately respond to Benzinga ‘s request for comment.\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nIt's worth noting that Gates had earlier warned of \"devastating effects\" on HIV programs in Africa. The billionaire had also raised concerns about the Trump administration's decision to cut funding would result in millions of people being unvaccinated and trigger a global health crisis.\n\nElon Musk's DOGE Cut Aid Gates has previously expressed concerns about the aid cuts. The aid cuts stemmed from the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effectively shutting down by significant funding cuts to USAID, as it was \"time for it to die,\" according to the SpaceX CEO back in February.\nMusk and Gates have also clashed over other topics. Most notably, the Tesla CEO has called out Gates over his alleged short position against Tesla stock that Gates has had \"for ~8 years,\" according to Musk.\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

That compares with a Bloomberg-compiled average of 445,061 vehicles, a 10% drop.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nWhile Tesla’s investor relations team has compiled average delivery estimates for years, the company hasn’t shared the figures on its IR page in the past. The carmaker is on course for its second consecutive decline in annual vehicle sales, having compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million deliveries, down more than 8% from a year earlier.\nTesla’s sales plunged early in the year as the company retooled production lines at each of its assembly plants for the redesigned Model Y, its most popular vehicle. That period also coincided with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk playing a polarizing role in the Trump administration.\nDeliveries jumped to a record in the third quarter, when US consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles before $7,500 federal tax credits ceased at the end of September. Tesla partially offset the loss of those incentives at the beginning of the current quarter by rolling out stripped-down versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan each priced at under $40,000.\nTesla’s stock is poised to end the year higher despite its vehicle sales slump. The shares were up 14% through Monday’s close, trailing the 17% rise in the S&P 500 Index.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Silver and gold swung after a sharp pullback from fresh all-time highs, as traders booked profits and liquidity thinned after the holidays.\nCrypto traders kept describing the same theme, a market that keeps moving, then does it with less depth.\nMarket snapshot Bitcoin : $87,164, down 1.9%\nEther : $2,929, down 2.3%\nXRP: $1.85, down 2.2%\nTotal crypto market cap: $3.03 trillion, down 2.1%\nBitcoin And Ether Drift Sideways As Year-End Volumes Fade Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, said year-end trading has slowed and volumes have faded across major assets. “Bitcoin and Ethereum have both traded largely sideways over the past week, reflecting seasonal inactivity rather than a meaningful shift in market structure,” he said.\n“Activity has cooled across most chains, with a broad consolidation in active addresses, transactions, and fees generated over the past 30 days. Chains like Base saw notable pullbacks in DEX volumes following a very strong run earlier in the year. Solana remains the dominant venue for onchain trading by volume, even as user activity softened slightly over the week, with BNB Chain a distant second.”\n\n“Overall, trading activity hasn’t disappeared; it has simply slowed and become more selective as the year comes to a close.”\nProfit-Taking Hits Metals After New Highs Macro investors, meanwhile, stayed focused on the policy path. Investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes due later Tuesday, a release that often resets rate expectations when positioning runs crowded.\nThe bigger picture still shows a strong year for risk assets, despite the late-year wobbles. The MSCI All Country World Index has climbed about 21% in 2025, and a broad measure of Asian stocks has rallied almost 26%, according to market-wrap data.\n\nIn metals, the latest move showed how quickly crowded trades can unwind. Spot silver fell 4.8% on Monday after earlier hitting a record, and gold eased after setting its own peak on Friday, with profit-taking doing the heavy lifting.\nFor crypto, Bitcoin’s steadiness looked more like a positioning pause than a conviction push, with traders watching liquidity, flows and volatility pricing for the next move into the first week of 2026.\nRead original story Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Holds $87k As Asia Rally Stalls, Wall Street Tech Slips by Shalini Nagarajan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In a filing, L&F said the reason for the 99% reduction was a change in supply quantity.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nThe high-nickel cathode material that L&F was contracted to supply from January 2024 through this month was meant to be used in Cybertruck batteries, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive business transactions. Scant material was provided as the vehicle’s development was repeatedly postponed and consumers opted for other vehicles, including Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, the person said.\nThe supply contract was also affected by broader policy and economic issues, including the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, the person added. Tesla representatives didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nL&F said in a statement that the revision was inevitable as schedules were adjusted in line with changes in the global electric vehicle market and battery supply conditions.\n“There have been no changes to shipments or customer supply of the company’s flagship high-nickel product,” L&F said, adding that shipments to major Korean cell manufacturers are proceeding smoothly.\nShares of L&F, which also supplies battery makers including LG Energy Solution Ltd., dropped 11% in Seoul on Tuesday.

Nio IPO'd in 2018 and has fallen 19% since going public. Trading volume reached 68.1 million shares, nearly 28% above its three-month average of 53.4 million shares.\n\nHow the markets moved today Monday’s action followed premarket focus on Nio's deeper battery reliance on Contemporary Amperex Technology (OTC:CYAT.Y) and a bullish CEO sales outlook. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.33% to 6,907, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 0.50% to 23,474. Within the automotive industry, shares of sector rivals Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) dropped 3.27% and 1.61%, respectively.\n\nWhat this means for investors Nio has expanded its offerings by introducing two new brands, launching the mass-market brand Onvo and a new premium compact brand, Firefly, last year.\nThis strategy to expand market reach has so far been successful. October marked the first time the company delivered over 40,000 vehicles in a single month. This was followed by Nio's second-largest shipment month ever in November.\n\nToday's move came after Nio CEO William Li offered an upbeat Q4 forecast. The midpoint of Li's vehicle delivery guidance implies another new record of over 45,000 units is coming for December. Li also predicted very strong total fourth-quarter sales, indicating discounts aren't what's driving sales.\nNio stock also got a boost today from reports saying the company is relying more on CATL for batteries and has suspended supply cooperation with competitor BYD for the Onvo L60.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) dipped around 0.3%.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility gripped the precious metals trade after a furious rally to all-time highs . Silver ( SI=F ) retreated, plummeting as much as 7% after rising above $80, while gold ( GC=F ) futures fell over 3%.\nStocks fell after ending a shortened Christmas trading week near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 and Dow setting records on Wednesday to start the \"Santa Claus rally\" period — the last five trading days of December and first two sessions in January.\n\nAll three major indexes look set to end a topsy-turvy 2025 with strong gains. The benchmark S&P is up over 17%, and the blue-chip Dow has climbed over 14%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has led gains, adding over 21% so far — even after briefly entering a bear market in April after the rollout of President Trump's most sweeping tariffs .\nIn another otherwise relatively sleepy week for economic releases, one bright spot came on Monday as data showed pending home sales in November jumped the most since early 2023 — a sign that homebuyer momentum is building. But the highlight of the week will likely come Tuesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting earlier this month .\nThe minutes could add fresh insight for investors looking for clues on the Fed's next move in January, with the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 likely to continue into the new year . Around 80% of bets are on the Fed standing pat at current interest rate levels next month, though traders are more split on what the committee will do in March.\nLIVE 15 updates\n7 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nStocks slip as hopes of 'Santa Clause rally' fade Stocks pulled back on Monday as hopes of a \"Santa Claus\" rally during the last week of the year faced a setback.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) fell 0.5% as shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia ( NVDA ) fell 1% while EV maker Tesla ( TSLA ) dropped more than 3%.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) lost 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also slipped 0.5%.\nCrude prices rose more than 2% while precious metals retreated from all-time highs.

Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2.6% in the afternoon session after major indices pulled back from record highs reached the previous week.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq were under pressure as the dominant artificial intelligence trade cooled off. Notable names like Nvidia were down as traders locked in profits following a banner year where the Nasdaq surged over 20%. With the S&P 500 recently hitting intraday highs near 6,945, this dip reflected a shift in internal momentum rather than a response to major economic news.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunties to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Tesla? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 40 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 2.8% on the news that a Delaware Supreme Court ruling restored CEO Elon Musk's 2018 compensation plan, ending a long-running legal battle.\n\nThe court reversed a lower court's decision to cancel the $56 billion pay package. This news removed a significant legal uncertainty that had loomed over the company. Adding to the positive sentiment, the company reportedly began testing fully driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, without safety drivers, marking a major step toward commercial autonomous driving. Investor focus also turned to Tesla's 2026 product plans, which included a sub-$25,000 model and the first commercial use of its Cybercab. Further bolstering confidence, Deutsche Bank and RBC both raised their price targets on the stock.\nTesla is up 22.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $463.89 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $489.88 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,090.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened.

      "Content": "Why 2026 could be Waymo's year\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:58 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nUBER\n\nZK\n\nFrom Los Angeles to Austin to Atlanta, Waymo robotaxis are everywhere. And 2026 could be the year Waymo expands its lead in the space.\nWaymo, part of Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), began in 2009 as an in-house startup within Google's X initiative and officially became Waymo in 2016. In 2018, Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker's I-Pace EV for its testing. This is the vehicle most users are accustomed to seeing.\n\nSince 2020, anyone in its service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that it performs around 250,000 trips a week and has performed 20 million trips since the service began.\nBut those numbers are likely to jump, perhaps big-time. The company is targeting around 1 million rides a week by the end of 2026 — four times its current volume.\nWhy 2026 could be a big year for Waymo In 2026, Waymo will enter its most aggressive expansion phase yet, moving beyond its current territories to tackle more US cities and international markets.\nCurrently, Waymo has robotaxi fleets in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta, where users can summon vehicles using Waymo's app or from partners like Uber ( UBER ) in Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe plan for 2026 moves beyond those areas, eventually adding 20 new markets. Waymo says it is progressing in test areas in the South, including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, with full service expected to begin in early 2026.\nIn the West, the company plans to add Las Vegas and San Diego, with targeted service start dates in 2026.\nIn the Northeast, Waymo is testing in Detroit and Washington, D.C., also for 2026 launches, and added Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis to the list earlier this month. The difficulties with northern cities, which are prone to inclement weather and conditions like snow that could block the cars' sensors, is of particular importance. Each of these cities will begin Waymo service with human operators before scaling up to driverless. The human operator sits the driver's seat and takes over if needed.\n\nThe company is also testing in highly populous areas like New York City , which requires special permitting and will likely take a much longer time to ramp up to official service. The company did not give a targeted start date for New York City service. Waymo is also scheduled to add service in London, its first international market, starting sometime in 2026, and has been testing in Tokyo since April.\nFor its part, Tesla ( TSLA ), which operates a ride-hailing service service with safety occupants, has only been in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area since mid-2025 but will supposedly expand in Nevada and Phoenix next year.\n\nStory Continues\nTo meet these goals, the company is expanding its manufacturing facilities. Waymo, along with its manufacturing parter Magna, will expand its new plant in Arizona to double production and build more than 2,000 vehicles at the facility by the end of 2026.\nThe company will begin to assemble its next-generation robotaxi on Zeekr's RT platform, with the stated goal of building \"tens of thousands\" of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year.\n\nWall Street is mostly in favor.\n\"Waymo is furthest along in true driverless deployment: it is already operating fully autonomous ride-hail services in parts of Phoenix, San Francisco (Bay Area), Los Angeles, and testing in additional US cities, with no safety driver in the vehicle for many rides,\" Deutsche Bank's Edison Yu wrote in early December. \"These are limited geofence, high CAPEX operations, but they prove the technical feasibility of Level 4 autonomy in constrained urban zones.\"\nBut Yu added that Waymo's tech \"stack\" is heavily dependent on costly equipment like lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors, radar, and cameras, and is map-dependent, which slows scaling speed and pushes up the per-vehicle cost.\nMorgan Stanley's robotics research team, now led by longtime analyst Adam Jonas, agrees that Waymo's tech, though impressive, will be held back by higher costs compared to Tesla, which uses a vision-only system powered by a neural network, essentially acting like a robotic driver.\nIn Waymo's defense, the company and analysts like Deutsche Bank's Yu argue that the complement of sensors and cameras helps with reliability and safety.\nWaymo's data shows its robotaxis are involved in fewer accidents involving serious injury, airbag deployment, or any injury, for that matter, compared to human drivers. In fact, a human driver is five times more likely to be involved in an accident resulting in an injury compared to a Waymo robotaxi (0.8 crashes per 1 million miles in Waymo vs 3.96 crashes per 1 million miles with a human driver).\n\nThough details are still scarce, Tesla data via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shows Tesla robotaxis had seven crashes in 250,000 miles, implying a crash rate of around 28 crashes per 1 million miles.\nPublic safety is also a key regulatory challenge facing both Waymo and Tesla, with permitting across various municipalities complicated to navigate and possible overarching federal guidelines that the NHTSA hinted may be coming.\n\nAnd though not a passenger safety concern, the electrical blackout on Dec. 20 in San Francisco led to embarrassing \"bricking\" of Waymo robotaxis , leaving them stuck in the middle of streets, unable to move due to traffic signals being inoperative. Incidents like these are headaches for municipalities, though Waymo promises a software update will alleviate these incidents.\n\nNevertheless, passenger safety is most important, and Waymo's data reporting showing its strong safety record will help cities looking to test robotaxis in their jurisdictions, as well as win over the public, which may be open to but skeptical about riding in driverless cars.\nWaymo's own ubiquitousness may also help in its rollout. While a survey performed by the Verge in April 2024 found that, overall, 45% of respondents believed robotaxi services were safe (compared to 37% against), the percentages were actually higher in cities where Waymo was already operating (54% for and 32% against).\nA recent survey conducted in San Francisco this past July found that ​​67% of San Francisco residents now support the operation of driverless robotaxis, up from 44% in 2023, with \"net favorability\" of robotaxis swinging from -7% in late 2023 to +38% in mid-2025.\nPras Subramanian is Lead Auto Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ: NFLX ) to acquire the film and television assets of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD ) fear the deal will be the death of movie theaters , but \"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary says, \"Factually, that's not correct.\"\n\nIn a post on X , O'Leary argued that the competition isn't between streaming and theaters but a fight for human attention.\n\"People watch movies on their phones, their tablets, their home TVs, in theaters,\" he said. \"There's never been a more diversified way of screening content.\n\"The only restraining aspect of content consumption is how many hours people are awake,\" he added.\nDon't Miss:\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nO'Leary said Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is a prime example of why the big screen remains vital. Amazon continues to fund major theatrical releases because certain cinematic experiences cannot be replicated in a living room.\n\nTheaters that lean into high-end technology, such as 70-millimeter screens and the Dolby surround sound, he said.\n\"Those experiences cannot be emulated in a home,\" O'Leary said. \"If you've got a big-tent release, an action film particularly, most people would want to see that in an adequate surround sound, large screen. You need every tool you can get in the media war. \"\nWhile O'Leary says movie theaters aren't going anywhere, shifting consumer behavior shows that streaming at home is winning the volume game. About 75% of U.S. adults chose streaming a new release at least once in the past year, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll .\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate— Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nAlthough 66% of Americans still visited a cinema, only 16% maintained a monthly movie-going habit, nearly half the rate of frequent streamers, according to the poll.\nDriven by rising ticket prices and the post-pandemic desire for convenience, the data suggests that the couch has replaced the cinema as a preferred venue for routine viewing. The average cost of a movie ticket in the U.S. is $13.17, the Associated Press reported, citing data firm EntTelligence. In 2022, it was $11.76.\n\"There's some movies I would like to see, and I say to myself, I'll just wait until they show them on TV or I'll go visit a friend who has those apps,\" Maryneal Jones of North Carolina told the AP.

March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) are down -0.28%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) are down -0.27%.\n\nStock indexes are moving lower today, led by losses in megacap technology stocks. Also, today's plunge in metals prices is weighing on mining stocks. Lower bond yields are supportive of stocks, with the 10-year T-note yield falling to a 1-week low of 4.10% today.\nMore News from Barchart Santa Claus Rally, Fed Minutes and Other Can't Miss Items this Week\nMicron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMP Materials Gained 230% in 2025.

The recent surge in both metals has taken prices to overbought levels, sparking technical selling. Also, the CME today raised margin levels for precious metals trading, which has sparked some long liquidation pressure.\nCrude oil prices are up by more than +2% today, lifting energy producers and limiting losses in the broader market, as advanced peace talks over the weekend to end the Ukraine-Russian war failed to yield a breakthrough. Geopolitical tensions from Venezuela to Nigeria are also supporting crude prices. In addition, crude prices rose after China's Ministry of Finance on Sunday pledged to broaden its fiscal spending base next year, signaling government support to drive economic growth.\n\nSeasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.\nMarket attention this holiday-shortened week will focus on US economic news. Later today, Nov pending home sales are expected to climb +1.0% m/m. On Tuesday, the Dec MNI Chicago PMI is expected to rise by +3.5 points to 39.8. Also, the minutes of the December 9-10 FOMC meeting will be released. On Wednesday, initial weekly unemployment claims are expected to increase by 1,000 to 215,000. On Friday, the Dec S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unrevised at 51.8.\n\nStory Continues\nThe markets are discounting the odds at 19% for a -25 bp rate cut at the FOMC's next meeting on January 27-28.\nOverseas stock markets are mixed today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.17%. China's Shanghai Composite climbed to a 6-week high and closed up +0.04% for the ninth consecutive daily gain. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.44%.\n\nInterest Rates\nMarch 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) today are up by +4 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.6 bp to 4.112%. Mar T-notes rose to a 1-week high today, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1-week low of 4.102%. Today's stock market weakness is boosting safe-haven demand for T-notes. Also, geopolitical risks in Venezuela and Nigeria have added to the safe-haven appeal of T-notes.\nEuropean government bond yields are moving lower today. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.836% and is down -1.4 bp at 2.848%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-week low of 4.459% and is down -0.7 bp to 4.500%.\nSwaps are discounting a 2% chance of a +25 bp rate hike by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.\n\nUS Stock Movers\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly lower today, pressuring the broader market.

The benchmark S&P is up over 17%, and the blue-chip Dow has climbed over 14%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has led gains, adding over 22% so far — even after briefly entering a bear market in April after the rollout of President Trump's most sweeping tariffs .\nAnother relatively sleepy week will greet investors heading into the new year. A read on pending home sales is on the docket Monday. But the highlight of the week will likely come Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting earlier this month .\nThe minutes could add fresh insight for investors looking for clues on the Fed's next move in January, with the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 likely to continue into the new year .

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ( CL=F ), the US benchmark, picked up 2.4% to land above $58.\n\nIn comments at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, President Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said substantial progress has been made toward reaching a deal to end the conflict in Ukraine, though several issues remain open questions. Kyiv and Moscow also have yet to make progress on the issue of concessions over land captured by Russia during the conflict.\nSanctions from the US Treasury Department seeking to curtail Russia's ability to sell its oil internationally are likely to remain in place until a peace agreement is reached. The sanctions are likely keeping several hundred thousand barrels of oil off the market, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, even as Russia continues to find buyers in China and India willing to take Russian barrels at a steep discount.\nAt the same time, a monthly decline in output reported by Kazakhstan and escalating rhetoric from Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have put upward pressure on prices from the Middle East.\nKazakhstan's massive Tengiz oilfield, where Chevron ( CVX ) serves as the lead operator, led a decline of 6% in monthly output in December after attacks by Ukrainian drones damaged a Russian export terminal on the Black Sea, according to Reuters.\nProduction also fell in the Tengiz field in December, according to Reuters, even as Chevron has spent the year working on a nearly $50 billion effort to increase production in the field by roughly 1 million barrels per day.\nOil is headed for its fifth straight monthly decline as December comes to a close.\n\n35 mins ago Laura Bratton\n\nStocks slip at the open US stocks pulled back at the market open on Monday, dampening hopes for a so-called \"Santa Claus\" rally — the historic upturn in stocks during the last five trading days of December and first two sessions in January.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led declines at the open of Monday's session, falling 0.7%, as Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) dropped more than 2%.

L&F disclosed that a 3.83 trillion won supply contract announced in February 2023 has been revised down to 9.73 million won, citing a change in supply quantity. The reduction, amounting to roughly 99%, reflects how initial volume expectations have been reset as market and production assumptions evolved.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with KGFHF.\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe high-nickel cathode material covered by the contract was scheduled for delivery from January 2024 through this month and was intended for Cybertruck batteries, according to a person familiar with the matter. Actual shipments were limited as the Cybertruck's development was repeatedly postponed, while some consumers possibly opted for other Tesla models such as the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle. The person added that broader policy and economic factors, including the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, also weighed on the final supply outcome.\nL&F said the contract revision was unavoidable as schedules were adjusted in line with changes in the global electric-vehicle market and battery supply conditions, while stressing that there have been no changes to shipments of its flagship high-nickel product to other customers. The company added that supplies to major Korean cell manufacturers continue to proceed smoothly. Following the disclosure, L&F shares dropped more than 6% after the close of regular trading in Seoul, though the stock remains up 16% this year, trailing the 76% gain in the Kospi Index.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The South Korean corporation could not explain the dramatic drop. The 2023 agreement covered Tesla and its affiliates' high-nickel cathode materials from January 2024 to December 2025.Analysts and insiders say the supplies were for Tesla's 4680 battery cells, used mostly in the Cybertruck. Tesla needs less cathode materials since 4680 battery production is slower than projected. Sales of the Cybertruck have also lagged. Tesla admitted scaling issues with the 4680 battery architecture and a new dry electrode production method.L&F and Tesla did not reply to calls for comment. Analysts said the contract drop indicates technical issues and a worldwide electric car demand slump. As automakers cut EV investment plans, South Korean battery producers have cancelled orders and pulled down cooperation. The withdrawal followed policy uncertainty and U.S. electric vehicle subsidy expiry.Investors will examine Tesla's earnings and production updates for battery output objectives and demand patterns, while L&F's forecast will show how the altered deal impacts revenue.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In late December, Chief Executive Elon Musk said he had tested the service without a safety monitor, raising speculation about faster regulatory progress.\nFurther expansion remains uncertain.

Following President Donald Trump's election last year, the stock came into 2025 riding high, as investors believed that CEO Elon Musk's ties to the president would make life easier for Tesla, especially on the regulatory front.\nHowever, Tesla struggled earlier this year due to a variety of factors, including weak electric vehicle sales, and as investors anticipated the expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which is expected to hurt EV demand. Musk also proved controversial, due to his involvement with the initiative called the Department of Government Efficiency and public arguments with Trump.\nHowever, the stock has rebounded thanks to investor enthusiasm surrounding Tesla's full self-driving technology, the launch of the company's robotaxi fleet, and excitement about other artificial intelligence initiatives, such as Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots. The stock is up close to 28% on the year as I write this. Is Tesla still a millionaire maker?\n\nContinues to be a battleground stock Tesla remains a battleground stock on Wall Street. Some believe the stock, trading at 296 times forward earnings estimates, is wildly overvalued. Others, like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, believe investors can still get in on the ground floor of what could ultimately prove to be one of the most innovative AI companies in the world.\n\nWood has a 2029 price target of $2,600 per share for Tesla. That implies 436% upside from the Dec. 25 price. To make $1 million in this scenario, one would need to invest $230,000 now, a huge chunk of money for someone not already a millionaire. But even if it takes 20 years for Wood's prediction to be correct, that would still be a good investment.\nI'm personally in the bear camp and think that Tesla is overvalued, but the jury is still out on the stock. Regardless, it would take a big bet to become a millionaire.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This material was intended for use in Cybertruck batteries, according to a Bloomberg report on Monday that cited a person familiar with the matter.\nOnly minimal material was delivered as Cybertruck development faced repeated delays. Consumers instead opted for other Tesla vehicles, including the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle.\nThe supply agreement was also impacted by broader policy and economic factors, including the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, the report added.\nRelated articles\nTesla supplier sees 99% cut in battery material contract amid Cybertruck woes\nSilver's Bullish Pattern Points Higher — Keep an Eye on $52 Resistance Zone\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy in January That Could Issue Stock Splits in 2026\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:46 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nAPP\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points ASML's share price has crossed the $1,000 threshold as AI fuels demand for its EUV systems.\nAppLovin's rampant growth has positioned the stock for its first-ever split.\nTesla has run to another high on optimism for humanoid robotics.\n10 stocks we like better than ASML ›\nInvestors tend to see more companies issue stock splits when the market is doing well, and share prices are high. A stock split is the corporate version of taking a pie and cutting it into smaller, equal-sized slices. The pie remains the same size, but there are more slices, and each represents a smaller portion of the pie.\n\nA stock split lowers a stock's share price, but it doesn't change any of its valuations or business fundamentals. Investors tend to applaud stock splits because they usually occur after a stock has performed well, and having more shares makes it easier to buy and sell.\nIt's been a fantastic year for many growth stocks across the market. ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) , AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have risen by 54%, 125%, and 20% respectively, in 2025.\nHere is why each stock is a potential buy and stock split candidate in 2026.\n1. ASML ASML plays a crucial role in semiconductor manufacturing as the only company that builds extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which etch complex designs on silicon wafers using light and are vital components in the manufacture of the most advanced semiconductor chipsets. The ongoing artificial intelligence boom is driving demand for ASML's EUV systems. The stock has been volatile at times. ASML became entangled in some geopolitical tensions between the United States and China over access to its machinery. Still, there is now sufficient clarity that management is guiding for 7.6% to 13.3% annualized revenue growth through 2030.\nThe stock isn't cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of 36 times full-year earnings estimates, but that's because analysts estimate ASML will grow earnings by over 22% annually for the next three to five years. ASML's last stock split occurred over a decade ago, and its shares have since skyrocketed higher. Trading at over $1,000 per share today, ASML seems ripe for a stock split in 2026.\n\n2. AppLovin Mobile phones have become a massive market, with billions of people using smartphones and various applications every day. AppLovin's business caters to these smartphone users, and it has soared in recent years, as has the company's stock. AppLovin offers software tools that help mobile app and game developers target, acquire, and monetize users. The company went public amid a market bubble in 2021. Yet, the stock has still risen by 1,000% over its lifetime.\n\nStory Continues\nAppLovin is currently one of the fastest-growing companies on the stock market. Revenue increased by a whopping 68% to $1.4 billion last quarter. The stock is priced accordingly at 78 times full-year earnings estimates, but it has room to grow into that valuation. Grand View Research estimates the mobile ad-tech market could approach $1 trillion by 2030. The stock now trades at over $700 per share, making it a prime candidate for its first-ever stock split.\n\n3. Tesla Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla remains a controversial stock. Shares trade near all-time highs despite the company's core vehicle business slowing. Why? CEO Elon Musk has Tesla leaning into a colossal humanoid robotics opportunity. With its humanoid, Tesla Optimus, the company aims to take an early lead in what some researchers believe will ultimately become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity, worth as much as $5 trillion worldwide by 2050.\nTesla's slumping vehicle sales and a sky-high price-to-earnings ratio of 300 times full-year earnings estimates can be hard pills to swallow. That's understandable. That said, Tesla has long been a story stock, a bet on Elon Musk, which has (so far) produced life-changing investment returns for shareholders over time. Tesla has split its stock multiple times in its history. Shares currently trade at nearly $500, which could prompt the company to issue another split sooner rather than later.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?

      "Content": "Is Lucid Group Stock Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire?\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LCID\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Upstart EV maker Lucid has just introduced a mid-size version of its all-electric SUV.\nLucid's production is growing quickly, but it is still far below that of other auto makers.\nThe company was able to increase its access to capital, but still has limited room to run.\n10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›\n\nInvestors who miss out on a huge investment opportunity often look for similar companies that have the potential to do well, too. That's exactly the story in the electric vehicle space, with Tesla being the huge missed opportunity and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) being a similar company with potential. Only potential isn't enough to make a stock a good investment.\nIs Lucid stock your ticket to becoming a millionaire, or is it too far behind in the electric vehicle (EV) space to catch up? The risk versus reward balance here is tilted materially in one direction.\nThe big news about Lucid Lucid makes highly respected EVs with award-winning technology. To be sure, that's a great foundation for the business. The problem is that, like Tesla before it, the company has started at the high end of the auto market . There are only so many customers capable of buying expensive cars. The most recent launch from the company, the Lucid Gravity Touring, is no exception.\nThis mid-size SUV starts at a hefty $79,000. Lucid has plans to start selling lower-priced vehicles, a path that is similar to that taken by Tesla. So there are reasons to be excited about Lucid's future. However, there's a lot more competition in the EV market today than there was when Tesla essentially created the EV category.\n\nBeing able to build a sustainably profitable business is far from a slam dunk for Lucid. In fact, while the new model is exciting, it may be too little, too late, given that EV sales have been weak since government subsidies were halted. Lucid may have simply missed the window of opportunity, and it may not have what it takes to remain a stand-alone business.\nThe income statement, the balance sheet, and production The first big problem is the income statement, which is mired in red ink. Lucid is a start-up building a business in a capital-intensive industry, so losses are to be expected. However, a company can only lose money for so long before it can no longer be sustained. The losses are expected to persist for the foreseeable future, making the balance sheet particularly important.\n\nThe balance sheet, however, is equally concerning. Without getting too deep into the numbers, Lucid started 2025 stating that it has enough liquidity to last until the first half of 2026. After a recent funding round, the company now believes it has enough liquidity to last until the first half of 2027. That's meant to assuage investor concerns about the company's access to capital.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, 2026 is around the corner, and this money-losing business is basically telling investors that it has a year to a year-and-a-half of money left. Unless you are an aggressive growth investor, that should be more than enough to keep you watching from the sidelines.\nThe other significant issue here is that Lucid's production is relatively modest by industry standards. The company highlighted in the third quarter of 2025 that its production is up materially from a year ago, rising by 116%. That's great, but it still only produced around 4,000 vehicles (generously rounding up). Tesla produced 447,000 vehicles (rounding down). Lucid simply doesn't have the scale it needs to compete effectively at this point.\n\nLucid has the tech, but it is high-risk To be fair, Lucid has attractive technology. That could be enough of an edge to break into the highly competitive auto industry. So there is a chance that an investment here could help you build a seven-figure nest egg. The problem is that Lucid has a long road ahead before it is likely to become sustainably profitable.\n\nThere are significant risks to consider, notably its ability to raise the cash it needs to continue supporting its money-losing business. Ultimately, only the most aggressive investors will be inclined to consider Lucid. And even then, the risk-reward balance seems highly skewed toward the negative.\nShould you buy stock in Lucid Group right now? Before you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lucid Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nCondiciones y Política de privacidad\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Sources and ‌analysts said L&F had planned to supply the key materials for Tesla's in-house batteries known as 4680 cells.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled a plan in 2020 to mass-produce the 4680, a less expensive battery that he said would help it make a small, compelling $25,000 electric car that was fully autonomous within about three years from then.\nHowever, as EV ⁠demand slowed and Tesla struggled to ‌ramp up production and development of the 4680 cells, the company ultimately did not need as much cathode material from L&F as initially anticipated, analysts said.\nNeither Tesla nor L&F ‍immediately responded to Reuters' requests for comments.\nTesla currently uses the 4680 batteries in its slow-selling Cybertruck EVs, which have proved a major disappointment despite Musk’s prediction of hundreds of thousands of annual sales.\nMusk has also admitted it will be a challenge ​to scale up a new battery process called dry electrode used to make the cells.\n\nORDER CANCELLATION\nCho Hyun-ryul, ‌a senior analyst at Samsung Securities, said issues with production yields of Tesla's 4680 batteries and a slowdown in EV demand growth could have affected the reduction in orders from L&F. \"There (is) anxiety about the battery sector overall,\" he added.\nSome battery suppliers have reported order cancellations and ended or scaled down joint ventures with General Motors and Ford Motor following the end of U.S. federal subsidies for electric vehicles in September.\nIn recent weeks, South Korea's ⁠battery industry has come under mounting pressure as automakers scale back ​EV plans amid policy uncertainty and weakening demand.\nLG Energy Solution is ​set to lose about 13.5 trillion won ($9.41 billion) in expected revenue due to termination of battery supply deals from Ford and Freudenberg Battery Power Systems, more than half of its ‍25.62 trillion won in revenue ⁠last year.\n\nAnother South Korean battery maker, SK On, said this month it has decided to end its joint venture with Ford for their battery factories in the U.S.\nFord said it would take a $19.5 ⁠billion writedown and scrap several electric vehicle models, a dramatic example of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to ‌the Trump administration's policies and weakening EV demand.\n\nStory Continues\n($1 = 1,435.0100 won)\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang; ‌Editing by Christopher Cushing, Tom Hogue and Jan Harvey)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) has amassed a market cap of $1.6 trillion, making it the most valuable automaker in the world today, far exceeding the combined market capitalization of automakers like Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM ), BYD Co. Ltd. (OTC: BYDDY ) (OTC: BYDDF ) and more.\nIf you're curious about what the stock returns would be on TSLA if you invested $5,000 in the EV giant back during Christmas in 2020, here's how much you could've made.\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nTesla Stock Movements Since Dec. 24, 2020, Tesla stock has experienced record highs but also some sharp lows. If you invested $5,000 in Tesla around Christmas five years ago, when the stock was at approximately $220.59, it would buy you 22.66 shares in the company.\nBased on Tesla's Pre-Market trading figure, according to Benzinga Pro data as of December 23, 2025, where the stock is trading at $490.49, your investment today would be somewhere around $11111, a positive return of over 122% with a profit of $6111 on your initial investment.\n\nTesla, during the last five years, has hit a low of $101.81 on January 6, 2023, and recently hit a high of $498.83 on December 22, 2025.\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nTesla's Falling Sales Tesla, despite its valuation, has been reporting consistently declining sales this year, with the latest figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) showcasing a 28% YoY decline in the automaker's YTD sales in Europe, along with an almost 12% decline in sales during November. Tesla's rival BYD, on the other hand, surged almost 222% in November.\n\nThe lackluster sales come despite electrified vehicles (Hybrids, EVs and PHEVs) reporting a growth in the region and accounting for almost 63% of the total car sales in the region.\nShareholders Approve Trillion-Dollar Pay Package Tesla shareholders in November voted overwhelmingly in favor of a trillion-dollar pay package for Musk, which would reward Musk with compensation as the automaker hits crucial goals outlined by the Board of Directors in the pay package. However, it's worth noting that Musk could still pocket billions of dollars by hitting some of the relatively easier targets.\n\nMusk also received a major boost as a court in Delaware reversed its decision to void Musk's $56 billion pay package approved by investors in 2018. With the package now restored, Musk could gain over 18.1% stake in the company's expanded share base should he choose to exercise the stock options related to the 2018 compensation award.\n\nStory Continues\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

      "Content": "China's BYD poised to overtake Tesla in 2025 EV sales\n\nElodie Mazein and AFP correspondents in Beijing\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 5:22 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\nGrowing Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company in annual sales.\nThe two groups are expected soon to publish their final figures for 2025, and based on sales data so far this year, there is almost no chance the American company led by Elon Musk will retain its leadership position.\n\nAt the end of November, Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, had sold 2.07 million EVs so far in 2025.\nTesla, for its part, had sold 1.22 million by the end of September.\nTesla's September figures included a one-time boost in sales, to nearly half-a-million vehicles in a three-month period, before the expiration of a US tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles -- which ended under legislation backed by President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic.\nBut Tesla's sales in the coming quarter are expected to fall to 449,000, according to a FactSet analysis consensus. That would give Tesla about 1.65 million sales for all of 2025, a drop of 7.7 percent and well below the level BYD had attained by end November.\nDeutsche Bank, which projects just 405,000 Tesla EV sales during the fourth quarter, sees the company's sales down by around one-third in both North America and Europe, and by one-tenth in China.\n\n- Transition period -\nIndustry watchers say it will take time for EV demand to reach a level of equilibrium in the United States following the elimination of the $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025.\nEven prior to that, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of Trump and other far-right politicians. Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies and from European giants.\n\"We believe Tesla will see some weakness on deliveries\" in the fourth quarter, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.\nSales of 420,000 would be \"good enough to show stable demand,\" with Wall Street \"laser focused on the autonomous chapter kicking off in 2026,\" Ives added, referring to plans for self-driving vehicles.\n\nEven as it has grown quickly, BYD has faced challenges in its home market.\nWith profitability in China weighed down by price-wary consumers, the company has sought to strengthen its foothold in foreign markets.\nBYD is \"one of the pioneers to establish overseas production capacity and supply chains for EVs,\" Jing Yang, Director of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings, told AFP.\n\"Going forward, its geographical diversification is likely to help it to navigate an increasingly complicated global tariff environment,\" said Yang.\n\nStory Continues\nOverseas rivals to BYD have balked at Chinese state subsidies and other state supports that have allowed the company to sell vehicles cheaply.\nTrump's predecessor Joe Biden imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports that could potentially go even higher under Trump. Europe has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, but BYD is building manufacturing capacity in Hungary.\n\nWhile the chance of Tesla reclaiming its global leadership in EVs looks uncertain, the American company is also potentially positioned for growth.\nMichaeli of TD Cowen sees autonomous technology playing an increasingly important role for Tesla, with breakthroughs in its \"full self-driving\" or \"FSD\" offerings potentially boosting sales.\n\"As Tesla really begins to roll out eyes-off features and expand FSDs capability, if they do that successfully, that should generate more demand for their vehicles,\" Michaeli said.\nMusk has said the Cybercab, an autonomous robotaxi model, will begin production in April 2026. The company has also unveiled lower-priced versions of the Models 3 and Y that could boost sales.\nbur-elm/msp\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Next Stock-Split Stock That Could Make You Rich\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:11 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is trading at a price where big tech peers have announced stock splits.\nIf Meta splits its stock, it could benefit from increased liquidity and broader investor participation.\nWith nearly 3.5 billion daily active users and aggressive capital investments in AI infrastructure, the company’s core digital advertising business continues to grow at an impressive pace.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have soared 443% over the past three years, closing at $661.50 on Dec. 22. At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "2026 will be 'year of autonomous': Analyst on Tesla, Waymo robotaxis\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: LYFT\n\nTSLA\n\nUBER\n\nGOOG\n\n2026 is on the road to being the \"year of autonomous\" driving as Tesla ( TSLA ) and the Alphabet-owned Waymo ( GOOG , GOOGL ) seek to expand their robotaxi services to other major US cities.\nWedbush Securities managing director of equity research Scott Devitt weighs in on the biggest themes and investing plays around self-driving technology, and how he sees 2026 playing out for rideshare companies Uber ( UBER ) and Lyft ( LYFT ).\n\nCatch Scott Devitt's top three consumer internet stock picks heading into 2026.\nAlso watch Yahoo Finance's interview with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign associate professor Katherine Driggs-Campbell about the recent behavior shifts in autonomous vehicles' driving habits\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nSo talk to me a little bit about how you're seeing these themes going into 2026. Robo taxi, AI.\n00:10 Speaker B\nAutonomous is going to be it's going to be the year of autonomous. You know, frankly, particularly in the US with the expansion of Waymo into uh as many as 20 markets in 2026. Our estimate for uh Tesla is that it it enters 30 US markets by the end of 2026 and you're beginning to really see the early stages of a transition from uh human human-driven activity to one that's run by robots. and it's very exciting. It's good for society, it's good for um the health of consumers given that it lowers traffic uh deaths and uh and incidence rates. And so I think autonomous is something that could be a headwind for companies I cover, Lyft and Uber in some ways. Um could be beneficial in other ways and certainly will will be good for Waymo and Tesla. On the AI side, you know, a lot of the the benefits the past two to three years in terms of security prices have come with infrastructure plays. I think you're going to start to see a transition more towards use cases, the enterprise and consumer use cases. And um, you know, these things kind of being found in the wild now and starting to see the ability to quantify uh the returns. Meta's been an early beneficiary of incorporation of AI into the business. I think you'll see more companies as well in 26.\n02:08 Speaker A\nAnd looking at Lyft and Uber, I mean, Uber has done well this year. Uh and I'm curious, is that because of robo taxi uh and and how you see the competition between some of these players uh shaking out? I mean, you've got Waymo that has done so well, and then you've got Tesla that is also making advancements and Tesla which touched all-time highs this year. So I I guess I'm just curious as to how you see it all shaking out within those players.\n02:44 Speaker B\nSo Uber and the performance year to date, it's a little tricky because it did underperform exiting 2024 on fears of autonomous and then recovered this year as it, you know, as autonomous has has been, you know, uh held at bay and hasn't really impacted anyone's business quite yet. And so I I think that that that performance looked over an extended period of time called the next 18 months, Uber's been relatively flat. You know, I think Uber as a company is a bit more insulated than Lyft because it has a delivery business for restaurants as well, which is about half of the gross bookings, and also has a significant business outside the US. In the US, you know, autonomous is ramping quickly and I think it's going only going to accelerate on an S-curve type uh pattern in 2026 and that really exposes Lyft which has over 90% of its gross bookings in the US and and so I think that you're going to start to see the effects of that in the share price which has also done well um this year in 25 could come to an end in 26.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Santa Claus Rally, Fed Minutes and Other Can't Miss Items this Week\n\nGavin McMaster\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMarkets enter the final week of 2025 with focus on the traditional \"Santa Claus Rally\" period that historically sees stocks gain during the last five trading days of December and first two days of January. The week features an abbreviated trading calendar with markets closed Thursday for New Year's Day and light volume expected throughout as institutional participation remains reduced following the Christmas break. Tuesday's FOMC meeting minutes will provide the only major catalyst, offering detailed insights into the Federal Reserve's December policy deliberations and the internal debates that shaped the more hawkish 2026 outlook. Economic data remains sparse with Wednesday's initial jobless claims and Chicago PMI before the holiday, followed by Friday's Manufacturing PMI providing the first economic snapshot of 2026. The week also brings heightened attention to Tesla (TSLA) as CEO Elon Musk's year-end deadline approaches for delivering unsupervised robotaxis in Austin, Texas—a promise that could prove consequential for the stock despite Musk's decade-long history of overly optimistic self-driving timelines.\n\nHere are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.\nMore News from Barchart The Next Market Collapse Will Be Quiet And That Is Exactly Why Investors Will Miss It\nNvidia Stock Is ‘Ripe’ for Gains in 2026, According to This Top Analyst\nThe Saturday Spread: Using Risk Topography to Plan Your Options Strategies (JD, NTAP, ZS)\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nSanta Claus Rally Dynamics and Year-End Positioning\nThe traditional Santa Claus Rally period encompasses the final five trading days of 2025 (December 26, 29, 30, 31, and January 2) and represents one of the most closely watched seasonal patterns in market history. Since 1969, the S&P 500 ($SPX) (SPY) has averaged gains of 1.3% during this seven-day period, with positive returns occurring roughly 78% of the time. The phenomenon is attributed to various factors including year-end portfolio adjustments, tax-loss harvesting completion, pension fund rebalancing, and general holiday optimism. However, this year faces headwinds from the Fed's more hawkish December meeting, persistent inflation concerns, and recent technology sector weakness following disappointing AI infrastructure earnings. Light volume during the period can amplify moves in either direction, making technical levels less reliable while creating potential for momentum-driven rallies or selloffs with limited fundamental justification. Historically, years where the Santa Claus Rally fails to materialize have often preceded weaker performance in the following year, making this week's price action potentially significant for early 2026 sentiment. Window-dressing activity by fund managers seeking to show winning positions in year-end reports may provide technical support for market leaders.\n\nStory Continues\nFOMC Minutes: Decoding the Hawkish Shift\nTuesday's FOMC meeting minutes at 2:00pm represent the week's most important fundamental catalyst, providing detailed insights into the Federal Reserve's December deliberations that resulted in a rate cut coupled with fewer projected cuts for 2026. The minutes will be scrutinized for any discussion about the conditions that would warrant pausing the cutting cycle, concerns about persistent inflation, and assessments of labor market resilience that shaped the more cautious outlook. Investors will search for clues about the internal debate among Fed officials, particularly any dissenting views about the December cut or disagreements about the 2026 policy path. The minutes may reveal how policymakers are weighing conflicting economic signals, including sticky inflation against labor market softening and consumer spending resilience. Any commentary about financial conditions, asset price levels, or concerns about reigniting inflation through excessive accommodation could influence market expectations for the pace of future policy adjustments. The release during a holiday-shortened week with reduced liquidity creates potential for amplified reactions to any hawkish or dovish revelations, particularly if the minutes contradict or significantly expand on Chair Powell's press conference messaging.\n\nTesla's Robotaxi Deadline and Autonomous Driving Reality\nThe year-end arrival brings intense focus on Tesla (TSLA) as CEO Elon Musk's deadline approaches for delivering unsupervised robotaxis in Austin, Texas—a promise that represents his most specific self-driving timeline despite a decade of missed predictions. Musk has raised the stakes by committing to such a near-term deliverable rather than using his typical \"this year\" or \"next year\" language that allows for perpetual postponement. Any successful demonstration of truly unsupervised autonomous operation would represent a watershed moment for Tesla's valuation thesis and the broader autonomous vehicle industry, potentially validating the company's massive investments in Full Self-Driving technology. However, skepticism remains high given Musk's track record of overly optimistic timelines and the significant regulatory, safety, and technical hurdles that remain for Level 4 autonomous operation. Even if Tesla demonstrates some form of unsupervised operation in a limited Austin geofence, questions will immediately arise about scalability, regulatory approval pathways, and commercialization timelines. The market's reaction to any announcements or lack thereof will provide important signals about investor willingness to continue valuing Tesla's autonomous ambitions at premium multiples heading into 2026.\n\nEconomic Indicators and 2026 Setup\nWednesday's initial jobless claims and Chicago PMI before the New Year's Day holiday will provide final 2025 economic data points, while Friday's Manufacturing PMI represents the first economic snapshot of 2026. The Chicago PMI has historically served as a reliable indicator of national ISM Manufacturing trends and will offer insights into industrial sector conditions and pricing pressures as the year concludes. Initial jobless claims continue tracking labor market health amid ongoing questions about employment momentum and the sustainability of consumer spending. Friday's Manufacturing PMI will be closely watched for any signs of industrial sector strengthening or deterioration entering the new year, with particular focus on new orders and employment components that provide forward-looking perspectives. The sparse economic calendar reflects the holiday period but these few releases will help establish baseline expectations for January's more comprehensive data. Any significant surprises could influence early 2026 positioning as institutional participants return from holiday breaks and begin implementing new year strategies based on evolving economic fundamentals.\n\nTransition Week: 2025 Review and 2026 Outlook\nThe year-end week provides natural opportunity to assess 2025's market performance and establish frameworks for 2026 positioning. Technology stocks, particularly AI-related infrastructure plays, have driven much of the year's gains despite recent volatility raising questions about sustainability. The Federal Reserve successfully transitioned from hiking to cutting while avoiding recession, though persistent inflation and the more cautious 2026 outlook create uncertainty about the policy path ahead. Key themes likely to dominate early 2026 include AI monetization and return on investment, inflation trajectory and Fed policy response, consumer spending resilience amid economic uncertainties, and geopolitical developments including potential trade policy shifts. The light volume environment during this transition week means meaningful price discovery will be limited until institutional participation returns in early January. Investors should use this period to review portfolio positioning, assess risk exposures, and develop strategic frameworks for navigating 2026's opportunities and challenges rather than reacting to potentially meaningless holiday-period price fluctuations in thin markets.\nBest of luck this week and don't forget to check out my daily options article.\nOn the date of publication, Gavin McMaster had a position in: SPY.

      "Content": "How Much It Really Costs To Own a Tesla vs. a Toyota Over 10 Years\n\nNicholas Morine\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:41 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTM\n\nHMC\n\nWith Tesla pushing hard into the more affordable vehicle market in attempt to counteract the end of the federal EV tax credit, as Electrek detailed, the question of whether it’s actually more affordable to drop a bit more on a Tesla than more traditional vehicle brands (such as, for example Honda or Toyota) comes to the fore.\n\nPitting Toyota versus Tesla has never seem more ripe a comparison as EVs compete against traditional internal combustion engines (ICE) and hybrid models, and the primary question most have in mind is: How much does it actually cost to run both for a decade? Let’s take a look at the numbers.\nRead More: Which Cars Last Longest? Ranking 32 Brands\nFind Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nBaseline Cost Assumptions and Annual Driving Ranges To set the standard, we’ll assume that drivers are racking up 12,000 miles a year (or 120,000 miles over the course of the decade), that electricity will cost 17.6 cents per kWh (per the EIA ), and that gasoline will cost a U.S. average of $3.10 a gallon (according to the same source ). Depreciation and insurance numbers are drawn from the latest AAA Your Driving Costs report for 2025 .\n\n2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD Concerning the Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, the stated fuel economy measures out to 26 kWh per 100 miles of range, meaning that a total of 312,000 kWh would be necessary over 10 years of use. At today’s energy costs, that comes out to about $5,497, not accounting for any loss of energy during the charging process.\n\nAAA figures the 10-year total cost of operation (TCO), inclusive of the gas figures above in addition to depreciation, maintenance and insurance, at $55,714 for the Tesla Model 3 LR AWD.\n2024 Toyota bZ4X FWD Toyota’s smaller EV SUV might be a little more expensive to operate than it’s closest Tesla competitor, but not by much. With an average fuel economy of 28 kWh per 100 miles of operation, the cost to drive this Japanese import 120,000 miles over a decade evens out to about $5,920.\nAAA’s numbers point to a 10-year TCO of $56,662 for the Toyota bZ4X, slightly higher than the Tesla alternative.\n\n2025 Toyota Corolla The Toyota Corolla is perhaps one of the most iconic ICE vehicles to hit the roads since its U.S. debut in 1968, but can it hold its own against the newcomer EVs in terms of operating costs ?\nWith an average mileage pegged at 36 mpg by Edmunds , gas is definitely going to outpace electricity in terms of fuel costs — the Corolla is estimated to cost drivers $1,033 per year, or $10,333 over a decade, at the pump.\nHowever: AAA’s fact sheet figures can be used to determine a decade-spanning TCO of $52,218 for the 2025 Corolla, coming in slightly under the EV alternatives.\n\nStory Continues\nFor a more broad-based snapshot based on categories rather than brands, consider figures from AAA. They suggest that it costs $13,692 per year to own a medium EV sedan versus $9,956 per year to own a medium ICE sedan, based on 15,000 miles driven. The largest portion of discrepancy is the very steep depreciation curve for EVs at this point in time.\n\nOn SUVs, the numbers are much closer — $12,710 per year for an electric medium SUV, and $12,584 per year for a medium ICE SUV. The above AAA figures include depreciation, insurance, fuel, maintenance, financing charges, and licensing, registration and taxes.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nTrump's $2K Dividend: Who Qualifies and How You'll Get It\nElon Musk Predicts 'Universal High Income' Will Pay For Everything -- How Much Would You Get?\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : How Much It Really Costs To Own a Tesla vs. a Toyota Over 10 Years\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $2 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTSLA\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom each have market caps around $1.6 trillion.\nAI is the driving force behind all three stock prices.\nOne of these tech leaders is seeing immediate results from AI spending, and its stock valuation is more attractive right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is responsible for adding trillions of dollars in value to a handful of companies over the last few years. Nvidia , for example, briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year, thanks to its dominant position in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). Four other companies sit firmly above the $2 trillion threshold as we approach the new year.\nBut three AI stocks currently have similar market caps around $1.6 trillion as of this writing, and are vying to become the first new $2 trillion company of 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Here's my prediction for the next company to top the milestone, and it could come as soon as next year.\nArtificial intelligence is fueling all three Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom have all seen their stock prices heavily influenced by advances in AI this year.\nMeta stock climbed higher early in the year as its efforts to improve its recommendation algorithms bore fruit. Ad revenue climbed higher as time spent on its apps increased, and ads became more effective. However, the stock took a step back recently as management shared plans to increase its AI-related spending.\n\nTesla's value is heavily tied to its robotaxi service and AI innovations. The stock received a boost over the summer when it launched its robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas. Investors added to those gains on promising progress on the company's next-generation AI chip for its vehicles.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator business has gained momentum in 2025, as the company signed big contracts with OpenAI and Anthropic, the latter of which is buying Alphabet 's Broadcom-designed tensor processing units (TPUs). To that end, Alphabet and Broadcom are seeing excellent progress in shifting more developer workloads to TPUs, which offer greater energy efficiency and cost savings versus Nvidia's GPUs.\nBroadcom stock took a step back after its last earnings report, as many analysts were disappointed with management's expectation that greater AI chip sales would come at a lower gross margin.\nWhile all three of these stocks have a path to a $2 trillion valuation in 2026, I expect Meta Platforms to reach the milestone first. Here's why.\n\nStory Continues\nAI-powered earnings growth at an attractive valuation Even with its run rate of $200 billion in annual revenue, Meta is still growing its bottom line quickly. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 20% in the third quarter, and improvements in AI are the reason.\nMeta has seen an increase in both ad impressions and price per ad for eight straight quarters. That indicates that it's increasing user engagement and opening new places within its apps for advertising while making ads more effective.\n\nManagement attributes a shift in its recommendation algorithm to make it more general across formats as the primary reason users are spending more time on its apps. Meta has seen similar improvements by applying the same methodology to its advertising algorithm. In other words, bigger models have directly translated into more revenue.\nThat trend should continue in 2026, as Meta opens up more opportunities for advertising, including on Threads and WhatsApp. It could also begin monetizing Meta AI, its generative AI chatbot. The improvements in its algorithms over the last couple of years should enable it to ramp up advertising quickly without as much negative impact on its pricing as we've seen in the past.\nThe bigger opportunity for Meta in 2026, though, may be the expansion of its generative AI features. It's reportedly working on an AI agent that can manage advertising campaigns for small businesses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly talks about the opportunity to handle everything involved with creating, testing, and optimizing ad campaigns on its platform through an AI agent.\n\nAnd chatbots specializing in sales and customer service for a company could open the door for more businesses to push Facebook and Instagram users to start messaging them through Meta's chat apps.\nWith small- and medium-sized businesses accounting for the bulk of advertisers on Meta's platform, these innovations have the potential to dramatically increase the amount they're willing to spend on ads. If the overhead for these clients is much lower, they can increase their ad spending and scale up their businesses faster.\nThose efforts should fuel another year of strong revenue growth. And while depreciation expense from the increase in AI-related capital expenditures could eat into earnings growth, Meta should be able to manage continued improvements in earnings per share with the help of share repurchases.\n\nThe stock trades for just 26 times forward earnings expectations, which is much lower than Broadcom's multiple and less than one-tenth the multiple Tesla stock trades for. I expect Meta to fetch a higher earnings multiple as it proves its AI spending to be well worth it once again in 2026, pushing its valuation to $2 trillion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "As Tesla Faces a New Investigation Over Door Safety, How Should You Play TSLA Stock Heading into 2026?\n\nNauman Khan\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla (TSLA) is no longer just an automaker, it’s a market-moving technology name whose share price often swings on product news, regulatory headlines, and CEO sentiment.\nRecently, Tesla was again in the news after U.S. auto-safety regulators opened an investigation into about 179,000 Model 3 sedans following a consumer petition alleging that the mechanical emergency door release can be difficult to locate and use in emergencies. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the issue could pose safety risks if occupants are unable to exit the vehicle after a crash. The probe has pushed Tesla back into the regulatory spotlight just as its shares hover near record highs.\n\nMore News from Barchart Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\nAnalysts note that if a defect is confirmed, Tesla could face costly recalls or fixes, e.g., retrofitting clearer manual releases, which would weigh on near-term profits. This investigation ties into broader negative headlines, notably a lawsuit filed by victims’ families over a fatal 2016 Model S crash blamed on door-handle design.\n\nWith 2026 on the horizon, investors are now weighing whether this latest scrutiny is a short-term setback or a meaningful signal for how to position TSLA stock going forward.\nTesla Stock Performance Tesla remains one of the most closely watched growth stocks in the market, backed by its scale, brand strength, and long-term ambitions in AI, autonomy, and energy. Shares of Tesla have moved up and down a lot, as investor mood keeps changing. Even with this volatility, the electric-vehicle maker has still managed to deliver decent performance so far in 2025. Year-to-date (YTD) stock is up 17.67%. Investors cheered on record vehicle deliveries, strong free cash flow, optimism around robotaxis and AI initiatives, renewed confidence in Full Self-Driving, and enthusiasm following Elon Musk’s updated long-term vision.\n\nHowever, the main concern of analysts about Tesla is its valuation, which is significantly stretched compared to its sector peers. The Price to Earnings (P/E) non-GAAP forward ratio is 296.40, vastly higher than the sector median of 17.77, indicating that the stock is trading at nose-bleed levels. In short, TSLA trades at a steep premium, but bulls argue future technology like robotaxis and FSD justifies this premium, while skeptics see it as pricing in lofty, uncertain outcomes.\nTesla Delivered Mixed Q3 Tesla’s latest quarterly results for Q3 2025 showed strong deliveries and cash generation, even as profitability came under pressure.\n\nStory Continues\nRevenue reached about $28.1 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. Automotive sales contributed roughly $21.2 billion, while the energy storage business continued to shine with revenue of about $3.4 billion, and services brought in around $3.5 billion.\nNet income came in at $1.37 billion, down 37% year-over-year (YOY), reflecting higher costs and lower regulatory credit revenue.\n\nOperating cash flow remained strong at $6.24 billion, and after capital spending of $2.25 billion, free cash flow hit a record $3.99 billion. Tesla ended the quarter with about $41.6 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nManagement offered limited formal guidance, but CFO Vaibhav Taneja said capital spending is expected to be around $9 billion for 2025, with a larger increase planned in 2026 to support AI and expansion efforts.\nWall Street expects full-year 2025 revenue of roughly $94.9 billion and earnings of about $1.13 per share, pointing to continued pressure on profitability.\nStill, Elon Musk struck an optimistic tone, saying the company is laying the foundation for long-term growth. CFO Vaibhav Taneja highlighted progress on the “Year of the Y,” noting that multiple Model Y variants helped support demand and keep volumes resilient despite a challenging environment.\n\nHeadwinds Grow, Hopes Remain Tesla is navigating a challenging market as its U.S. retail sales plunged 23% in November to a near four-year low of 39,800 vehicles, despite introducing lower-priced “Standard” variants. Cox Automotive analysts warned that demand for these cheap trims cannibalized higher-margin models, highlighting waning consumer interest after federal credits ended.\n\nIn Europe, stiff competition also chipped away at Tesla’s market share. On the positive side, Tesla’s robotaxi program quietly expanded achieving driverless rides in Austin and regulatory fixes like labeling hidden door releases have been rolled out. However, public controversies – including Musk’s political comments – have drawn protests that analysts say hurt Tesla’s brand.\nWall Street Divided on Tesla Stock Perspective Wall Street analysts remain divided on TSLA. On the one side, bulls remained hopeful, but others showed caution on steep valuation.\nMorgan Stanley’s Andrew Percoco recently shifted Tesla to “Equal-Weight” but raised his price target to $425 from $410, saying the stock deserves a premium despite a choppy outlook.\n\nGoldman Sachs maintains a Neutral rating with a $400 target, noting progress in autonomous technology but warning that much optimism is already priced in.\nBullish firms like Wedbush continue to rate Tesla Outperform, with a $600 target, while Deutsche Bank recently upgraded the stock to “Buy” and lifted its target to $500.\nOverall, the consensus price target is $395.32, with a “Hold” rating from all 40 analysts covering Tesla. This means stock is trading much above its mean target and has 16.8% downside risk here. But the bulls' target of $600 shows a 26.27% upside if Tesla delivers stronger vehicle deliveries, improved margins, and progress on robotaxi and AI initiatives in 2026.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Peter Thiel and Larry Page are preparing to flee California in case the state passes a billionaire wealth tax, report says\n\nJason Ma\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 12:38 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nTech billionaires are making plans to bail on California ahead a possible ballot measure that would tax their assets to help pay for healthcare.\nSources told the New York Times that venture capitalist Peter Thiel has explored spending more time outside California and opening an office for his Los Angeles-based personal investment firm, Thiel Capital, in another state.\n\nMeanwhile, Google cofounder Larry Page has discussed leaving the state by year&#8217;s end, sources told the Times , while three limited liability companies associated with him have filed documents to incorporate in Florida.\nThe Thiel Foundation and Google parent Alphabet didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Thiel and Page did not respond to the Times .\nTech investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned on the risk of a wealth tax in California, saying it will eventually bankrupt the state.\n&#8220;The inevitable outcome will be an exodus of the state’s most talented entrepreneurs who can and will choose to build their companies in less regressive states,&#8221; he posted on X on Monday. &#8220;All that will be left behind is the middle class. The tax burden, then, will fall to the middle class because after the &#8216;richest&#8217; choose to leave, the middle class are both (a) the only ones left and (b) are the largest source of state income to extract taxes from.&#8221;\n\nOn Friday, he posted in a reply to Sen. Ted Cruz , who urged him to move to Texas, that it&#8217;s &#8220;under serious consideration.&#8221;\nBackers of the potential wealth tax must still gather enough signatures before it can qualify for the ballot in November 2026.\nThe proposal calls for California residents worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax equivalent to 5% of their assets. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Page is worth $270 billion and Thiel is worth $27.2 billion.\nThe healthcare union pushing the measure, the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, estimated the wealth tax could raise $100 billion in revenue and offset federal cuts.\nBut California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is also considered a top presidential hopeful, has come out against it.\n\nCompanies have already been leaving California for places with lower taxes and less red tape. Elon Musk moved Tesla and SpaceX to Texas.\nAnd while leading AI companies are based in California, new data centers and AI infrastructure are being built outside the state, where land, water and electricity are more available.\nNew Yorkers aired similar worries about an exodus after democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected the city&#8217;s mayor last month. But so far, that has yet to materialized as luxury home sales in Manhattan surged in November.\n\nStory Continues\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents part of Silicon Valley, said tax dollars helped build the AI industry and dismissed the idea that tech entrepreneurs wouldn&#8217;t start companies in the state due to a 1% tax, adding that innovators are drawn to the area&#8217;s talent.\n&#8220;We cannot have a nation with extreme concentration of wealth in a few places but where 70 percent of Americans believe the American dream is dead and healthcare, childcare, housing, education is unaffordable,&#8221; he said on X . &#8220;What will stifle American innovation, what will make us fall behind China, is if we see further political dysfunction and social unrest, if we fail to cultivate the talent in every American and in every city and town.&#8221;\nStill, he acknowledged lack of accountability and fraud concerns over state tax dollars, saying Sacramento needs anti-corruption measures.\nBlake Scholl, founder and CEO Boom Supersonic, pointed to the billions spent by California for a high-speed rail project that&#8217;s over-budget and behind schedule.\n&#8220;This is morally wrong and ends poorly for everyone,&#8221; he said about the wealth tax in response to Khanna on X.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list.

      "Content": "Here's Why Rivian Stock Is a Buy Before Jan. 1, 2026\n\nRyan Vanzo, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Rivian is a bona fide AI stock.\nSales could skyrocket next year thanks to new, cheaper models in its EV lineup.\n10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›\nShares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) languished for most of 2025. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 1, the company's stock price barely budged, although there were sporadic ups and downs along the way. Over the past month or so, however, shares have skyrocketed in value by more than 40%.\n\nI have been urging investors to take a closer look at Rivian stock all year. In many ways, the company appears to have the potential to become the next Tesla . Even after the latest price spike, shares still appear to be a long-term buy for several reasons, the most significant of which is expected to see serious progress in 2026.\nInvestors finally realize Rivian is an AI stock Take a quick look at Tesla's valuation and you'll realize that its stock is priced at a huge premium to nearly every other electric vehicle (EV) stock . It trades at a price-to-sales ratio of around 17. Rivian, meanwhile, trades at just 4.2 times sales.\nThere are many reasons for Tesla's premium. The company has a huge capital advantage, plus the best brand recognition in the industry. But it also has a leading position in robotaxis, a market that some experts believe will eventually be worth more than $5 trillion.\n\nThe robotaxi market looks like a high-tech business. But it's much more than that. Investors have been betting on autonomous-driving stocks for more than a decade.\nProgress has been slow. Cameras and detection devices cost a lot of money, and real-world testing has been limited due to safety and regulatory concerns. But artificial intelligence (AI) has vastly accelerated the timeline in recent years.\n\"There is a massive leap in AI happening right now, and it is resulting in smarter end-to-end AI systems that can learn much more efficiently, are interpretable, and can generalize to every possible scenario on the road,\" said Raquel Urtasun, the CEO of Waabi, a company that specializes in self-driving technology. \"These advances result in autonomous vehicles with superhuman capabilities that will enhance road safety and transform transportation as we know it.\"\n\nTesla has wisely invested heavily in AI, and investors have been keen to reward it for its efforts. In general, AI stocks have performed very well in 2025, so being lumped into that category has created direct gains for shareholders.\nFor most of the year, Rivian was not considered an AI stock. But I repeatedly pointed out how Rivian was also investing heavily into AI, just like Tesla. Rivian scheduled an AI day in early December, and shares seemingly started rising based on expectations.\n\nStory Continues\nExecutives largely delivered, with fresh updates on hands-free highway assist, point-to-point navigation, eyes-off alerts, and personal level 4 autonomy. Expect the EV maker's AI progress to continue to strengthen in 2026. But there's a catalyst I'm even more excited about over the near term.\nRivian will finally compete with Tesla next quarter Tesla has many vehicle models on the market. But its cheapest two models -- the Model Y and Model 3 -- account for more than 90% of its vehicle sales. To compete directly with Tesla, EV makers must have several impressive models priced under $50,000.\nThus far, few companies have achieved this feat. Most competing EVs are either too expensive or are priced cheaply with lackluster features and relatively minimal range.\n\nRivian currently has only two models on the road: the R1S and R1T. Both are priced above $70,000, significantly above what most consumers are willing to pay. But next quarter, production is expected to begin on the R2, its first model priced under $50,000. Two more models will follow: the R3 and R3X, both expected to be priced under $50,000.\nWithin a few months, Rivian could go from being a niche luxury automaker with AI upside to a legitimate Tesla competitor. More vehicles on the road give it more real-world data, further strengthening its AI.\nEven after the recent share price run-up, Rivian still has a market cap of less than $30 billion. Compare that to Tesla's $1.5 trillion valuation, and the long-term upside in Rivian stock becomes clear.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now? Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Elon Musk Predicts A New Economy: No Poverty, No Hunger And Work Is Optional\n\nErica Kollmann\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:01 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk has often shared a radical vision for the future of the global economy, suggesting that humanity is on the brink of a “post-scarcity” era characterized by the end of poverty and the elimination of labor.\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, he suggested that “applied intelligence” could trigger double-digit economic growth in the near term and triple-digit growth within five years.\n“Double-digit growth is coming within 12 to 18 months. If applied intelligence is proxy for economic growth, which it should be, triple-digit is possible in ~5 years,” he said on X.\nMusk basically predicted the end of the industrial age and the beginning of an “intelligence age” defined by abundance.\nDon't Miss:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\n“Applied Intelligence” Musk's theory is based on the idea that AI—specifically artificial general intelligence (AGI) and autonomous robotics—is the ultimate hack for productivity.\nIn standard economics, growth is limited by labor and capital. However, if AI can be scaled like software and embodied in hardware (like the Optimus robot), the cost of labor collapses toward the cost of electricity.\n\nNear-term (12-18 months): Double-digit growth (10%+) would be unprecedented for a developed economy like the U.S., which typically grows at 2-3%. This rate and timeframe suggests Musk expects immediate, massive efficiency gains from AI integration.\nLong-term (~5 years): Triple-digit growth (100%+) implies a doubling of the economy annually. This is mathematically transformative, suggesting a world where goods and services are produced so rapidly and cheaply that the GDP metric itself might become obsolete.\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nSkepticism Vs. Vision Critics argue that Musk's proposed timelines ignore realistic physical and regulatory hurdles.\nReal-world economic growth requires energy infrastructure, raw materials and global supply chains, none of which can scale at the speed of code.\nEven if intelligence is infinite, the lithium for batteries and the copper for power grids are not. Other inventions that transformed society, like steam or electricity, took decades to move the needle on national GDP.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, if Musk is even partially correct, the primary challenge for society will shift from “how do we create wealth?” to “how do we distribute it?” in an era where human labor is no longer the primary driver of value.\nRead Next:\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nHave $100k+ to invest?

      "Content": "Analysis-Waymo's San Francisco outage raises doubts over robotaxi readiness during crises\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPCG\n\nTSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A widespread power outage in San Francisco that led to Waymo robotaxis stalling and snarling traffic earlier this month has raised concerns about the readiness of autonomous vehicle operators to tackle major emergencies like earthquakes and floods.\nDriverless taxis from Alphabet unit ​Waymo, a ubiquitous feature on the city's streets, were stuck at intersections with their hazard lights turned on as traffic lights stopped working following a fire ‌at a PG&E substation that knocked out power to roughly one-third of the city on December 20, videos posted on social media showed. Waymo halted operations, resuming a day later.\n\nThe incident has renewed calls for ‌stricter regulation of the nascent but fast-growing industry as other companies including Tesla and Amazon's Zoox race to expand robotaxi services in several cities.\n\"If you get a response to a blackout wrong, regulators are derelict if they do not respond to that by requiring some sort of proof that the earthquake scenario will be handled properly,\" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Waymo said that while its robotaxis are designed to handle non-operational traffic signals as four-way stops, they occasionally request a ⁠confirmation check. Though the vehicles successfully traversed more than 7,000 ‌darkened signals on Saturday, \"the outage created a concentrated spike\" in confirmation requests that \"led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets,\" Waymo said.\n\nRobotaxi operators around the globe use remote access by humans - known in the industry as \"teleoperation\" - in varying degrees to monitor and control ‍vehicles. Waymo, for example, has a team of human \"fleet response\" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver, its bot, when it encounters a particular situation.\nBut such remote assistance has its limitations, and the Waymo outage highlights the need to regulate how robotaxi operators use the technology, said Missy Cummings, director of the George Mason University Autonomy and Robotics Center and former adviser to ​the U.S. road safety regulator.\n\"The whole point of having remote operations is for humans to be there when the system is not responsive in the way it should ‌be,\" she said. \"The federal government needs to regulate remote operations,\" Cummings said. \"They need to make sure that there's backup remote operations when there's some kind of catastrophic failure.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCalifornia's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulate and issue permits for the testing and commercial deployment of robotaxis, have said they are looking into the incident.\nThe DMV said it was talking to Waymo and other autonomous vehicle makers about actions related to emergency response. It also said it was formulating regulations to ensure remote drivers \"meet high standards for safety, accountability and responsiveness.\"\n\n'A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW'\nDeploying and commercializing fully autonomous vehicles have been harder than expected with high investments to ensure the technology is ⁠safe and public outcry after collisions forcing many to shut shop.\nFollowing a high-profile accident in 2023 ​when a robotaxi from General Motors' Cruise dragged a pedestrian, regulators revoked its permit, eventually leading the ​company to cease operations.\nBut robotaxis have returned to the spotlight with Tesla rolling out its service in Austin, Texas earlier this year and CEO Elon Musk promising rapid expansion. Waymo, which has grown slowly and steadily over the years since its launch as Google's self-driving project in ‍2009, has also accelerated expansion.\nWith a fleet of ⁠more than 2,500 vehicles, Waymo operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Metro Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe company said the confirmation processes its vehicles follow were established during early deployment and that it was now refining them to match its current scale. Waymo is implementing fleet-wide updates that provide vehicles with \"specific ⁠power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.\"\nBoth Cummings and Koopman said robotaxi operators should face additional permitting requirements once their fleets grow beyond a certain size to ensure that they have adequate ‌capabilities to deal with large-scale failures.\n\"If this had been an earthquake, it would have been a problem,\" Koopman said. \"This is just a shot across ‌the bow.\"\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Alistair Bell)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But with thin trading volume, investors won&rsquo;t really know if that rally will take shape until next week.\nEither way, investors continue to climb the wall of worry that includes tariffs, inflation, jobs, and the potential bubble in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Much of this is due to the relative strength of the consumer, which will continue to be something to watch in 2026.\n\nNext week will be another shortened trading week. Markets will be closed on Jan. 1. This is a time for many investors to step away, but the MarketBeat analysts will continue to stay on top of the stocks and stories moving the market. Here are some of our most popular stories from this week.\n&rarr; Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\nEarnings season is the time when many companies announce share buyback activity. This week, Thomas Hughes highlighted five companies that have some of the most aggressive share buyback programs and why those buybacks may drive stock price growth in 2026.\n&rarr; These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nHow do you know when a dividend stock is a keeper? This week, Hughes highlighted three companies that are raising their dividends within an environment where analyst sentiment continues to be bullish, suggesting capital growth to go along with that dividend growth.\n\nDarden Restaurants Inc. (NYSE: DRI) had a strong earnings report, but DRI stock has pulled back since the report. Hughes explained why investors should view this as a strong buying signal based on strong technical signals as well as bullish sentiment from analysts and institutions.\n&rarr; MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a volatile stock in 2025, but Sam Quirke explained why the stock continues to have a bullish upside. In his latest article, Quirke explained why a recent failed pullback is likely to be the catalyst for the TSLA share price to move above $500.\nQuirke was also examining the recent price action in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). The reminder to investors is that, in periods of consolidation, watch what analysts are signaling, which in this case suggests bullish upside for AMZN stock.\n\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nThe S&P 500 has continued to make new highs. However, investors may want to watch the Russell 2000, which has been outpacing the market and could signal a surge in small-cap stocks. This week, Chris Markoch made a case for five small-cap stocks that could benefit as investors rotate out of big tech.\n\nStory Continues\nPalantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) has rallied from a recent sell-off. Markoch gave investors three reasons Palantir will continue to be an essential stock in the AI infrastructure trade.\nIt&rsquo;s been a brutal year for beer stocks. However, a recent report from Goldman Sachs suggests that 2026 may be a time for beer to make a comeback. If that&rsquo;s true, Markoch analyzed two brewers that could give investors a buzz in 2026.\n\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nRyan Hasson also looked at small-cap stocks this week by pointing investors to MarketBeat&rsquo;s list of the highest-rated small-cap stocks. Hasson highlighted the top five names on the list and explained the case for future growth.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the best-performing technology stocks of 2025. So, is the recent pullback a healthy pause or the first sign of a correction? Hasson argued for the buy-the-dip story based on technical signals and institutional conviction.\nArticles by Leo Miller\nMarkets are expected to remain volatile in 2026. That's why buying stocks of dividend growers could be a smart strategy. This week, Leo Miller highlighted three companies that have aggressively raised their dividends and why each offers investors a reason to believe in capital growth that drives a higher total return.\n\nOn Dec. 22, three companies began trading as part of the S&P 500 Index. This stamp of approval generally gives stocks a short-term pop, but Miller explained why each company may give investors reasons for a solid growth story in 2026.\nSpace stocks have been strong performers in 2025, but three of these names have had strong insider selling in the last 30 days. Miller reminded investors that not all insider selling is equal, and that only one company may be sending a concerning signal.\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nQuantum computing stocks have given off a &ldquo;hurry up and wait&rdquo; vibe in 2025. That can frustrate traders, but it may give risk-tolerant investors an opportunity to accumulate shares on every pullback. This week, Nathan Reiff provided investors with several reasons to believe that D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) could be setting up investors for a strong 2026.\n\nPrecious metals have been one of the strongest trades in 2025, and that strength is spreading to mining stocks. This may be a case where bigger is better, and Reiff highlighted three large miners with attractive setups for 2026.\nThe oil sector has been on the opposite side of the commodities trade. However, Reiff noted that the weakness in oil may create an opportunity for contrarian, risk-tolerant investors. Read his article to understand why three energy stocks may be worth holding until oil reverses.\nArticles by Dan Schmidt\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are ending the year on a bearish note. That may have some investors thinking about buying the dip in some Bitcoin stocks. Dan Schmidt explained why that may be a mistake for two notable crypto-linked stocks that carry risks because of their cryptocurrency exposure.\n\nFor many investors, the end of the year is a time to set goals for the following year. For investors who are resolving to take more profits in 2026, Schmidt offers up three stocks that look ripe for profit-taking as 2025 comes to an end.\nArticles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\nThe &ldquo;AI bubble&rdquo; doom loop has been getting debunked this earnings season. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) was the latest company to deliver results that showed high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand extending well into the future. Jeffrey Neal Johnson wrote this week that Micron&rsquo;s results also point to a more balanced revenue mix and pricing power that will boost earnings.\nJohnson also pointed investors to a value disconnection with Vertical Aerospace (NYSE: EVTL). The company doesn&rsquo;t get as many headlines as competitors in the emerging eVTOL sector, but Johnson pointed out that the company achieved a significant milestone that could vault it into the lead in 2026.\n\nMany investors are hearing about sector rotation, which raises the question of what smart moves investors should make in 2026. Johnson put a spotlight on two ETFs that provide exposure to sectors likely to be part of a catch-up trade in 2026.\nArticles by Jordan Chussler\nIn many cases, investors are better off ignoring headline noise. Jordan Chussler explained why that appeared to be the case for Maplebear Inc. (NASDAQ: CART), better known as Instacart. The company is the target of investigations into its pricing practices and transparency. However, investors have shrugged off the news and are instead focused on the company&rsquo;s strong financials.\nOil stocks are down, but energy stocks tied to rising electricity prices had a strong year. This week, Chussler highlighted one exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows investors to capitalize on the historic and multi-year trend of higher electricity prices.\nThe article \" MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Travis Hoium, joined by Lou Whiteman and Rachel Warren. As a big topic this week is electric vehicles, and Ford is really the one that is the impetus for this conversation, even though you don't necessarily think about them as an EV company, but they are getting more or less getting out of the EV game, taking a $19.5 billion write off. Look, Lou, EVs were the future of the auto industry a few years ago. Every single company said that they were going to basically go 100% to EVs. You have Tesla, Rivian, Lucid , and others were thought to be disrupting Detroit. It's only been four years since a lot of those bets were made, and now we're really backing off. Tesla's sales are in decline. GM has pulled back. Now, Ford is doing the same. Were EVs over hyped, or what changed in the last few years, because this seems like a huge about-face?\n\nLou Whiteman: What changed? Four years and one administration, shall we say. But look, I am hesitant to say it was over hyped, but I do think we definitely got ahead of ourselves. I still believe EVs are the future. I believe that is where we're going. But I think the timeline was probably likely always going to be longer than we had hoped, and honestly, that we priced in. There was a new administration, and some of the incentives did change, which I think is part of what happened now. I don't want to put too much on the administrations. The subsidies, they were nice. But I think that if we're to take from this that the subsidies were the only reasons that these were selling, that the dependency is what makes EVs work, that's the wrong lesson. The subsidies were necessary, because the tech just isn't ready for prime time. It's not ready for anyone except the early adopters now.\n\nStory Continues\nTravis Hoium: Is it the tech or is it the cost? Because one of the things that I always go back and forth on is, people talk about range anxiety and infrastructure and things like that. I actually think those are pretty good for 99% of travel, and now we've got fast charging and things like that. But when I go look at an EV and go, could we replace our Volkswagen Atlas, a three-row SUV for a family of five with a dog? It just doesn't make any financial sense. Is it the technology, or is it the cost structure just isn't quite there yet, and really, the comparison in the industry is not to cars. It's to SUVs and trucks, and that's what people buy when they buy ice vehicles today.\n\nLou Whiteman: I think you're splitting hairs on cost versus tech, because I think part of the answer on cost is tech. Solid state, yes, will alleviate range anxiety. I think you're overly dismissive on that. I think whether or not it is practically a problem, I think if you could sit down and talk people through it, it's less of a problem than people think, but I do think it is the big bugaboo in people's heads why they dismiss it. But look, part of what solid state or whatever next generation batteries could do is mean that you can pack more storage energy density into them, fewer batteries, less cost. I think technology is the answer to the cost problem. It's pick your flavor, but I think it comes down to the fact that, the technology, as we have it today, is not sufficient for mass market sales in and of itself.\n\nTravis Hoium: Rachel, when you look at these companies stepping back from electric vehicles, what are you thinking about, because these big trends, we're talking about trillions of dollars in value that is up for grabs for investors, either on the plus side or the downside.\nRachel Warren: I do think it is a combination of tech and costs. There's regulatory elements here, too. We want to think about this from a holistic perspective. We know that EVs generally remain more expensive than comparable internal combustion engine vehicles, and I think at a time, as well, with high interest rates, affordability, it's a major barrier for the mass market. That's on top of the existing challenges we've seen. I do think range anxiety is a real thing. There is a real lack of confidence in the current public charging networks' reliability and availability. But I think it's really important to note. These automakers are not giving up on EVs entirely. They're really recalibrating their strategies, and I think that's to align with current market realities and consumer demand. It doesn't spell the end of EVs, but I do think that there is a certain extent to which we have to recalibrate our expectations for where this industry is going to grow in the next 5-10 years. We look at Ford. You mentioned that nearly $20 billion write-down. That's a massive charge to cancel several pure EV models. The fully electric version of the F-150 is being fully discontinued. They're going to be working on the F-150 Lightning extended-range electric vehicle. It uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery.\n\nTravis Hoium: That's really the trend is toward hybrids instead of pure EV.\nRachel Warren: Absolutely, and a lot of that, again, is really focusing on that lower-cost universal EV platform. Ford now expects their EV division is going to reach profitability by 2029. That is a three-year delay from their previous 2026 target. But I think that this is a trend that we're seeing across the industry. Don't discount the impact of regulatory elements, either. Major one was the $7,500 federal consumer tax credit that expired on September 30th. I think that is having an impact. It's really a perfect storm in some ways, but I also think that this means that we're just seeing shifts in where the EV industry is going, how it's evolving. It's not following maybe the trajectory that some analysts thought. But I do think that there is significant opportunity in this space for investors and for these auto makers, both traditional and otherwise, over the next decade.\n\nTravis Hoium: There's a lot of changes going on in electric vehicles, but what is Detroit maybe getting right? We'll talk about that when we come back. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nOne of the great things about Apple products is that it's really easy for us to handle the security, the updates, the pre-installed applications. We've been able to do that without a dedicated IT support team.\nWelcome back to Motley Fool Money. Detroit has gone from being all in on EVs to backing off. I want to focus on Detroit here first. We'll get to the full electric vehicle companies like Tesla and Lucid in just a second. But GM was really the first one to step back. They didn't make a big announcement like this, Lou, but they did pull back on their ambitions for electric vehicles. They've built their lines to be a little bit more flexible so you can build EV, or you can build a nice vehicle, or hybrid, anything in between. Ford has essentially said that his future is hybrid, at least for now. Is this a short-term strategy for these companies, or is this long-term the right thing for them to do?\n\nLou Whiteman: I think it's both. The nice thing about these companies is they have the scale. They have the balance sheets and the resources to do both, to have their cake and eat it too. I think it's right for right now, but it's also the right long-term strategy. Look, at the end of the day, they are trying to sell vehicles for a profit. Whether or not the power train doesn't matter. Ford is investing in hybrids because right now the hybrids is what they can do with a profit. We talked before about the Tech. The battery technology works a lot better in conjunction with a gas burning or a nice engine, or at least some lawn mower engine to keep it going. As the tech improves, as EVs improve, as batteries improve, it's only a half step to get there. They're not abandoning that. Look, I don't see this as giving up on EVs. I think this is recognizing the reality that we got ahead of ourselves, and what we can sell for a profit today is what we're going to focus on. Look, a lot of that effort, a lot of just the integrating batteries and battery power trains into automobiles, which they have to do with the EVs, that is at least halfway there to when EVs are ready. I think they'll be just fine long-term.\n\nTravis Hoium: Rachel, the other piece of this is that Detroit companies are making money. Ford, General Motors, they are profitable. Is this the right thing to say? You know what? That's the profitable piece of the business. We have competitors like Rivian, but they're losing money. Tesla, their margins are in decline. Volumes are in decline. We just heard that they have a four-month low in sales in the month of November. Maybe this is the right thing. If you were allocating capital today, maybe you would be putting that money into ICE vehicles or at least hybrids and not into EVs. Is that the right thing for Detroit?\nRachel Warren: I think so, at least for now, but I also want to note, Detroit is certainly looking at the future of EVs as different than maybe we thought a few years ago, but they're not giving up on EVs entirely. I think they're really more recognizing the current limitations of the existing market and putting those financial powerhouses and that manufacturing infrastructure to work rather than just scrapping that altogether. You have to think about that. The market for the initial wave of electric vehicles was made up of early adopters. The next phase really requires these companies to win over the more cost-conscious, the more skeptical consumers. But many current models they're very high-end, they're expensive. I think the current situation we're seeing indicates that the transition to EVs, it's more of a marathon in certain times than a sprint. Sales volumes are still growing globally. I will note this, particularly in China, but the rate of growth has slowed significantly compared to what many analysts were projecting a few years ago. I think the reality remains that there's a large segment of consumers that are hesitant. About pure EVs hybrids are more profitable for automakers than many fully electric models. They require less drastic changes to existing manufacturing processes and supply chains. We've heard from Ford's CEO Jim Farley in the past that hybrids shouldn't be viewed as just transitional technology, that they're a permanent part of a future lineup. I think that's the case, that contrasts a little bit from GM CEO Mary Barra. She said that hybrids are more of an interim solution. But I do think hybrids deserve really significant investment focus for at least the next several years until those next generation EVs become more affordable. I think that's a reality we're going to keep seeing from automakers, at least for the near term.\n\nTravis Hoium: I want to get a feeling on whether both of you are bullish or bearish on the future of Detroit. Lou, I'm going to have you go first.\nLou Whiteman: I'm bullish on the future, but don't take that as investment advice, because I don't want to own these companies.\nTravis Hoium: Even at a 5, 6, 7 PE ratio, they're just that attractive enough.\nLou Whiteman: But go back and find when they did much better than that. I think that there are natural limits to this business. There is not a more complex supply chain in all of industry. Back at forward, back in the day, $10 billion was zero. That way, if they got below $10 billion in cash on the balance [OVERLAPPING] sheet, and that speaks to the cash flow. The way money flows between suppliers to suppliers. This is just such a complex business, such a tough business. I think they are survivors, but over time, you have not in the long run beaten the market with these companies, and I don't see that changing, no matter what they're valued today. I think they are valued-based on the complexity of business, and I think there are easier ways to make money than investing in automakers.\n\nTravis Hoium: Rachel, are you bullish or bearish?\nRachel Warren: I would say I'm bullish, but I do tend to agree with Lou. The economics of these businesses don't particularly compel me as a long-term investor, and I do think that speaks to a lot of the mechanisms and complexities of how these businesses run. But I do think that there is a role for these companies to play in the long-term in the EV space. Overall, they are financially sound businesses, so that's something to know.\nLou Whiteman: What I think, Charles to note is whether or not we're right or wrong, we are speaking conventional wisdom, and you can be right by yourself, but if the market hates automakers, and so I think part of it is that even if your take is right and they are good values here, I don't trust that a critical mass in the market will agree with you and bid up the shares to make it worth the bet.\n\nRachel Warren: I think it's a great point.\nTravis Hoium: It'll be interesting to see over the past year, GM stock, this one that I follow more closely, up 58%, Tesla is only up 2%. Even over the past five years, Tesla's beating GM but only 124% to 92%. Depending on your time frame and how these companies do, eventually, making money seems like it matters. Lou is right that typically, the market does not like automakers, but they do still love EV makers. We're going to get to that next. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nWelcome back to Motley Fool Money. As much as EVs may be in decline right now, EVs' stocks certainly aren't, Tesla is one of the most valuable companies in the world. A $1.6 trillion valuation is recording. Rivian has been on a tear recently. They're worth over $20 billion. Is this segment of the market, can it live up to the hype in these valuations, Rachel? Or does Detroit actually have this right in that EV's maybe aren't the future right now, and we should be focusing elsewhere?\n\nRachel Warren: I think we need to be really careful with some of the hype that's surrounding a lot of these businesses. We do know that EVs look to be a part of the future. I think that's very much the case. But it's interesting to compare these models. I think a lot of people assume that traditional automakers would have a built-in advantage over these newer entrance to the EV space. That hasn't necessarily been the case. Traditional automakers have faced their own challenges, even though they are more financially bolstered, and we've seen a lot of these newer entrants, like the Rivians of the world, that are burning through cash. They're not profitable. They're struggling in their own way, but the market seems excited about them. I think we as investors need to take a really measured approach to understand where the opportunity lies. I think investors are betting on a lot of advancements in things like battery technology, software that could provide some very high-margin revenue streams for these businesses in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, as we've talked about, legacy automakers they're really focusing heavily on hybrids, and I think that one of the things when we take an example of these companies, you look at Tesla as a sustainably profitable business that essentially created the EV market. Tesla is often valued not just as a car company but as a tech and energy company. You look at Rivian, which has been on quite a tear up over the last year. They're still in the growth phase. They're not yet consistently profitable. They're operating at a net loss. I think you look at these valuations, it really represents a belief in the market of a substantial long-term shift in the global auto industry. Will that come to fruition? I think that remains to be seen.\n\nLou Whiteman: I think it's really important. Rachel, I think it's really important, though, to separate out Tesla from the rest of these companies because I do think it's different. Travis, as you said, Tesla sales are down, but they are also gaining market share in the US. [OVERLAPPING]\nTravis Hoium: That's because the EV space overall is shrinking.\nLou Whiteman: Exactly.\nTravis Hoium: Tesla is taking a bigger piece of a small.\nLou Whiteman: Elon said we think that actually the subsidy is going away. I might help us relative to competition. The reason for that is Tesla's just further along on the growth curve. They have cash in the bank. They have established sales channels, all of that. I do think Tesla is relatively fine. Look, and as far as the stock, this is a stock that Rachel says never traded on current day automotive, and you cannot begin to justify it based on current day automotive. It's always been about what is to come. It doesn't surprise me the stock is held up. I still think that there is a compelling bullcase that is a long-term case that isn't tied to current-day EV sales. As for the Rivians and the rest of the world, I am surprised the stocks have held up. We talked about before with some of the more diversified automakers, the power of a balance sheet, or the need for a balance sheet in this industry. This is a really cutthroat industry. They are younger than Tesla and not as established. They don't have the diverse product line, I think they need. I think this could be a problematic year for young companies that are still cash-starved. I might be selling Rivian short. Cost of good sales is going the right direction. Other metrics are going in the right direction. Maybe the market is right, and that they have gotten over the hump, and they can get through this time. I think that's possible. I just don't think it's a given, and I'm surprised at how excited the investors remain about this, given what I think are risks.\n\nTravis Hoium: You brought up scale earlier with the Detroit Automakers. That's one thing that Rivian has really struggled with. Their normal Illinois facility has never run at full capacity. They're upgrading some of their lines to be able to make the R2 there. There's going to be I think it's 215,000 units of capacity. Even when that's completed, that'll be in 2026. It's really hard to run the numbers to them to get to profitability with 215,000 units of capacity. They have to build a new facility in Georgia down the road from you. That's going to add 400,000 units. They don't have the cash to do that. That cash is debt that is supposed to be coming from the US government. This seems like a lot of things need to go right for these companies that, like you said, are not named Tesla because it's not just Rivian, Lucid's in the same boat. Basically, every other and a whole bunch of other companies have already fallen by the wayside. It seems like scale matters in this business. Detroit has it, and they're choosing to go away from EVs.\n\nLou Whiteman: I think that's all fair. I will say the one thing, and maybe this is wish casting. But there's a lot of some costs. You mentioned Georgia. There's a lot of investment from Georgia. These are long-term projects. We could have elections before things really come to shove and I think in our case with Rivian, the state of Georgia is invested, so there might be more levers than a skeptic who might want to short the stock would think, which is why I wouldn't short it either. But yes, I think if nothing else, I'm surprised it's not trading based on at least some of the potential headwinds or potential risk out there because they do look significant to me.\nTravis Hoium: Well, Detroit is definitely placing their bets, but investors still think EVs are the future, so we'll see how this one plays out. Obviously, something to watch because this is a big jobs driver. Is a huge expense for people. Depending on what happens with consumers, 2026 is going to be a big year.

      "Content": "Tesla (TSLA) Declines More Than Market: Some Information for Investors\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nIn the latest trading session, Tesla (TSLA) closed at $475.19, marking a -2.1% move from the previous day. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.03%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.04%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.09%.\nThe electric car maker's shares have seen an increase of 13.79% over the last month, surpassing the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 12.09% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.57%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Tesla in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, Tesla is projected to report earnings of $0.46 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 36.99%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $24.76 billion, down 3.7% from the prior-year quarter.\nTSLA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $1.63 per share and revenue of $94.76 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -32.64% and -3%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Tesla. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.02% lower. At present, Tesla boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn the context of valuation, Tesla is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 297.94. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 16.69, which means Tesla is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nWe can also see that TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 8.51. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Automotive - Domestic industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.97.\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 76, finds itself in the top 31% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "From Tesla To Nike: Why Tim Cook's Buy Is Drawing Market Parallels\n\nSurbhi Jain\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNKE\n\nAAPL\n\nMarket bottoms rarely arrive with reassurance. They show up when skepticism turns casual — when stocks stop being debated and start being dismissed. That's the backdrop against which Apple Inc ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook 's purchase of Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) shares is suddenly getting serious attention .\n\nEarlier this year, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) found its footing just as public commentary around the stock turned openly mocking, including a high-profile jab from Tim Walz . The remark didn't cause the bottom — but it coincided with a moment when pessimism appeared fully priced in. Tesla didn't explode higher overnight. It simply stopped going down. And that was the tell.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nPeak Skepticism Setup Nike now sits in a similarly uncomfortable place. The stock has spent months under pressure from margin concerns, inventory cleanups, and questions around consumer demand. Expectations are low. Sentiment is thin. The narrative has grown tired. The shares are down over 18% YTD.\nThat's what makes Tim Cook's personal purchase of roughly $3 million worth of Nike shares stand out. Not the size — the timing.\n\nWhy This Buy Matters Cook isn't a Nike insider. He isn't required to buy. And he isn't known for tactical trades. When someone with his profile steps into a struggling consumer name, markets naturally ask whether downside risk is becoming asymmetric.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThis isn't a call that Nike's problems are solved. Execution still matters, and fundamentals will ultimately decide the outcome. But selective, high-profile buying tends to show up closer to inflection points than to peaks.\nTesla's Quiet Lesson Tesla's bottom earlier this year offered a simple reminder: markets often turn when confidence looks misplaced and skepticism sounds effortless. Nike may not follow the same script — but Tim Cook's move suggests the risk-reward conversation has shifted.\nAnd when that happens, the story usually changes before the stock does.\nRead Next:\nBuffett's Secret to Wealth?

Accountability is vital for every investor, myself included.\nLooking at the unusual options activity from Nov. 26, I noticed that Tesla (TSLA), Robinhood Markets (HOOD), and FedEx (FDX) had put options expiring in 30 days on Dec. 26 that generated significant income for those who sold them short.\nAs a result, I’ve decided to look ahead 30 days to see whether these same three stocks can deliver a repeat performance. Here’s what I found.\nHave an excellent weekend!\nThe TSLA, HOOD, and FDX Put Options From Nov. 26 First up is the Tesla Dec. 26 $390 put with a bid price of $8.15. The Vol/OI (volume-to-open interest) ratio was 1.39, above the 1.24 cutoff. Tesla’s closing price on Nov. 26 was $426.58. As of Dec. 23, it was up 13.8% over the previous 18 trading days.\nWith a short day on the 24th, closed on Christmas Day, and a full day on the 26th, the $8.15 in premium income from selling the put would generate an annualized return of 25.55% [$8.15 bid price / $390 strike price - $8.15 bid price * 365 / 30 days]. The income is secure, and the shares are unlikely to be subject to assignment.\nSuccess.\nNext up is Robinhood Markets. In this case, there were two to choose from. The $115 put was 11.5% OTM (out of the money), whereas the $120 was OTM by 6.8%. When selling puts, I look for strikes 10% or more OTM to provide a margin of safety.\nWith the share price closing at $120.24 on Dec. 23, the margin of safety on the $115 strike would be helpful. However, the share price is down nearly 22% since hitting an all-time high of $153.86 in early October, so it’s unlikely to be deep ITM (in the money) at the Dec. 26 expiration.\nWorst-case scenario on the $120 strike: you’re assigned the shares, buying them at $114.85 [$120 strike price - $5.15 bid price], a much better entry point than two-and-a-half months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the $115 strike, your annualized return of 40.3% [$3.65 bid price / $115 strike price - $3.65 bid price * 365 / 30 days] is very healthy. Not as plentiful as the 54.9% annualized return for the $120 strike [$5.15 bid price / $120 strike price - $5.15 bid price * 365 / 30 days], but reasonable nonetheless.\nLastly, we have the FedEx $270 put with a bid price of $9.10. The Vol/OI ratio was 1.33. FedEx’s closing price on Nov. 26 was $275.83. As of Dec. 23, it was up 7.0% over the previous 18 trading days. It’s unlikely that its share price will drop below $270 before Friday’s close. The put’s annualized return is 42.6% [$9.10 bid price / $270 strike price - $9.10 bid price * 365 / 30 days].\n\nBased on $2,240 in premium income (using $120 strike) and $78,000 in cash held for the secured puts, the average annualized return is 35.4%.\nI like it.\nCan We Beat 35%? I don’t see why not. I’m being facetious. It’s not easy to consistently generate 35% annualized returns from selling puts--but we’ll try just the same.\nTesla should be the easiest to deliver a good return because of its massive options volume—its 30-day average is 2.28 million, compared to 277,050 for HOOD and 14,910 for FDX. I guess we’ll see.\n\nThe $390 strike from the previous section has a bid price, as I write this, of $1.86 based on a 31-day DTE (days to expiration). That’s an annualized return of 5.6%, considerably less than the 25.55% return from the 30 days between Nov. 26 and Dec. 23. We’ll have to move closer to the money.\nThe Jan. 23/2026 $455 put has an annualized return of 29.3%. That’s great, but the Vol/OI ratio is just 0.14, well below the 1.24 cutoff.\nDue to limited choice, I'll have to use a different DTE. The Jan. 9/2026 $457.50 put expires in 17 days from Dec. 23 with a bid price of $6.25, an annualized return of 29.7%, and a Vol/OI ratio of 9.45.\nOTM by 5.46%, the profit probability remains high, at 78.19%. I may have to use Jan. 9/2026 puts for HOOD and FDX.\nIt won't be easy to find a put OTM that will generate a nearly 55% annualized return like the Dec. 26 $120 put. The best I can do—keeping in mind I’m looking for unusual options activity—is the Jan. 7/2026 $107 put.\nIt has a bid price of $1.04, an annualized return of 21.1%, and a 3.43 Vol/OI ratio. More importantly, an 86.05% probability of profit means there’s a good chance the share price will be above the $105.96 breakeven in 17 days.\nLastly, and the toughest of the three, is FedEx. I don’t see any of the put strike prices for Jan. 9/2026 having Vol/OI ratios above 1.24. The remaining January expiration dates also show low volume.\n\nFedEx is out for income generation in January.\nThe Bottom Line Result Reducing the DTE to 17 days from 30 has enabled me to find reasonable annualized returns of 29.7% and 21.1% for Tesla and Robinhood, respectively.\nBased on $729 in premium income and $56,450 in cash held for the secured puts, the average annualized return would be 27.7%, 770 basis points lower than the returns generated by the three stocks over the past 30 days.\nWhile disappointing, given FedEx’s low options volume, the outcome was somewhat predictable.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Tesla’s (TSLA) stock four years ago, it would be worth about $13,700 today, thanks to a 37% price gain since late December 2021.\nThat’s a solid profit, but it falls well short of the massive returns you’d have gotten with other high-profile stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) or Alphabet (GOOG). The next four years could be a lot more lucrative for Tesla investors — or a lot worse.\n\nWhat could a $10,000 Tesla investment today look like by 2030? Here’s what a couple of experts had to say.\nAlso see the Tesla investing mistake that could cost you thousands .\nThe Bull Case A $10,000 investment in Tesla today could be worth twice that much by 2030 if the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle (EV) maker reaches certain benchmarks, according to Chad Cummings, an attorney and certified public accountant (CPA) at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax.\n\nBut for that to happen, a lot of things would have to go the right way.\n“If Tesla scales its energy storage segment and increases paid software penetration above current rates, [its] position could exceed $20,000,” Cummings told GOBankingRates. “The S&P 500 at an 8% compound rate places the same $10,000 near $15,900, which is the realistic hurdle Tesla must beat. Even so, there are some major headwinds.”\nThose headwinds include “litigation and regulatory exposure” that could drive Tesla’s downside more than macro trends, according to Cummings.\n“A single autonomous-related fatality that triggers a regulatory halt can cut Tesla’s valuation by tens of billions within days,” he said. “The insurance and legal systems still have yet to fully price in autonomous driving and the results, which creates something of a hot potato.”\n\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nLooking Beyond the EV Market Another thing to keep an eye on is how Tesla’s non-EV businesses perform over the next few years — mainly its energy generation/storage and other services. These businesses are considered by many to be the stock’s main growth drivers.\n“A $10,000 investment in Tesla right now depends less on the EV side than people think,” said Edward Corona, founder of The Options Oracle AI Trade Manager . “I honestly don’t believe Tesla’s main focus is cars anymore — but they still need the car business to keep the money flowing while they build everything else. And Elon has about one trillion reasons now to make sure the long-term plan pays off.”\nThe “one trillion reasons” comment refers to Musk’s new compensation package , which could be worth about $1 trillion if certain milestones are met.\n\nStory Continues\nBy 2030, a $10,000 investment will “come down to whether Tesla can use the EV side to fund the bigger vision without letting margins fall apart,” Corona told GOBankingRates. “If they balance that right, the stock could look a lot different in a few years. If they don’t, investors will feel it. Tesla’s future isn’t about selling cars — it’s about whether the rest of the plan actually gets executed.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s shares are up by 28% year-to-date and by 39% since September 10th. December has seen several analysts focus on the firm. On the 19th, Deutsche Bank raised Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s share price target to $500 from $470 and reiterated a Buy rating. The bank pointed out that while it expects weak delivery figures for the fourth quarter, the overall narrative for robotaxi was robust. On the same day, Truist also raised its share price target for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). It set the new price target at $444, up from an earlier $406, and kept a Hold rating. Like Deutsche, Truist pointed out that the firm’s autonomy initiatives and the robotaxi will play a key role in its valuation. However, an interesting share by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) on November 13th outlined the firm’s plans to use its Megapack batteries to power data centers. The release provided exposure to the firm when it came to the AI data center buildout in the US. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) outlined that AI model training runs that used GPUs could fluctuate by as much as 90% and the Megapacks would help with it. The announcement hasn’t gone unnoticed by Jim Cramer’s radar either, as the CNBC TV host commented:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Electrek was the first to report on the move, which seems to be an effort to cut down on Tesla's expanding stock of Cybertrucks since sales have been underwhelming.Tesla could make between $80 million and $160 million in internal sales from the trucks, which cost $80,000 apiece. Even while there was a lot of enthusiasm at first and more than a million preorders in 2019, just around 60,000 of those reservations have turned into real sales.Some people say that the deal between companies shows how hard it is for Tesla to satisfy expectations for the Cybertruck, which has gotten a lot of criticism for its price, range, and design revisions since it came out. Some people also wondered whether it was right for SpaceX, which gets government contracts, to acquire cars that weren't marketed by another Musk-owned firm.\nWarning!

      "Content": "'Good Lord' — Dave Ramsey Reacts To 59-Year-Old Working Two Jobs With $258K In Loans, Then Tells Her To Hit $120K And 'Leave The Cave, Kill Something'\n\nCasey B. Renner\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:46 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nA caller from Roanoke, Virginia, told \"The Ramsey Show\" that she is working two jobs while carrying $258,000 in student loan debt at age 59. LaRhonda said her primary job pays about $60,000 a year and that she also has a mortgage. She asked whether there was any way to make the student loan balance \"go away.\"\n\n\"Good Lord,\" personal finance expert Dave Ramsey said after confirming her age.\nThree Degrees And A Growing Balance LaRhonda told the hosts about her educational background. She said she holds three degrees: a bachelor's degree in multidisciplinary studies focused on criminal justice and religion, a master's degree in accounting, and a master's degree in divinity with a focus on theology and homiletics.\n\nDon't Miss:\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nShe said that much of the debt came from the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students, which she took out to pay for her son's college education.\nA Career That Took A Different Turn With that context, Ramsey asked why someone with a master's degree in accounting was earning about $60,000 a year. LaRhonda said accounting jobs she explored in her area paid less than her current position.\nWhen co-host George Kamel asked whether she was working in accounting, LaRhonda said she was not. She said she works in logistics as a logistics specialist at Volvo Trucks.\n\nKamel questioned how her degrees were being used and said her current role was in logistics rather than accounting or divinity. Ramsey added that accounting skills can apply in logistics but said her multidisciplinary criminal justice degree was not part of her work.\nReferring to her age and loan balance, Ramsey said the numbers were \"disturbing\" and told her she had \"not monetized your knowledge base very well.\"\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nThe Income Gap Comes Into Focus The discussion then shifted to income. Ramsey said the debt itself was not the main issue and that the figures do not work at her current income level. He said many people with a master's degree in accounting earn six figures, often starting between $100,000 and $125,000, and said moving into higher-paying roles would be required.\n\"I'd like you to be at 120 heading towards 220,\" Ramsey said. He added that Roanoke is \"not a backward town\" and said the area could support higher-paying roles. He also said supply chain positions generally pay more than $60,000.\n\nStory Continues\nLaRhonda said employers she spoke with expected experience using accounting software such as SAP, a widely used accounting and enterprise software system. She said her coursework emphasized manual accounting methods rather than software-based systems.\nRamsey responded that accounting has been computer-driven for decades and said learning those systems would be necessary. He told her that at this stage of her career, increasing income is the only way the math works and said she must push hard into higher-earning opportunities, a shift he described as the point where someone must \"leave the cave, kill something\" to change their financial trajectory.\n\nRead Next:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "Waymo Expands Robotaxi Footprint as 2026 Becomes a Crucial Test\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBloomberg reporting suggests Waymo's accelerating expansion could mark an important phase in testing whether autonomous ride-hailing can develop into a viable, potentially profitable business at scale. After operating robotaxis in cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, Waymo has said it is targeting more than 1 million rides per week by the end of next year, a level it has already reached on a monthly basis since the spring. Bloomberg News has also reported that Waymo is in talks to raise funds at a valuation near $100 billion, which would roughly double its valuation from a year earlier, alongside an annual revenue run rate above $350 million. As of recent public disclosures, Waymo is permitted to or testing its technology in 26 of the top 30 US metro areas and plans to launch in 12 additional cities in 2026, including London, with early deployments expected to remain limited in size.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe expansion reflects a partnership-led approach that could help manage costs and operational complexity as the business scales. Waymo expanded into Austin and Atlanta in 2025 with Uber ( NYSE:UBER ), bringing its commercial presence to five cities, and has worked with Uber-backed fleet managers on tasks such as cleaning, charging, and maintenance. Future launches are expected to introduce additional partners, including Lyft in Nashville and Avis Budget Group in Dallas. Gaining exposure to multiple geographies, regulatory regimes, and operating models could give Waymo useful insights as it competes with rivals such as Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Amazon's Zoox, which have also introduced robotaxi services at a smaller scale. Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai has said internally that the business is not expected to be financially meaningful to the parent company until 202728.\n\nAs Waymo has scaled, Bloomberg reporting indicates the company has encountered operational and technical challenges that highlight remaining uncertainties. These have included so-called edge cases such as interactions with stopped school buses, police activity, and incorrect turns, as well as a temporary suspension of service during a major San Francisco power outage when vehicles became immobilized. Waymo has said its data show significantly fewer pedestrian injury crashes than human drivers and that safety remains central to its strategy. Other developers are also preparing customer-facing launches in 2026, with Lucid and Nuro planning to offer self-driving vehicles for Uber riders in San Francisco and additional global markets. With multiple deployments expected next year, 2026 could provide clearer signals on whether robotaxi technology can translate into sustainable earnings over time.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "From pandemic to AI boom: The new reality of global supply chains\n\nRob Lenihan\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:19 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nElon Musk probably said it best when the Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO declared, “the supply chain stuff is really tricky.”\nOh, you’d better believe it.\nThe supply chain—the network of people, organizations, and information that moves a product or service from its origin to the final customer—is crucial to the world’s economy, as it ensures efficiency and lowers costs.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed just how fragile global supply chains are.\n“For decades, we have grown accustomed to ever quicker deliveries with increasing methods of tracking,” said David Dreyfus, Rutgers Business School supply chain management professor. “Two-day deliveries, free returns, and omni-channel retailing have become the norm.”\nSo, he asked, what happened during this pandemic that caused our supply chains to play out of tune?\n“You may remember that we ran short of ventilators, personal protection equipment, toilet paper, and computer chips,” Dreyfus wrote in a chapter of Reflections on the Pandemic: Covid and Social Crises in the Year Everything Changed .\n“Instead of an isolated disruption, as is usually the case amid a natural disaster or war, this pandemic occurred almost simultaneously around the world.”\n\nDreyfus said the pandemic revealed the level of globalization and complexity of our modern supply chains—as well as the fragility.\n“When any part of this chain breaks, disruptions are likely to follow,” he said. “War and inflation offer new disruptions. Better and more robust supply chain management principles should be adopted.”\nAI boom pressures supply chain “Ultimately, our quest to manage the risk within businesses continues,” Dreyfus said.\nThe world’s economy has largely recovered from the pandemic, but supply chain concerns still linger.\nMore on the tech industry:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nThe semiconductor industry's revenue is projected to hit record highs in 2025, with the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) calling for global chip sales to hit $700.9 billion.\nThis is one giant step toward the industry’s goal of $1 trillion in annual chip sales by 2030, and it is being driven primarily by booming demand for AI chips, data centers, automotive electronics, and consumer electronics.\nHowever, industry executives are concerned about supply chain stability, energy security, and talent shortages, according to the 21st annual Global Semiconductor Outlook by KPMG LLP and the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA).\n\nStory Continues\nFueled by the AI boom, 93% of industry leaders expect revenue growth in 2026, but the bullish outlook is tempered by significant operational and geopolitical risks.\nFor the first time, KPMG stated that leaders now rank tariffs and trade policy as their top concern, and some fear they may not be able to procure sufficient energy to power their advanced chip manufacturing facilities.\n\n“We're seeing a fundamental surge in semiconductor demand that spans the entire economy—from AI and data centers to electric vehicles,” Chad Seiler, Line of Business Leader, Technology, Media and Telecom at KPMG US, said in a statement.\n“This broad-based demand creates a more resilient growth trajectory, but it also creates intense pressure.”\nThe survey is based upon the opinions of 151 executives, over half of whom are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.\n“Leaders are now faced with the challenge of capitalizing on this historic opportunity while simultaneously navigating supply chain, energy and talent challenges,” Seiler added.\nPresident Donald Trump’s tariff regimen also seriously rattled the world’s supply chains.\nThe chip sector had to contend with increased costs and supply chain reconfigurations, which created uncertainty and led to higher prices for tech products as companies tried to avoid tariffs by investing in new locations or redesigning products to use local components.\n\nAI can aid supply chain planning While fabless and IP companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) are thriving, Infosys said that integrated device manufacturers and equipment suppliers may face contraction due to supply chain disruptions and cost pressures.\nGeopolitical tensions are disrupting global supply chains, introducing trade barriers, export controls, and shifting production priorities, which in turn create uncertain and rising costs, according to the digital consulting and services firm.\n\nRelated: RTO mandates to AI agents: How work is changing in 2026 and beyond\n“Upstream challenges, such as shortages of neon gas and rare earth metals, are worsened by geopolitical risks—from the war in Ukraine to China’s export restrictions,” Infosys said.\n“Additionally, delays in new fab construction, such as TSMC's Arizona facility that is now rescheduled for 2028, have intensified supply concerns.”\nThe firm said companies with a robust talent pipeline and resilient supply chains “will be best positioned to navigate these complexities and drive long-term success through 2030.”\n“Companies are diversifying supply chains, forming strategic partnerships, and leveraging AI-driven forecasting,” Infosys said.\n“At the same time, the focus on domestic semiconductor production is increasing. While this shift offers opportunities for resilience and innovation, it also introduces risks of fragmentation and geopolitical tensions.”\n\nAI can be used across the entire supply chain, according to Haslam College of Businesses’ Global Supply Chain Institute .\n“Transportation and logistics companies use AI technology and predictive analytics to help with route planning to enhance productivity and decrease costs,” the institute said on its website.\n“By analyzing factors like traffic, weather, and transportation networks, AI helps companies find the fastest routes, saving time and money. AI can also maximize cargo space to ensure trucks are loaded as efficiently as possible to save on fuel.”\nRelated: AI growth strains electrical grid as tech companies expand operations\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 26, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

      "Content": "Tesla Under Scrutiny Due to Model 3 Door Release Concerns\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKAR\n\nOPLN\n\nGM\n\nTesla, Inc. TSLA is under scrutiny after the U.S. auto safety regulator launched a defect investigation into Model 3 compact sedans, citing concerns that emergency door release controls may be difficult to access or identify in critical situations.\n\nPer the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the probe covers about 179,071 model year 2022 vehicles. It was initiated on Dec. 23 following a defect petition alleging that the mechanical door release is concealed, unlabeled and not intuitive to locate during emergencies.\n\nThe automaker primarily uses electronic door latches that operate via buttons instead of conventional mechanical handles. Although the vehicles are equipped with manual door releases for emergencies or power outages, safety experts have long warned that these releases are not consistently visible, clearly labeled or easy to find, especially for rear-seat passengers.\n\nOpening a defect investigation does not automatically result in a recall, but it represents the first stage of a regulatory review that could lead to further action if a safety-related defect is identified.\n\nThis marks the second probe this year into Tesla&rsquo;s door handles. In September, the NHTSA opened an investigation into the 2021 Model Y SUV, affecting roughly 174,000 vehicles, after reports that parents were unable to open the electric doors to reach their children following drives. In four cases, parents reportedly broke the vehicle&rsquo;s windows to rescue their children.\n\nTesla&rsquo;s Zacks Rank & Key Picks TSLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the auto space are General Motors Company GM, OPENLANE, Inc.

Investors still believe Tesla’s future is as something more than a car company. In fact, much of the five-year increase happened in the second half of 2025.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock recently reached an all-time high and has outperformed the broader market over the past five years.\nInvestor optimism centers on Tesla becoming a leader in self-driving taxis and robotics.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThere is only one explanation for the success of the shares. People and institutions that own the stock believe that Musk’s vision of a future in which its primary businesses are fully self-driving cars and robotics will make it a global artificial intelligence (AI) leader.\nMusk has made believers of what must be tens of thousands of shareholders with his story that there will be 40 million human-like robots in 2040. The price of these could be less than $20,000. That makes it hard to see how these could be affordable in the world’s poor countries.\nWhile Tesla has many competitors in the autonomous car business, Musk says it will be the worldwide leader. That means his service will need to be better than several in the United States, including Alphabet’s Waymo. The New York Times recently reported, “Shares of Tesla have hit new highs on optimism about the company’s self-driving taxis. But experts say Tesla is far behind Waymo, which has a big head start.” Several tech and car companies in China also say they have a head start.\n\nMost car industry experts do believe self-driving cars are the future of the auto and trucking sectors. How soon and who wins are part of an ongoing debate that will be settled by the market share of the companies already far along in the business.\nOften missing in the debate is that some legacy car company stocks have done nearly as well as Tesla over the past five years. General Motors Co. ( NYSE: GM ) stock is up by 102%.

      "Content": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nTesla (TSLA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this electric car maker have returned +13.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has gained 14.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share, indicating a change of -37% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.8% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.63 points to a change of -32.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.31 indicates a change of +42% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.7%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $24.76 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -3.7%. The $94.76 billion and $105.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3% and +11.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Tesla reported revenues of $28.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.6%. EPS of $0.5 for the same period compares with $0.72 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was -5.66%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk commented on the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions on five European officials, including former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton , a long-time critic who previously clashed with Musk over content regulation.\n“Tyranny Breton gets his dessert,” Musk posted on X, responding to reports of the U.S. travel bans.\nDon't Miss:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nDuring his tenure as EU Commissioner, Thierry Breton called on Musk to enforce the European Union's Digital Services Act , which sets EU-wide rules for online intermediaries such as social media platforms, marketplaces, and app stores, regarding online content moderation and platform responsibilities.\n\nEU Response The European Commission has condemned the U.S. decision. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States,\" the Commission stated.\nThe Commission emphasized on its sovereign right to regulate economic activity and said EU digital rules ensure a safe and fair environment for all companies.\n\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nIt has also requested clarifications from U.S. authorities and vowed to respond decisively to defend its regulatory autonomy.\nEU Council President Antonio Costa criticized the measures, calling them \"unacceptable between allies, partners, and friends.\"\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-recent-uk-megapack-deal-132000065.html",
      "Content": "Tesla's Recent UK Megapack Deal to Supercharge Its Energy Business\n\nRimmi Singhi\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla TSLA has secured a 1 GWh Megapack project with Matrix Renewables in Scotland. The project will be built in Eccles and will use a 500 MW, two-hour standalone battery energy storage system. For Matrix Renewables, this will be its first standalone battery storage project in the UK. For Tesla, it is another clear win in a market that has quietly become one of its strongest for energy storage.\n\nWhy the UK Deal Matters The UK grid is turning into a real-world test case for renewable power. As the country pushes toward its Net Zero 2050 goal and Clean Power 2035 ambition, it needs reliable ways to balance intermittent solar and wind generation. That is exactly where Tesla’s Megapack comes in. Large-scale batteries allow utilities to store excess energy when supply is high and release it when demand spikes. This makes renewables far more practical at scale.\n\nThe company has been ramping up production at its Lathrop Megafactory in California specifically to meet growing global demand for grid-scale storage. Last year, Tesla landed a massive multi-billion-dollar contract to deploy more than 15 GWh of Megapacks for Intersect Power in California.\nTesla Energy Is Doing What EVs Aren’t Right Now While Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) business is dealing with softer demand and pricing pressure, its energy segment is doing the opposite. Projects like this highlight why Tesla Energy and storage have become a bright spot for the company. This is thanks to the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products — lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall is designed to store energy for homes and small commercial facilities, while Megapack serves larger-scale energy needs for commercial, industrial and utility customers.\n\nThe numbers behind Tesla Energy are hard to ignore. Energy storage deployments have surged at a compound annual growth rate of 180% over the past three years. In 2024 alone, deployments jumped 113% year over year. CEO Musk expects deployments to grow another 50% at least for the full year. In the third quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage, up 81% year over year.\nJust as important, this growth is profitable. Tesla Energy became profitable in mid-2022 and has now delivered profits for 14 straight quarters. In 2024, the Energy Generation and Storage segment posted gross margins of 26%, the highest across Tesla’s businesses. Lower material costs and operating leverage are helping keep margins strong.\nAs power grids strain and renewables expand, Tesla’s energy business is becoming a core pillar — and right now, it may be the company’s most reliable source of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTSLA’s Competitors in This Space Fluence Energy FLNC and Enphase Energy ENPH are key competitors to Tesla’s energy and storage business.\nVirginia-based Fluence Energy is one of the global leaders in utility-scale energy storage and a direct competitor to Tesla’s Megapack. The company operates in a fast-growing market, driven by the global shift toward renewable energy. Fluence provides large-scale battery systems, AI-driven software, and grid services to utilities and energy developers worldwide. Its new Smartstack platform and partnership with Cordelio Power to deploy 1 GWh of domestically manufactured battery storage further strengthen its competitive position.\n\nEnphase Energy, headquartered in Fremont, CA, competes more closely with Tesla in the residential energy storage market. The company designs and sells home energy solutions that integrate energy generation, storage, monitoring, and control into a single intelligent platform. Known for its solar microinverters, Enphase has expanded into home battery systems, offering solar-plus-storage solutions that help homeowners reduce reliance on the grid and better manage energy consumption.\nTSLA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Tesla have gained around 12% over the past year, underperforming the industry.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, TSLA trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 15.27, way above the industry. It carries a Value Score of D.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSee how the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA's EPS has been revised over the past 90 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Will Rivian (RIVN) Stock Hit $50 by 2030?\n\nDavid Moadel\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:58 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nQuick Read Rivian Automotive’s (RIVN) revenue grew 78.3% year-over-year in Q3 2025, but its net loss increased by 6%.\nSince Rivian’s future growth depends heavily on unknown R2 SUV sales, it’s too soon to invest in RIVN stock with confidence.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIf you missed out on the multi-decade returns of Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) stock, maybe you'll get a second chance with electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive ( NASDAQ:RIVN ). For the next four to five years, some loyal RIVN stockholders hope to achieve Tesla-like growth.\nIn the most optimistic scenario, Rivian stock would stage a spectacular comeback and rally to $50 by 2030. However, in a more pessimistic scenario, Rivian could run out of money next year and file for bankruptcy.\nNo one knows for sure whether RIVN stock will become a hero or a zero by 2030. Still, you could have a huge winner on your hands with a share position in Rivian, so let's see what's under the hood with this fascinating EV producer.\nIs Rivian Stock the \"Comeback Kid\"? Whether Rivian stock is \"dead money\" or the \"comeback kid\" largely depends on your time frame. If your lookback period is five years, then the \"dead money\" theory seems to hold up.\nAlarmingly, RIVN stock has lost 80% of its value during the past five years. But then, the picture looks much brighter if we zoom in on the past 12 months.\n\nNow, the \"comeback kid\" theory is in effect as Rivian stock has gained 54% over the past year. In theory, if the stock continues to add 50% every year through 2030, then a $50 is an easy target price.\nThat's a highly ambitious projection, though. To be more informed and realistic, we need to delve into Rivian's actual results, so we'll do that right now.\nNo Imminent Danger After performing an inspection of Rivian's third-quarter 2025 results, we'll find that it's a good-news, bad-news situation. The good news is that Rivian's revenue surged 78.3% from $874 million in the year-earlier quarter to $1.558 billion in Q3 2025.\nOn the other hand, Rivian's cost of revenue and operating expenses also grew during that period. Consequently, the company's net loss increased 6% year-over-year, from $1.1 billion to $1.167 billion.\nFurthermore, Rivian's cash and cash equivalents declined from $5.294 billion as of December 31, 2024, to $4.441 billion as of September 30, 2025. It appears, then, that the company's capital position is dwindling but at least Rivian isn't in immediate danger of running of out cash.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's understandable that Rivian needs to spend money in the short term. For example, the company recently developed its artificial intelligence (AI) infused Rivian Autonomy Platform, which \"has been designed around an AI-centric end-to-end approach.\"\nThat said, we can't disregard the fact that Rivian is still a money-losing operation. Until the company's capital outlays on AI technology and other investments translate to substantial profits, it may be difficult to invest in Rivian with complete confidence.\n\nIt's All About the R2 Now Although Rivian offers an R1T electric pickup truck, the automaker's future will evidently \"ride or die\" on the upcoming R2 SUV model. By all indications, Rivian's success or failure through 2030 could depend on the R2.\nIn the company's Q3 2025 press release, Rivian declared that the R2 model's \"progress remains on track for deliveries in the first half of 2026.\" A great deal of buzz on financial social media appears to be centered around this much-hyped SUV launch.\n\nIn other words, if Rivian's R2 launch next year is a letdown, it will be quite difficult for RIVN stock to hit $50 by 2030. Indeed, the next four to five years could be painful for Rivian's loyal shareholders.\nFor what it's worth, Car and Driver 's write-up on the upcoming Rivian R2 makes the SUV model sound highly appealing. With a starting price of $45,000, the R2 might actually be able to compete with Tesla's Model Y.\nIn case you're curious, the longest-range R2 is expected to provide more than 300 miles of range. Also, one version of the R2 is anticipated to accelerate to 60 miles per hour in under 3 seconds.\nDon't Get Your Hopes Up The range and speed stats for Rivian's R2 SUV are all well and good, but they don't guarantee strong sales. For all we know, next year's R2 launch could be a success or a bust.\nFrankly, it's worrisome that the R2 launch will be, to a certain extent, make-or-break for Rivian in 2026. If the R2 gets off on the wrong foot, Rivian's path to recovery through 2030 will be unclear.\n\nThus, without the R2 sales data in hand right now, it's too optimistic to expect RIVN stock to zoom from its current price of around $21 to $50 by 2030. Rivian isn't in imminent risk of bankruptcy, but the wise move is to keep your position size in Rivian stock small if you choose to invest at all.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

Groq in a statement said that Nvidia entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the startup’s inference technology.“The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low cost inference,” it said. CNBC reported that the deal include an asset purchase worth $20 billion in cash, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led a $750 million fundraising round for the startup.The move comes as AI stocks have been moving higher to end the year. Nvidia shares were higher by 0.6% in premarket trading.\n\nStory Continues\nFederal Regulators Probe Tesla Door Release Issue The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it earlier this week opened an investigation into Tesla ( TSLA ) after it received a petition saying the mechanical door release for the 2022 Tesla Model 3 wasn’t easily accessible. “The petition cites allegations that the mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive to locate during an emergency,” the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation said. The issue is expected to affect about 179,000 vehicles. The NHTSA had opened other investigations into Tesla , including a probe on electronic door lock issues with a different model. Tesla shares ticked higher in premarket trading.\nNike Shares Continue Rise After Apple CEO Stock Purchase Nike ( NKE ) shares continued to rise in premarket trading after the athletic apparel maker helped lead stocks higher in Wednesday’s session.

      "Content": "US Safety Regulator Opens New Probe Into Tesla Model 3 Doors\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:41 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nTesla Inc. ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) is facing renewed regulatory attention after US auto safety officials said they are evaluating complaints tied to emergency door releases in certain Model 3 vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it is reviewing a petition that argues the mechanical emergency release can be hidden, unlabeled, and difficult to locate during an emergency, stemming from a 2023 incident involving a Tesla owner in Georgia. The agency emphasized it has not yet decided whether to grant or deny the petition, which applies to an estimated 179,071 Model 3 sedans from the 2022 model year.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe review broadens federal scrutiny of Tesla's door systems following heightened attention on electric door handles that can stop functioning, particularly after crashes or power loss. A recent Bloomberg investigation detailed multiple incidents over the past decade in which occupants or rescuers were unable to open Tesla doors after accidents, including cases involving fires. In September, NHTSA also opened a separate investigation into certain Model Y SUVs after reports that children became trapped when the 12-volt battery failed, keeping Tesla's two top-selling models under active regulatory review.\nBloomberg has reported that potential safety concerns tied to electric door handles were raised internally during the development of the Model 3, with manual emergency releases added to address power-loss scenarios. The latest petition references a case in which the owner said he was unaware of the emergency release location and ultimately escaped by breaking a rear passenger window while the interior was burning. Tesla and NHTSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and the ongoing evaluation could keep questions around vehicle safety design in focus as regulators consider possible next steps.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "From Gates to Musk: Net Worth of Richest American from 1995 to 2025\n\nTravis Woods\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:10 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMSFT\n\nRecently, Tesla CEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk became the first person to gain a net worth over $400 billion, having added $184 billion to his preexisting wealth thanks to a 56% boost in Tesla stock. That extraordinary leap in wealth has also made Musk the wealthiest American citizen (in addition to the richest person on Earth) for the fourth year in a row.\n\nWhile Musk’s total net worth of over $750 billion certainly makes him the richest American, there was a time when a mere $15 billion would have been the highest net worth in the country. Specifically, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ net worth of $15 billion made him wealthiest American back in 1995. That stunning disparity between 1995 and 2025 highlights the massive consolidation of wealth that has occurred at society’s highest levels, in which the 20 richest Americans have collectively amassed $3 trillion.\nBy tracing the arc of the richest Americans over the last 30 years, you can watch as the country’s wealth accumulates and increases around a very small group of individuals — three tech-driven entrepreneurs whose companies have helped reshape American society just as they have collected most of the country’s wealth. Those three men are, per Forbes : Gates, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk. Their accretion of wealth has leapt from $15 billion to a shocking $751.9 billion (as of Dec. 24), and that number is only expected to increase as Musk is on track to becoming America’s — and the world’s — first trillionaire .\n1995: Bill Gates Net worth : $15 billion\nFind Out: If the Top 10 Billionaires’ Wealth Was Distributed Equally in America, How Much Money Would Each Person Get?\nRead Next: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n1996: Bill Gates Net worth : $18.5 billion\nFor You: 6 Money Moves Wealthy People Always Make Before New Year’s\n1997: Bill Gates Net worth : $40 billion\n1998: Bill Gates Net worth : $58 billion\n1999: Bill Gates Net worth : $85 billion\n2000: Bill Gates Net worth : $63 billion\nCheck Out: 5 Key Mindset Shifts To Financially Become the Top 1%, According to Humphrey Yang\n2001: Bill Gates Net worth : $54 billion\n2002: Bill Gates Net worth : $43 billion\n2003: Bill Gates Net worth : $46 billion\n2004: Bill Gates Net worth : $48 billion\nDiscover More: If Mark Zuckerberg’s Wealth Were Evenly Distributed Across America, How Much Money Would Every Person Get?\n2005: Bill Gates Net worth : $51 billion\n2006: Bill Gates Net worth : $56 billion\n2007: Bill Gates Net worth : $59 billion\n2008: Bill Gates Net worth : $57 billion\nBe Aware: What Class Do You Actually Belong To?

      "Content": "Rivian Stock Spiked 67% in 2025. Here's Why 2026 Could Be Even More Profitable for Investors.\n\nRyan Vanzo, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Rivian Automotive should achieve huge scale in 2026.\nIts first model priced under $50,000 is nearing launch.\nFinancial stability should help it close the gap with Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock has performed very well thus far in 2025. Shares are up nearly 70% since the year began, with nearly all of those gains booked over the past month or two. Why is the market suddenly so bullish on Rivian stock?\n\nThere are two reasons: artificial intelligence ( AI) and new, cheaper models. We'll discuss both of these catalysts in a moment. But the important takeaway here is that Rivian as a business is reaching a critical inflection point. Next year could be transformational for the company, with Rivian achieving what few electric vehicle ( EV) stocks have achieved in the history of EVs.\nThis is why electric car stocks fail Over the past decade, more than 30 EV companies have gone under. The reason for these failures is obvious if you look under the hood. Starting an EV manufacturing business takes more than just a good idea -- it takes billions of dollars.\nHuge amounts of infrastructure need to be designed and built to manufacture the cars themselves. And given massive increases in car technology, car makers must also either develop their own proprietary software stacks or pay third parties to license their technologies.\n\nFrom idea to actual production, the process of getting an EV business up and running can easily take more than a decade, plus huge amounts of capital. Investors must be comfortable with putting more and more cash into a money-losing business for years at a time. Given these struggles, it's no wonder that the vast majority of EV businesses never take off. They all, at one point or another, simply run out of capital.\nThis is what makes Tesla so formidable right now. Few, if any, automakers in the world can raise fresh cash as easily as Tesla. The company can raise $30 billion in new capital, for instance -- more than Rivian's entire market cap -- by diluting shareholders by just 2%. Even if Tesla makes several major stumbles, it is extremely unlikely that it will go out of business. This is something almost no other EV company can claim.\nTo match Tesla's success, other EV stocks must reach the inflection point at which raising capital is no longer a desperate concern. This inflection point could arrive for Rivian as early as next year thanks to two catalysts.\nRivian has 2 major catalysts in 2026 Right now, Rivian is still very dependent on investors to remain solvent. The company has forged a multibillion-dollar agreement with Volkswagen , assuaging some of the capital concerns. But the company continues to lose money every quarter, only recently achieving positive gross margins.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat can Rivian do to finally shed the shackles of needing capital markets to survive? The biggest achievement, of course, would be generating a net profit. To do that, the company needs to achieve much greater scale than it has achieved thus far with just two models: the R1T and R1S. Both of those vehicles can easily cost more than $100,000 based on options, relegating them to a tiny fraction of the overall car-buying market.\n\nIn early 2026, however, Rivian expects to begin production of the R2 -- its first model priced under $50,000. Two other affordable models are expected to follow, making Rivian vehicles accessible for the first time to tens of millions of new buyers. In addition, the design of the R2 has created new manufacturing efficiencies that will lower costs for Rivian's existing vehicles, further improving margins.\nWhile positive net profit margins may not be realized in the 2026 fiscal year, these new models should help Rivian achieve significantly better scale in the years to come, giving the company its best chance yet at becoming financially sustainable on its own. Over the short term, the market has finally realized Rivian's potential as an AI stock, bidding up its share price by more than 70% over the past month and a half.\n\nThis will make it easier for the company to raise money for next year's catalysts to be realized. Right now, few EV stocks are financially sustainable without tapping external capital markets. Next year, Rivian could be added to that list, giving the stock a newfound premium versus smaller, lesser financed competitors.\nShould you buy stock in Rivian Automotive right now?

VanEck and 21Shares analysts recently published fresh overviews of the broader crypto market and the specific Bitcoin situation.\nBoth firms are basically saying the same thing: The four-year Bitcoin halving cycle still matters symbolically, but it's no longer the engine that drives crypto prices higher over time.\n\nA few themes stood out in their reports:\nBitcoin's annual issuance is now below 1% -- less than gold's inflation rate. That's a nice, symbolic milestone, but also a sign that the upcoming halvings will carry less power. Each halving cuts the mining rewards by less, because there's less left to cut. That's just mathematics.\nThe buyers have changed. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate treasuries, and sovereign governments absorbed more than the total number of mined Bitcoins in 2025. This is patient, sticky capital setting up shop -- not retail FOMO-chasers looking at charting indicators.\nBitcoin's volatility is compressing. The recent drawdowns stopped at 30%, compared to 60% wipeouts (and more) in the first three cycles. Bitcoin is launching fewer moonshots, but fewer face-melting crashes too. In other words, it's starting to behave like a mature financial asset, earning its \"digital gold\" moniker.\n\nBitcoin's bull case Crypto isn't just for enthusiasts anymore. Deep-pocketed investors are building large Bitcoin positions, led by Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) and its 671,268 coins. At today's prices, that's a $58.9 billion Bitcoin portfolio.\nEleven other companies have converted at least $1 billion of cash into Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. The list includes Bitcoin miners like MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms , but also Elon Musk's Tesla and the Trump Media & Technology Group .\n\nStory Continues\nTraditional banks and financial services are still nowhere to be found among the 100 largest Bitcoin holders, but 2026 could change that. With easy access to spot Bitcoin ETFs, cash managers can add Bitcoin exposure to their balance sheets through ordinary stock-trading channels.\nAccording to 21Shares, about 7% of the Bitcoins in circulation already sit in ETF portfolios. That ratio should increase in the coming years, as massive investment services like Morgan Stanley are allowed to recommend Bitcoin funds.\n\nAnd let's not forget about Bitcoin's potential as a hedge against macroeconomic jitters. As of Dec. 23, gold prices are up by 71% year to date, far outpacing a 16% gain for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index. Investors are starving for safe havens. If Bitcoin can connect to just a small slice of that gigantic market, it would chip away at the glittery metal's $31 trillion of total market value.\nThe charts from earlier halving periods couldn't predict any of this, because the market dynamics have changed with ETFs and institutional investors at the table. Things really are different this time.\nBitcoin's bear case It's not all moonshots and rainbows, of course.\nThe institutional investor activity also brings some drawbacks. Bitcoin isn't seeing a groundswell of organic network growth in 2025, and the number of people who own the currency isn't rising. The main idea in the Bitcoin white paper was to supply a radically different digital currency to the masses, but the ownership is getting centralized these days.\n\nBitcoin miners essentially convert electric power into digital coins, but artificial intelligence (AI) systems also use a lot of power. Leading Bitcoin miners are picking up AI computing as a lucrative side gig , diverting electricity and other resources from the crypto business.\nAnd that safe-haven plan is still an academic idea with no real proof. Take the global inflation crisis of 2022, for example. The S&P 500 fell as much as 25% as the drama played out. Gold played its expected stabilizer role and stopped at a 20% loss, but Bitcoin dropped 77% lower.\nAmong these three options, gold has been the best asset to hold since November 2021:\nHow to play Bitcoin in 2026 The bulls and the bears brought their A-games to this fight. Both skeptics and Bitcoin maximalists are leaning on some solid arguments right now.\nI see Bitcoin as a great long-term investment. It's OK if the next crypto winter arrives earlier than expected. In the long run, organic demand for this alternative currency should grow while the supply remains almost unchanged. This thesis is taking a break right now, but it should be temporary. As such, I don't mind doubling down on my Bitcoin holdings when prices are down.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin remains a volatile and unpredictable asset. Unlike Strategy chairman Mike Saylor, I'm not betting the farm, the tractor, and all my chickens on this single idea.\nAbout 5% of my diversified investment portfolio is allocated to Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and crypto-based ETFs. I might increase that ratio to 8% or even 10% next year, but that's about it. You have to account for the risks, threats, and downsides, too.\nShould you buy stock in Bitcoin right now?

      "Content": "Why 2026 Will Be the Year of the Tesla Robotaxi\n\nLee Samaha, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Tesla plans to begin Cybercab production in 2026, but it still needs key regulatory approvals for the vehicles to operate.\nThe case for robotaxis is strong, but Tesla's autonomous vehicles may take longer than expected to get regulatory clearance.\nThe company also plans to begin production of the Tesla Semi and Optimus robot in 2026.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nAt Tesla 's (NASDAQ: TSLA) recent annual general meeting, CEO Elon Musk said the company is gearing up to start production of three new products in 2026: the Tesla Semi, a class 8 semi-trailer truck; the Optimus robot; and its dedicated robotaxi, the Cybercab. So it's set to be an exciting year for the company all around, but by far the most crucial development will be its robotaxi service, which will be built around the Cybercab. That business has the most significant prospects for positively impacting the stock price in the coming year.\nTesla's plans for 2026 Musk has said publicly that he believes that in the future, 80% of the company's value could come from Optimus. He has also asserted that the Tesla Semi could revolutionize the heavy-duty truck market if it achieves on a wider scale the kind of efficiency gains and cost reductions it did in the trial of the vehicle conducted by PepsiCo .\n\nYet as exciting as they are, Optimus and the Tesla Semi are likely to have far less dramatic near-term impacts than Tesla's robotaxi ambitions.\nTesla's robotaxi: risk and reward One of the market's most prominent Tesla bulls, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, says that her firm expects that 88% of Tesla's enterprise value will derive from robotaxis in 2029, compared to just 9% from electric vehicles (EVs). That's unlikely, not least because Ark's median case expectation calls for the robotaxi service to roll out in late 2025, and Tesla has yet to operate its robotaxis commercially without safety drivers as backups. Nor has it started manufacturing Cybercabs -- the vehicles currently being used for the service are Model Y's. Still, it indicates the massive potential for a recurring stream of ride-hailing revenue to drive value for the business.\n\nHowever, to get there, Tesla will need to start mass-producing Cybercabs, and also convince Tesla owners to convert their vehicles into part-time robotaxis using unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software. Tesla plans to begin Cybercab production in April and continue developing its FSD solutions. It also hopes to earn regulatory approvals for supervised FSD in Europe in 2026 – hopefully as early as February. That would help it raise consumer awareness of FSD and support a potential robotaxi deployment in the future.\n\nStory Continues\nThat said, there are two potential flies in the ointment here:\nTesla's vehicles have not been approved for unsupervised FSD yet, so Tesla owners who want to earn money by allowing their vehicles to participate in the robotaxi service aren't able to do so.\nTesla's plan to aggressively ramp up Cybercab production won't make sense if it doesn't receive unsupervised robotaxi approval. Cybercabs don't have steering wheels or pedals. Hence, having a safety driver on board as a backup is not an option.\n\nConsequently, while the potential of the robotaxi service is rising, so is the risk that Tesla will ramp up Cybercab production and capital expenditures without having the necessary regulatory approvals, or at least, enough approvals to justify the ramp.\nWhat management said on the matter Musk was asked about the potential for a mismatch between Cybercab production and regulatory approvals at the recent annual general meeting. He responded that \"the rate at which we receive regulatory approval will roughly match the rate of Cybercab production.\"\nHe went on to say that \"the regulators will have just fewer and fewer reasons to say no,\" based on favorable accident statistics. He also pointed to the deployment of rival Waymo's robotaxis as a development that is helping pave the way for social acceptance of autonomous vehicles.\nMusk is right that Waymo's deployment and Tesla's robotaxi rollout in Austin are increasing the chances of wider approval for autonomous vehicles. However, what's more questionable is the assumption that the early approvals for Tesla's vehicles to operate as unsupervised robotaxis (if there are any) will cover large enough populations and areas to justify the mass production of Cybercabs starting in April.\n\nThe year of the robotaxi As such, investors should be skeptical of the idea that Cybercabs will be a common sight on U.S. streets in the second half of 2026. That said, Tesla is making progress with its robotaxi rollout, and driverless robotaxis are already being tested (without passengers) in Austin.\nMoreover, while critics argue that Tesla has hardly any robotaxi safety data available, because it wasn't until recently that it had any robotaxis in service without safety drivers, the reality is that Tesla has 6.9 billion miles of data from Teslas driven with supervised FSD that indicate those systems achieve substantially better safety performance than human drivers.\n\nAll told, 2026 will be the year of Tesla's robotaxi, but don't be surprised if developments don't unfold linearly throughout the year. Tesla shareholders have good reason to be optimistic about 2026, but they will need to be patient.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Lucid Touches All-Time Lows. Is It Finally Time for Investors to Risk Buying?\n\nDaniel Miller, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LCID\n\nTSLA\n\nRIVN\n\nKey Points Lucid has shed roughly 50% of its value this year, while Rivian and Tesla have posted significant gains.\nLucid sent a message to investors acknowledging a rough period but promising transparency and strong liquidity.\nAfter the third quarter, Lucid made a couple of moves to improve its financial flexibility without much dilution.\n10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›\nLucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID) , Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are all well-known young electric vehicle (EV) makers, and they almost certainly have more in common than not. However, you wouldn't be able to discern that from simply looking at a price chart over the past six months.\nTSLA data by YCharts\nIt's clear that investors are getting a little cautious about jumping on the bandwagon for Lucid stock, even after the automaker has posted seven consecutive quarters of record deliveries and continues to ramp up production of its recently launched Gravity. With Lucid touching all-time lows last week, is it time for investors to take on the risk for its potential upside as the EV maker slowly gains traction in the coming years?\n\nMessage from Lucid It's been far from an ideal scenario for Lucid recently as it faces headwinds in the U.S. market at a critical time for the Gravity to help drive the company into the next phase of growth. Lucid has had to deal with tariffs on automotive vehicle and part imports, changing policies and regulations, and the removal of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, among other factors. But with the stock touching all-time lows, the company had a message for its investors.\n\n\"We know it's been a challenging period for our long-term holders,\" said Lucid's head of communications, Nick Twork, according to news site Electrek. He added, \"We are focused on execution and being transparent.\" Twork reaffirmed that Lucid has \"a strong liquidity runway.\"\nLet's touch on the last point from Twork, as Lucid has made a couple of moves to shore up the company's liquidity. The first was raising $975 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2031. It used roughly $750 million of those net proceeds to repurchase roughly the same amount of its convertible senior notes outstanding due 2026, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe move will essentially kick some of the company's obligations down the road, providing more financial flexibility as Lucid enters an important growth phase with Gravity production accelerating and a family of midsize SUVs on the way late next year.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, some investors may have missed this tidbit: The automaker announced after the end of the quarter that the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, and Lucid had reached an agreement to increase an untapped credit line from roughly $750 million to roughly $2 billion. That would have bumped Lucid's total liquidity at quarter's end to about $5.5 billion, giving it funding that should last into 2027.\n\nWhat it all means The major takeaway for investors is that these moves will increase the company's liquidity with only a minor amount of shareholder dilution -- which is a primary concern, considering past capital raises, as you can see in the comparison to Rivian below.\nRIVN Shares Outstanding data by YCharts\nAlthough this is good news for investors, the reality is that Lucid's cash burn problems aren't fading anytime soon. It's also fair for investors to be wary of Saudi Arabia's PIF's roughly 60% control of the company. It's great to have its support, but could turn into a nightmare if the PIF decides to cut its losses and move in a different direction. The selling pressure alone would weigh on the stock, and additional capital would likely be more expensive to raise.\n\nFor most investors, Lucid is simply far too risky to invest in currently, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Lucid's deliveries are still gaining momentum, and it has funding to last through the launch of its midsize platform, and if the young EV maker can execute those launches and the product is in demand with car shoppers, that's when investors can start considering a small position in a theoretically more balanced and stable young automaker.\nShould you buy stock in Lucid Group right now?

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) is one of the best high volume stocks to buy right now . On December 19, Deutsche Bank raised the firm’s price target on Tesla to $500 from $470 with a Buy rating on the shares. This upward adjustment was driven by the firm's latest analysis of Tesla’s Q4 2025 delivery performance.\n\nOn the same day, Truist analyst William Stein raised the firm’s price target on Tesla to $444 from $406 with a Hold rating on the shares. Truist updated its price targets within the semiconductor and AI sectors following the establishment of its 2027 financial estimates. The firm acknowledged significant headwinds, specifically the difficulty of securing both the electrical power required for AI infrastructure and the capital to fund these massive projects. Despite these challenges, Truist remains bullish and asserts that AI infrastructure semiconductor stocks are still undervalued relative to their projected growth. The firm anticipates greater upward pressure on earnings estimates for AI-focused companies and expects the continued surge in AI capital expenditure in 2026.\nEarlier on December 17, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Neutral rating for Tesla with a $400 price target. The firm is monitoring potential regulatory hurdles in California, where state authorities have warned that Tesla faces a 30-day sales suspension if it does not adjust the marketing of its Autopilot system. This order is currently stayed for 90 days to allow the company time to comply. However, Goldman Sachs still anticipates minimal risk to Tesla’s overall sales volume.\n\nTesla Inc.

For comparison, the tracker showcases over 63 vehicles belonging to Alphabet Inc.

The testing operations could provide a major boost to the company's pursuit of achieving driverless operations in the city by the end of the year.\nA Tesla Cybercab was also spotted testing in Austin recently, though it wasn't clear if the car was being driven by a human driver or if it was operating autonomously.\n\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nWaymo's Progress Meanwhile, Waymo has recorded significant progress in the Robotaxi sector.

Most of them are straight tech companies that are deeply involved in creating artificial intelligence infrastructure, hardware, or software that either makes AI work better or provides unique services.\n\nThen there's an automotive company, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , that is the leading manufacturer of EVs and rode a wave of investor enthusiasm to be the biggest automaker in the world by market capitalization. Tesla currently has a market value of $1.6 trillion.\nBut Tesla has had an interesting year as CEO Elon Musk watched auto sales (and profits) drop. He got involved in domestic and global politics, and the company's still feeling the effects of that. Competition is fierce, and it's a challenging time to be an automaker.\nHowever, Tesla is much more than just a car company. It has massive AI aspirations of its own, and that's why Tesla is my fifth-ranked Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026.\nThis is the third in a series of articles ranking the best Magnificent Seven stocks -- the grouping of companies that collectively represent one-third of the weighting of the S&P 500 , and therefore have an oversize impact on the stock market. In previous articles, I discussed why Apple is No. 7 on the list , and Amazon took the sixth spot.\nHere's a closer look at Tesla and why it's deserving of the No. 5 ranking.\nAbout Tesla stock Tesla makes most of its money selling electric vehicles. But the problem is that it's not selling as many cars now as it did in previous years.\nYes, third-quarter sales set company records for deliveries with 497,099 vehicles. But that was attributed to a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that expired on Sept. 30 -- customers merely accelerated their purchases to beat the deadline.\nMetric\nQ1 2025\nQ2 2025\nQ3 2025\nAutomotive deliveries\n336,681\n384,112\n497,099\nYear-over-year change\n(13%)\n(13%)\n7%\n\nSource: Tesla\n\nThat had a dramatic impact on Tesla's revenue numbers, which saw massive drops in the first two quarters of the year.\nMetric\nQ1 2025\nQ2 2025\nQ3 2025\nAutomotive revenues\n$17.38 billion\n$19.88 billion\n$20.02 billion\nYear-over-year change\n(20%)\n(16%)\n6%\nTotal revenue\n$21.30 billion\n$25.50 billion\n$25.18 billion\nYear-over-year change\n(9%)\n(12%)\n12%\n\nSource: Tesla\n\nStory Continues\nAnd to make things even worse, Tesla's profit margins dropped during the same period, as competition from other automakers forced Tesla to lower its prices.\nMetric\nQ1 2025\nQ2 2025\nQ3 2025\nOperating margin\n2.1%\n4.1%\n5.8%\nYear-over-year change\n(343 bp)\n(219 bp)\n(501 bp)\n\nSource: Tesla\n\nBut competition is only part of the problem. Tesla faced severe blowback this year after Musk leapt wholeheartedly into politics, pouring millions of dollars into President Donald Trump's successful campaign and appearing with him at several events. Musk spent the first several months of Trump's second term as a close confidant, running the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with a mission to reduce the size of government.\n\nDOGE was short-lived, as was Musk's Washington career, but the damage was done. Musk has publicly lamented that his federal government role hurt his companies, including Tesla. A study by Yale University professors concluded that Musk's political activities in the U.S. cost Tesla more than 1 million vehicle sales.\nWhat's changing for Tesla in 2026 I admit, there's a lot to unpack about Tesla, and this is why the stock has been a disappointment for much of the year. But it's also important to acknowledge that the company is building some serious momentum, leading to a sharp 13% gain in stock price over the last three months.\nBecause Tesla is developing an AI product of its own with its full self-driving (FSD) software that some analysts believe will be a revolutionary change for the industry. Tesla's newly updated software makes its Robotaxi app downloadable on iOS in the U.S. and Canada and is a significant step toward allowing Tesla users to one day to monetize their Teslas by making them available as robotaxis when they aren't in use.\n\nMelius Research has predicted that Tesla is approaching a tipping point in FSD software in which incremental progress will \"suddenly\" give way to mass adoption of autonomous driving. When widespread rollout arrives with Teslas suddenly on the roads as robotaxis, \"it will still shock most people,\" analyst Rob Wertheimer wrote in a research note.\nMusk said that Tesla will be in a position to expand its production when that happens. \"We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars,\" he told analysts. \"You know, we're making a couple million a year. In fact, with the advent of what we see now as a clarity on achieving full self-driving, unsupervised full self-driving, I should say, I feel confident in expanding Tesla's production. That is our intent to expand as quickly as we can our future production.\"\n\nWhy Tesla is No. 5 Tesla is still working on turning full self-driving into autonomous driving, but as Wertheimer writes, it's making rapid progress and already has a fleet of millions of cars at its disposal to flood the market.\nAnd we've not even talked about Tesla's other massive opportunity -- the Tesla Optimus autonomous robot that Musk is attempting to develop for use in homes and factories. Musk, when negotiating a massive shareholder-approved pay raise this year, repeatedly referred to his \"robot army\" as a potential source of tireless unpaid labor that can be trained to do nearly anything. Part of Musk's massive incentive plan at Tesla, which is valued at as much as $1 trillion with stock options, is contingent on his successfully building 1 million Optimus robots.\n\nSo, there's a lot going on with Tesla. As I said, it's not just a vehicle company. I don't expect Tesla to dramatically improve its margins in 2026, but I will be watching closely as the company continues its AI work. I believe 2026 will be a good year for investors to begin accumulating Tesla stock in advance of what could be a seminal moment for Musk and his company.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk weighed in on an AI debate, siding with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis after Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: META ) outgoing AI chief Yann LeCun dismissed the idea of \"general intelligence\" as an illusion.\n\nMusk Weighs In On AGI Debate Musk amplified Hassabis' rebuttal to LeCun in a post on X , writing simply, \"Demis is right,\" throwing his support behind the DeepMind chief in a widening public dispute over whether artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a meaningful concept.\nThe exchange underscores growing divisions among leading AI researchers over how intelligence should be defined — and whether human intelligence itself can be considered \"general.\"\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nHassabis Says Brains Are Fundamentally General Hassabis pushed back strongly against LeCun's statement that there is \"no such thing as general intelligence,\" arguing that LeCun is conflating general intelligence with the idea of universal intelligence.\nIn a detailed post, Hassabis said human brains are among the most complex systems known and are, by design, highly general learning machines.\n\nWhile acknowledging that no real-world system can escape some degree of specialization, he said the architecture of the human brain — much like modern AI foundation models — is capable of learning any computable task in theory, given sufficient time, memory and data.\nHe added that humanity's ability to invent chess, science and modern engineering, despite evolving for survival tasks like hunting and gathering, demonstrates the breadth of human intelligence rather than its limits.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nLeCun Calls Humans Extremely Specialized LeCun also responded to Hassabis' criticism, saying the disagreement is largely semantic.\n\nStory Continues\nHe objected to equating \"general\" with \"human-level,\" arguing that humans are deeply specialized systems optimized for efficiency in narrow domains.\nWhile conceding that the human brain is theoretically Turing complete, LeCun said it is highly inefficient for most computational problems under real-world constraints.\nHe also argued that the brain can represent only a vanishingly small fraction of all possible functions, making true generality impossible in practice.\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

(NYSE: CRM ) CEO Marc Benioff , who is investing billions in AI, said the reality of AGI falls short of the hype .\nOn the other hand, Hassabis has earlier predicted that there is roughly a 50% chance that AGI emerges within the next five years.\n\nAnthropic co-founder Ben Mann has said AGI could be reached by 2028. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also suggested AGI could arrive during President Donald Trump's term in office.\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt echoed that view at an April fireside chat, saying it is reasonable to expect AGI to emerge sometime between 2028 and 2030.\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

It's according to Reuters. Nvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process. This highlights a pain point for Intel amid its struggling manufacturing business. Nvidia, remember, earlier this year invested $5 billion in Intel, but did not commit to using its chip manufacturing services.\n00:36 Speaker A\nUp next, take a look at Tesla as the company faces a new investigation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is launching a probe into the EV Maker's Model 3 compact sedans. This comes amid concerns that emergency door release controls may not be easily accessible or clearly identifiable. The focus of this investigation is on model year 2022 electric vehicles. The US auto safety regulator has also been looking into Tesla's advanced driver assistance system over alleged violations of traffic safety laws.\n01:17 Speaker A\nAnd lastly, let's check a check here on crypto. Bitcoin continues to slip missing out on the broader seasonal optimism. The world's largest cryptocurrency stalling here between 85,000 to 90,000 range. The slump in the digital asset follows a turbulent couple of months as crypto struggles to regain its footing after falling sharply from its record high back in early October.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The move stems from a petition filed by Kevin Clouse, a Tesla owner in Georgia who says he was trapped in his vehicle in 2023 and requested a defect investigation. NHTSA said it hasn’t decided whether to grant or deny the petition.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

In September, NHTSA opened an investigation into whether the doors are defective in certain Model Y SUVs amid reports of children stuck in vehicles when the 12-volt battery dies. The Model 3 and Model Y are by far Tesla’s top-selling vehicles.\n\nThe automaker was a pioneer of electrically powered handles, which can stop functioning without warning, particularly after a crash. A Bloomberg analysis this week found at least 15 deaths in a dozen incidents over the past decade in which occupants or rescuers were unable to open the doors of a Tesla that had crashed and caught fire.\nBloomberg separately reported that potential safety issues with electric handles were raised with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk during the development of the Model 3, and that he insisted on the futuristic design, which would include manual releases to mitigate power-loss problems.\nClouse filed a petition last month over a 2023 incident in which he says he had to kick his way out of his burning Model 3 when the doors wouldn’t open. Bloomberg previously cited details of Clouse’s case.\n\n“I was unaware of the location of the hidden mechanical emergency door release because it is not visibly labeled, not explained upon delivery, and not intuitive in an emergency,” he said in a complaint filed with NHTSA. “I was forced to climb to the back seat and break the rear passenger window with my legs to escape while the interior was burning.”\n\nStory Continues\nTesla shares fell 0.7% as of 11:41 a.m. Wednesday in New York.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Last week, Wood trimmed her exposure to Tesla (TSLA), sparking fresh debate about whether the electric vehicle and AI giant is still a buy at current levels or if it's time to dump the stock.\n\nWhat Exactly Did Cathie Wood Do? According to disclosures, Wood sold 23,110 shares of Tesla through ARK Invest’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), generating roughly $11.2 million. The sale came shortly after Tesla shares pulled back from record highs earlier in the week. Importantly, this was not a wholesale exit. ARK remains a major Tesla shareholder, with Tesla holding 11.9% weightage, and the transaction appears to be a partial profit-taking move rather than a change in Wood’s long-term thesis. Even after the sale, TSLA stock is up 18% year-to-date (YTD), slightly outperforming the broader market.\n\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\n$800 for Tesla Stock Could Be Reality in 2026. Here’s Why.\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nTesla has been unusually volatile in recent weeks. The stock surged to new highs soon after its Q3 earnings as optimism around full self-driving (FSD), robotaxis, AI chips, and humanoid robots intensified. At the same time, concerns about valuation have grown, making investors and analysts skeptical as Tesla’s core business continues to struggle.\n\nTesla continues to frame itself less as a carmaker and more as a real-world AI platform. In the third quarter, CEO Elon Musk emphasized several long-term drivers. Tesla is expanding robotaxi operations and expects broader deployment as regulatory approvals come through. Second, the Optimus humanoid robot remains a high-risk, high-reward bet, but one Tesla believes could redefine its future revenue mix.\nDespite enthusiasm around Tesla’s AI roadmap, investors cannot ignore the challenges facing its core businesses. In the third quarter, revenue rose roughly 12% year-over-year (YoY) to about $28.1 billion, while vehicle deliveries increased 7.4% to just over 497,000 units. Growth is still present, but it is slowing. Adjusted earnings per share fell 31% YoY, and gross margin declined to 18% as continued price cuts weighed heavily on results. Competition is intensifying, particularly from low-cost Chinese EV manufacturers that are rapidly improving technology while undercutting Tesla on price. Nonetheless, Tesla continues to generate substantial free cash flow ($4 billion in Q3) and maintains a large cash balance ($41 billion) to fund aggressive expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nShould You Follow Cathy Wood’s Move? For most investors, this move should be considered portfolio management, not a bearish signal. Wood did not abandon Tesla. Her portfolio simply reduced exposure after a strong rally. The fact that Tesla shares continued to climb even as ARK sold suggests broader market demand remains strong.\nThat said, Tesla’s stock price already reflects a lot of optimism. Trading at 221 times forward earnings, TSLA stock is expensive. Expectations around autonomy, AI, and robotics are high, and any delays or regulatory setbacks could lead to sharp pullbacks. Long-term investors who believe Tesla will successfully monetize autonomy, AI, and robotics might find any pullbacks as buying opportunities.\n\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About TSLA Stock? Wall Street’s stance on Tesla is mixed, with an overall “Hold” rating. Of the 40 analysts covering the stock, 14 rate it a “Strong Buy,” one assigns a “Moderate Buy,” 16 recommend a “Hold,” and nine advise “Strong Sell.” Tesla has already moved above its average analyst price target of $389.76, while the high price target of $600 implies upside of about 25% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/dc451017-b4cb-36b3-a7b8-5d0c1840048e/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-under.html",
      "Content": "Is Tesla Stock a Buy Under $500?\n\nJabran Kundi\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:42 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock is closing in on the $500 mark. The recent rally was sparked by a reported Waymo outage, which left many of the company’s autonomous vehicles stranded on the streets. This brought back attention to Elon Musk’s full self-driving and autonomy. With the stock struggling to break the $500 barrier in the last week’s trading, investors have started wondering whether it is a psychological resistance and therefore worth selling the stock in the short term.\n\nThe arguments for buying or selling the stock are both valid. Tesla’s valuation is so high that it almost doesn’t make any sense. Yet the company is developing technology that could significantly alter the way we pursue work and live our lives. It comes down to whether someone is investing in the short term or for the long run. The $500 level is behaving like a profit-taking level, so the bearish case remains strong. If one can ignore this short-term investor behavior, the same level could very well be a stepping stone to a multi-trillion-dollar valuation.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nBroadcom (AVGO) Stock Options Are Signaling Pensiveness. Here’s Why the Fear Might Be Unwarranted.\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nAbout Tesla Stock Tesla is mainly known for its electric vehicles and an outspoken and controversial CEO in the form of Elon Musk. However, the company does much more, including in AI, robotics, and energy generation and storage. It is headquartered in Austin, Texas.\nTesla’s 19% year-to-date (YTD) returns have barely outperformed the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 17.58% returns this year. Considering how important AI and robotics have become, one can expect the stock to continue gaining as more previously deemed impossible achievements become a reality thanks to its increasing investments in those fields.\nTSLA stock trades at an extreme premium when we consider most of the conventional valuation metrics. After gaining 15% in just a month, this valuation has stretched further. Even when compared to its own five-year history, the stock is overvalued. For instance, its forward P/E of 377.87x is 1.5 times higher than its five-year average forward P/E of 148.54x. The forward EV/EBIT ratio is over 3 times the historic average of 115.69x.\n\nThe stock is clearly overvalued. But how do we price in Elon Musk’s statement that people soon may not even need to work because of humanoid robots? How do we cater to Elon Musk’s plan of making car ownership redundant, because one could just call a robotaxi from an app without having to worry about owning a car? The answer to these questions is not simple and depends heavily on how seriously you take Musk's word.\n\nStory Continues\nAs an investor, one needs to decide what risk they are willing to take on. If buying at an all-time high makes you wonder about the downside if the broader market takes a turn for the worse, it's better to stay away. If you are excited about the company’s prospects and lead in AI and robotics, buying below $500 could turn out to be a bargain, especially when the FOMO crowd gets back into the stock once it crosses that psychological level of $500.\n\nTesla Misses Earnings Estimates Tesla announced its Q3 2025 earnings on Oct. 22 and failed to beat earnings estimates. It reported an EPS of $0.5 vs. an estimated EPS of $0.54. It did beat the consensus estimates on revenue, reporting $28.1 billion during the quarter against estimates of $26.37 billion. This was a 12% year-over-year (YoY) increase in revenue. The company’s automotive segment grew at a modest 6%, though.\n\nThe bottom line shrank significantly compared to the same period last year. While lower EV prices were to blame, a major reason was the operating expenses, which have gone up due to AI pursuits and similar R&D projects.\nOn the earnings call, Elon Musk restated the importance of having a decent-sized fleet on the roads, which could be turned into fully autonomous vehicles based on just a software upgrade. He expects that in less than two years, the company could be producing cars at an annualized rate of 3 million.\nTesla also continues to face challenges bringing its humanoid robot Optimus to the market. Issues related to hand dexterity continue to take more resources, but supply chain problems are also adding to the mess. Regulatory hurdles for full self-driving and robotaxis also remain.\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying About TSLA Stock TSLA has always received mixed opinions when it comes to valuation, with analysts sometimes claiming price targets that seem ridiculous. The stock remains a consensus “Hold,” but out of the 40 analysts who cover it on Wall Street, 14 have a “Strong Buy” rating while nine call it a “Strong Sell.” The stock continues to trade around the halfway mark of the mean target price of $389.76 and the highest target price of $600.\nOn the date of publication, Jabran Kundi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Tesla had a rough year in the European Union. Sales of its electric vehicles slumped sharply in the first 11 months, according to European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) data.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTesla sold about 129,000 cars in the EU from January through November, down from roughly 211,000 during the same period in 2024, a drop of around 39%. Meanwhile, overall EV sales across the region continued to grow, making up about 17% of the market.\nChinese automaker BYD ( BYDDF ) has been gaining ground fast. The company sold more than 110,000 cars in the EU so far this year, compared with just over 32,000 in 2024. Cheaper prices and a wider model range are helping BYD attract European buyers.\nAccording to analysts, the drop in Tesla can be attributed to increasing competition from other, more affordable brands and certain reputational risks associated with high-piled politics in Europe by Elon Musk. November sales were also an abrupt drop, and it is unclear how Tesla will be able to recover itself in the form of new models and pricing action in 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

EV sales surged before the deadline, but not surprisingly, Q4 sales are expected to plunge 46% quarter over quarter, per Cox Automotive.\n\nChargePoint ( CHPT ), the largest US charging network with 70,000 ports nationwide (compared to Tesla's 35,000 ports), also saw a bump in installations before the expiration of the tax credit. The big question is what happens next.\n\"We expect to see a bit of a pullback this quarter since so much inventory was moved before it expired,\" ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nHowever, he doesn't think the lull in EV sales and charger installations will last long.\n\"I think people that drive EVs are never going back to gas vehicles. We see all kinds of data where they want to stick with electric vehicles once they've made the switch,\" he said, noting more EV sales will boost charger demand.\nWilmer, a 30-year vet of the Silicon Valley tech scene who was recently named to the Time100 Climate list , believes the combo of new EV products and cheaper prices will determine how big of a headwind the loss of the tax credit will be.\n\n\"You've seen Ford announce their new [Universal EV Platform].

      "Content": "European Union Rolls Back 2035 ICE Ban as EV Demand Softens\n\nLavina Shahu\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: STLA\n\nRNLSY\n\nRNSDF\n\nF\n\nTSLA\n\nThe European Commission recently presented a proposal to roll back the EU’s effective ban on new internal-combustion engine vehicles from 2035, following pressure from the region’s automotive industry. The move represents the bloc’s most significant retreat from its green agenda in recent years.\n\nThe proposal, which still requires approval from EU member states and the European Parliament, would permit the continued sale of certain non-electric vehicles. Automakers in Germany and Italy had lobbied for looser rules. The Commission appears to have responded to industry calls to allow ongoing sales of plug-in hybrids and range-extender vehicles that use fuel, as European carmakers struggle to compete with Tesla and Chinese EV manufacturers.\n\nUnder the plan, the EU would replace the current requirement that all new cars and vans sold from 2035 be zero-emission with a target to cut CO2 emissions by 90% from 2021 levels. Automakers would be required to offset the remaining emissions through measures such as using lower-carbon EU-produced steel, synthetic e-fuels, or non-food biofuels derived from sources like agricultural waste and used cooking oil.\n\nThe proposal also introduces a three-year compliance window from 2030 to 2032 to achieve a 55% reduction in car CO2 emissions versus 2021 levels, while easing the 2030 emissions-reduction target for vans to 40% from 50%.\n\nPer Transport & Environment, the changes could result in up to 25% fewer battery-electric vehicles being sold in 2035 than under the current rules. The group also argues that credits for advanced biofuels and e-fuels would enable carmakers to sell fewer EVs in exchange for emissions reductions that do not materialize. In addition, it warns that advanced biofuels cannot be scaled sustainably and could increase Europe’s dependence on imports of used cooking oil and animal fats, which are often vulnerable to fraud.\n\nAutomakers to Gain From the Recently Presented Proposal Ford ’s F hybrid strategy adds resilience as EV adoption evolves. While the Model e segment faces near-term losses, Ford is positioning for long-term success with its Universal EV Platform, designed for affordable, digitally advanced vehicles starting around $30,000. The company plans to begin equipment installation for UEV production in Louisville and start LFP battery cell production in Michigan later this year, reinforcing its long-term electrification strategy.\n\nF currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 EPS implies year-over-year growth of 34.9%. The consensus mark for F’s 2026 EPS has moved up 3 cents over the past 30 days. The stock has gained 26.8% over the past six months.\n\nStellantis STLA has pulled back from its earlier goal of achieving 100% battery-electric vehicle sales by 2030 and is pivoting toward a more flexible, multi-energy approach. This strategy incorporates hybrids and plug-in hybrids alongside BEVs to better align with evolving consumer demand. As part of this shift, the company is scaling back or postponing some all-electric model launches and temporarily halting production of certain EVs where demand has proven weaker.\n\nSTLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 3.2% and 151.9%, respectively. The stock has gained 11.8% over the past six months.\n\nRenault RNLSY is scaling down investment in EV-related services that have failed to deliver strong returns. The company is withdrawing from some car-sharing activities and significantly slowing the expansion of its EV charging network across Europe to refocus on more profitable core operations. This includes closing services such as Zity in Milan and Madrid, and sharply trimming previously ambitious charging infrastructure plans.\n\nRNLSY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 sales implies year-over-year growth of 20.5%. The consensus mark for RNLSY’s 2025 EPS has moved up 4 cents over the past 90 days.

It also shows the extent to which the company’s strong stock performance this year is based on founder and CEO Elon Musk insisting that Tesla is not a car company but an artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicle, and robotics company.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Tesla Inc.

Sales in China, the world’s largest EV market by far, also signaled trouble. According to Barron’s, “In November, the electric-vehicle maker sold just over 73,000 cars in China, down almost 1% year over year, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung.”\nTesla’s problem in the European Union is worse than it first seems. Registrations for BYD vehicles were up 235.2% to 16,158. For the year, the figure increased by 240% to 110,715. BYD, the world’s largest EV company, is Tesla’s biggest rival. The Chinese company has charged into countries outside its home market.\nTesla’s stock has shaken off the bad news about car sales. It is up 20% this year to about $485. What is more impressive is that its shares traded at $217 in March. This was primarily due to Musk’s involvement with President Trump’s effort to downsize the U.S. government, which eventually led to a falling out between the two. Tesla is the world’s eighth most valuable company, with a market cap of $1.61 trillion.\n\nTesla has begun testing its self-driving robotaxi in Austin and aims to roll out tests in Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. However, it needs to contend with other operators in the same space, led by Alphabet’s Waymo.

It is also the sales leader in its home market of China, which is the world’s largest EV market.\nOne way BYD is pushing into Europe is by building assembly plants there. It is considering a factory in Spain, which would be its third in the region. It has plants operating in Hungary and Turkey. These factories might be a way to avoid tariffs on Chinese EVs in the region.\nBYD’s position in China bolsters its finances. Its market share is about 25%, but there are dozens of competitors, including Tesla. Because the market has so many manufacturers, some are likely to go out of business.\nBYD has started to export its vehicles to markets outside China and Europe. One of its major targets is South America, and it has a factory in Brazil.\n\nFor now, BYD will sell no vehicles in the United States because of a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs. GM and Ford understand that if these tariffs disappear, they will be in trouble.

Regulators said the investigation is happening because of a complaint that the vehicles' mechanical door release, which is supposed to be utilized should the electronic or electrical latches fail, is \"hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive.\"\nTesla uses electronic door buttons instead of regular handles most of the time. Safety experts have been critical of the design for a long time, saying that manual releases, particularly in the back seats, are not clearly marked or easy to see.\nThe examination comes after lawsuits that say passengers in earlier Tesla incidents were stuck because of problems with the door handles. The investigation doesn't automatically lead to a recall, but it's the first stage in a process that might lead to action being taken if safety issues are found.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "CATL Pushes Global Expansion as China EV Growth Slows\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:47 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: CTATF\n\nHNDAF\n\nTSLA\n\nBAMXF\n\nHMC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nCATL's battery manufacturing scale continues to stand out as global EV demand evolves. At its flagship facility in Ningde, the company operates a largely automated production line capable of producing up to 60 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion batteries annually, a volume described as sufficient to power roughly 1 million Model Ys for Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). According to SNE Research, more than one in three electric vehicles produced this year used CATL batteries, including models from BMW, Ford ( NYSE:F ), Honda ( NYSE:HMC ), Mercedes and Tesla, as well as Chinese brands such as Xiaomi ( XIACY ). This scale has translated into financial and market influence, highlighted by CATL's $5.3 billion Hong Kong share sale in May and founder Yuqun Robin Zeng's estimated $58.3 billion net worth on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with HMC.\nIs HMC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAt the same time, CATL is facing signs of maturing demand in its core market. China's EV sector, where over 50% of new passenger cars sold are now fully electric or plug-in hybrids, is expected by BloombergNEF to move toward a surplus of battery manufacturing capacity, a development that could weigh on pricing. In response, CATL is accelerating overseas expansion, particularly in Europe and Southeast Asia, while navigating rising political scrutiny of Chinese battery suppliers. Its first overseas factory in Germany was designed for roughly 14 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity, though production has ramped more slowly than planned amid higher operating costs, staffing challenges, and cultural differences. People familiar with the situation say some automakers have requested a blend of imported and locally produced batteries to manage costs, leaving a large share of CATL batteries used in European-built EVs still sourced from China.\n\nLooking ahead, CATL is positioning new investments as potential growth drivers while accepting near-term complexity. The company is preparing to start production at its Debrecen, Hungary facility, a 7 billion project intended to supply BMW and Mercedes-Benz Group, with management outlining a phased ramp from 30 to 40 gigawatt-hours and a longer-term target exceeding 100 gigawatt-hours. In China, CATL is testing battery-swapping through its Choco-Swap program, which relies on subscription pricing and a planned rollout of 1,000 swap stations, though management has acknowledged technical and financial risks. In the US, policy headwinds remain, including restrictions on government contracts, yet commercial links persist: Ford is licensing CATL technology for stationary energy storage systems produced domestically, and Tesla is building lithium-iron-phosphate production lines in Nevada using CATL technology. General Motors' August decision to source made-in-China CATL batteries for its most affordable US EVs following the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit suggests cost pressures could continue to shape sourcing decisions, even as geopolitical risks remain elevated.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The billionaire ended the post by saying that \"money won't matter.\"\nTrump Accounts Compliance Woes The comments come amid concerns expressed by experts for parents opting to enroll in the initiative, warning that a hidden fine print for the initiative would lead to a tax filing only reserved for the ultra-wealthy. Experts warn that the contributions made by parents after the initial seed capital from the federal government lack a crucial exemption from federal gift tax laws.\n\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nMeanwhile, Michael Dell , founder of Dell Technologies Inc.

The firm reduced its Q4 delivery outlook for Tesla to 427,000 from 470,000, citing a sharper than anticipated deterioration in demand, with weakness broad-based across products and regions. However, even with the Q4 estimate cut, Canaccord sees “constructive developments beneath the surface” for Tesla. The recent share rally shows the market is looking through Q4, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes the end of U.S. electric vehicle subsidies, while a near-term drag on demand, is “forcing a healthier, more durable market to emerge.” Tesla “still stands alone in the U.S. with a truly scaled, integrated EV franchise,” according to Canaccord. Meanwhile, the analyst believes electric vehicle adoption is “rising quickly” in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil. Tesla’s robotaxi rollout is progressing, the firm adds. Canaccord says the company’s underlying positives outweigh the near-term earnings reset.\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge-fund level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.
