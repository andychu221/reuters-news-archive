      "Content": "Tesla feels pressure from BYD in EV sales race\n\nTobi Opeyemi Amure\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:37 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: BYDDF\n\nTSLA\n\nBYD said its sales of battery‑powered cars surged almost 28% in 2025 to more than 2.25 million, firmly outpacing Tesla’s projected 1.6–1.65 million deliveries for the year. CNBC reported that BYD disclosed 2.26 million battery‑electric sales, while analyst estimates compiled by the network suggested Tesla’s total would come in roughly 8% lower than a year earlier, extending a 2024 slump.\n\nThe scale of the shift is striking. Company filings and aggregated data cited by outlets such as Ground News indicate that BYD sold about 2.26 million EVs in 2025, versus roughly 1.64 million for Tesla, giving the Chinese group close to a 600,000‑unit edge.\nThe BBC framed the milestone as the first time BYD has “outpaced its American rival for annual sales,” underscoring how quickly China’s domestic champion has gone from being mocked by Elon Musk to topping global league tables.\nA turning point for Tesla Tesla’s weaker year is a critical part of the story. Investing.com and Yahoo Finance coverage highlight that Tesla’s 2025 deliveries was around 1.64 million (down approximately 8% from 2024), marking the company’s second consecutive annual decline.\nIn the fourth quarter alone, Tesla’s deliveries fell roughly 16% year over year to about 416,000 vehicles, compared with 495,570 in the same period of 2024, despite months of price cuts and discounts.\n\nThose numbers suggest more than just a one‑off stumble.\nAnalysts quoted across North American outlets such as CNBC say Tesla faces a “more normalized demand environment,” where early‑adopter enthusiasm has cooled, and competition has intensified, particularly in China and Europe. CNBC’s EV coverage has also underscored how subsidies have been scaled back in some key markets, making it harder for premium‑priced brands to grow volumes without sacrificing margins.\nFor a company that built its valuation on unit growth and software‑like operating leverage, two straight years of shrinking deliveries reset investor expectations.\nHow BYD built its lead BYD’s ascent reflects both strategy and structure. The company not only sells more pure EVs than Tesla but also dominates China’s broader “new energy vehicle” segment once plug‑in hybrids are included, with total NEV sales around 4.6 million in 2025 according to figures cited by CNBC .\nThat breadth lets BYD participate in lower price bands that Tesla largely ignores, particularly in its home market where compact models such as the Seagull and Dolphin appeal to first‑time EV buyers.\n\nVertical integration is another pillar of BYD’s advantage. Nikkei Asia has noted that BYD’s in‑house battery operations and its blade‑battery platform help it manage costs and rollout speed, especially as it ramps exports. BYD’s chairman Wang Chuanfu has argued that the company has “established itself as a frontrunner across all sectors, including batteries, electronics, and new energy vehicles,” a claim backed by 2024 revenue of 777 billion yuan (about $107 billion), which already exceeded Tesla’s sales that year.\n\nStory Continues\nGeography matters as well. Reporting from the BBC , Yahoo Finance , and others shows that BYD has pushed aggressively into Latin America, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, even as many countries impose higher tariffs on Chinese EVs.\nIn October, BYD said the United Kingdom had become its largest market outside China, with sales in Britain soaring 880% in the year to the end of September on strong demand for the Seal U plug‑in hybrid SUV. That kind of diversified growth helps offset pressure from price wars in China and policy risks in any single region.\n\nBYD and Tesla 2025 EV metrics 2025 BEV sales : 2.25–2.26 million (+28%) for BYD and 1.6-1.65 million (‑8%) for Tesla\n2025 total NEV / EV sales : 4.6 million (incl. PHEVs) for BYD and 1.64 million (all EVs) for Tesla\nLargest market outside home country: UK, +880% YoY for BYD and U.S. for Tesla\nFigures compiled from CNBC , BBC , and Ground News .\n\nGlobal implications and policy risks BYD’s new status as the top EV seller lands in a market that is no longer purely about hyper‑growth. European regulators have opened an anti‑subsidy probe into Chinese EV imports, and CNBC has reported that BYD has already beaten Tesla in European BEV sales in some recent periods despite higher tariffs, a “watershed moment” for the continent’s auto industry.\nThat success is forcing traditional European automakers to respond on price and product, while also giving policymakers a tangible example of how Chinese industrial policy can reshape a strategic sector.\nNorth American policy is equally pivotal. Ground News notes that the expiration of a key U.S. EV tax credit and rising political backlash against Elon Musk contributed to slower Tesla deliveries, especially for mass‑market vehicles that are more sensitive to upfront pricing.\nAt the same time, new U.S. tariffs and proposed restrictions on Chinese EVs have effectively kept BYD out of the American passenger car market so far, concentrating its overseas push in Europe, Latin America, and Asia instead. That geographic asymmetry means the global EV race is being fought on unequal regulatory terrain.\n\nMore Automotive:\nTesla investors may miss game-changing move\nKey auto parts and services company files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nTop-rated analyst drops curt 8-word take on Tesla stock\nU.S. car maker wins 2025 sales race with 2.8 million vehicles sold\nFord turns a setback into a win\nFrom Asia’s vantage point, BYD’s rise is already being treated as a structural power shift. Nikkei Asia has described the Chinese automaker as “on track to surpass its American competitor Tesla in worldwide electric vehicle sales,” stressing how quickly it has leveraged domestic scale into global presence.\nRelated: Tesla Cybertruck owners are going to hate Tesla's latest move\nWhat’s next for the world’s top EV seller For Tesla, losing the top‑seller title intensifies pressure to deliver on its next wave of innovation. It can be argued that advances in autonomous driving and a genuinely lower‑cost next‑gen vehicle platform are critical if Tesla is going to reaccelerate growth and defend margins in a more crowded field.\n\nWithout a step‑change product that can move the volume needle, the company risks looking like a mature automaker with a tech multiple.\nFor BYD, the challenge is different. The company has to prove that it can sustain growth and profitability while navigating tariffs and political scrutiny in Europe and other developed markets. Ground News reporting suggests BYD is targeting about 1.6 million overseas sales in 2026 while analysts model around 1.8 million for Tesla, which would make the race far closer outside China even if BYD maintains an overall lead.\nExecution on new factories and on brand‑building in Europe and the Americas will determine whether BYD becomes a lasting global heavyweight or primarily a Chinese powerhouse with strong export pockets.\n\nEither way, the numbers from 2025 mark a clear inflection point. BYD now sells more pure electric cars than Tesla, its revenue has already surpassed its American rival, and its footprint stretches from Guangzhou to Glasgow. For investors, policymakers, and competitors, the message is simple: the center of gravity in the EV world has moved, and catching up to China’s new champion will require more than just a fresh model or a one‑off price cut.\nRelated: Tesla investors may miss game-changing move\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 2, 2026, where it first appeared in the Automotive section.

He predicted that this would lead to an influx of illegal immigration and fraud, which would fundamentally change the country.\nDon't Miss:\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n“America is toast if the radical left wins. They will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and fraud. Won't be America anymore,” the Tesla CEO wrote.\nMusk’s post was a response to another post talking about reports doing the rounds that he is financially backing the GOP for President Donald Trump to “take back” complete control of the House in the upcoming midterm elections. In mid-December, Axios had revealed that the billionaire had started funding Republican House and Senate campaigns, making significant contributions and signaling plans to provide more throughout the election cycle.\n\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nMusk's GOP Donations Stir Political Waves In 2024, Elon Musk donated nearly a staggering $277 million to support then-presidential candidate Trump as well as other Republican candidates. This made him the largest financial supporter of the 2024 elections. Once back at the White House, Trump entrusted Musk with a major responsibility to cut government fraud and wastage through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nSurprisingly, Musk’s donations continued in 2025, when he contributed $15 million to Trump’s MAGA Inc. and the GOP, just three days before he called for the formation of a third party amid his infamous fallout with the president.\nIn recent times, Trump and Musk have ironed out their differences, though.\nMeanwhile, Musk has always been critical of the Democrats for backing illegal immigrants, whom he accused of being involved in several government frauds. Recently, he pointed to the election of Rep. Ilhan Omar in Minnesota and the Somali community as an example of this. Musk warned that the trend of “importing voters” is a threat to American democracy.\n\nStory Continues\nRead Next:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\nImage via Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

The Dow rose two-thirds of one percent while the S&P 500 added two tenths, and the Nasdaq was little changed. Gains in chipmakers like Nvidia were offset by losses in Tesla. The electric car maker’s shares fell about two and a half percent after it posted its second straight year of declining sales in 2025. Last year, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all notched double-digit gains, their third straight year in the green, a run last seen during 2019-2021. Technology stocks boosted the Nasdaq more than 20% and Alex Guiliano, chief investment strategist with Resonate Wealth Partners, says that has made them expensive and investors should look to other sectors for opportunities. “Valuations in different corners of the market, whether it's value or international stock opportunities, can complement quite nicely some of the trends we've seen with the AI narrative. And if you're concerned about where the AI narrative has taken you, especially with valuations being where they are, you don't necessarily have to chase that with new money or the dividends that you're reinvesting. It's a great opportunity to look at other corners of the market.” Another stock on the move today was Ulta Beauty which added two and a half percent after broker Argus Research increased its price target. It says the retailer continues to grow despite a softer industry backdrop as the company gains market share through innovation and exclusive product launches.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla Deliveries Plummet: What You Need to Know\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 3:29 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Following a record third quarter, Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries dropped sharply in Q4 -- both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially.\nGiven this sales decline, investors will likely be watching the company's full-year guidance closely when Tesla reports its fourth-quarter financial results later this month.\nEnergy storage deployments kept climbing even as vehicle volumes slid.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported its fourth-quarter 2025 vehicle deliveries this morning, and the headline number moved in the wrong direction. While a drop in vehicle deliveries was expected, it's still disappointing in the broader context of the growth stock 's exceptionally high valuation . For a company whose shares are priced for extreme growth, a down quarter is never comfortable.\nOf course, deliveries are only part of the story for the electric vehicle company. Investors won't see fourth-quarter revenue and profit until Tesla publishes its full quarterly update on Jan. 28. In the meantime, however, this is the freshest data Tesla investors have -- and it's not looking good.\nHere's a closer look at Tesla's latest delivery numbers, and why this sales slump may not last.\nThe magnitude of the drop Tesla delivered 418,227 vehicles in the fourth quarter, down 15.6% from 495,570 in the same quarter of 2024.\n\nDeliveries are disappointing on an annual basis as well. The company finished 2025 with about 1.64 million deliveries, an 8.6% decline from 2024's 1.79 million.\nPerhaps even more concerning, Tesla's fourth-quarter production slipped both sequentially and year over year. During Q4, Tesla produced 434,358 vehicles, down from 459,445 a year earlier and 447,450 in Q3.\n\nProduction also exceeded deliveries by about 16,000 vehicles in the quarter. But this gap may be because the company is trying to normalize inventory levels after delivering significantly more vehicles than it produced in Q3.\n\nWhat's going on with Tesla's deliveries? The recent rhythm has been choppy. Tesla's Q2 deliveries were down 13.5% year over year. Then third-quarter deliveries rose 7.4%. Finally, fourth-quarter deliveries then fell both year over year and sequentially.\nThe main cause of this recent sales volatility was a combination of generally weaker demand for autos and the timing of the expiration of the Federal U.S. clean-vehicle tax credit. Expiring after Sept. 30, 2025, there was an incentive for buyers to pull purchases forward into the third quarter. This is why lower fourth-quarter deliveries were expected.\n\nStory Continues\nOf course, Tesla's delivery release did include one bright spot. The company's energy storage deployments reached 14.2 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the fourth quarter, surpassing the prior record of 12.5 GWh set in the third quarter. Full-year storage deployments were 46.7 GWh, up from 31.4 GWh in 2024.\n\nWhile this is a smaller part of Tesla's overall business, it has been growing as a percent of its operations over time. So, it's good to see continued rapid growth in this nascent yet important segment.\nThe bigger story While it would obviously be better to see vehicle sales rising than declining, Tesla investors seem to be focusing more on factors beyond short-term sales trends these days. Given the stock's market capitalization of nearly $1.5 trillion as of this writing and the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of more than 300, investors are betting on major catalysts to both add a new revenue stream for the company and accelerate demand for its vehicles.\n\nThe catalysts? The advent of self-driving capabilities and Robotaxi, Tesla's autonomous ride-sharing service. Unlike Uber 's ride-sharing app, Tesla's is built around its own fleet of vehicles. The company believes that future software updates will eventually make all of the vehicles it sells capable of driving themselves and of being deployed into Tesla's Robotaxi operation.\nIn addition to Robotaxi providing a future revenue stream for the company, Tesla thinks it will lead to an influx in demand for its vehicles. Indeed, in the company's most recent earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he is planning to increase production as fast as possible because he is confident that the realization of full self-driving capabilities in its cars will lead to increased demand.\n\nWith all of this in mind, investors will be watching Tesla's fourth-quarter update closely later this month to see if Musk thinks these catalysts will finally arrive this year. Without the full realization of self-driving technology and the scaling of Robotaxi from a pilot program to a fully commercialized ride-sharing business, investors may start focusing more on Tesla's underwhelming near-term sales, and the stock could slide.\nWe just issued 'double down' alerts on 3 stocks — find out if Tesla made our list Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.19%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.66%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.03%.\nShares of the electric car maker witnessed a loss of 1.06% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector with its gain of 3.98%, and the S&P 500's gain of 0.54%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Tesla in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $0.46, signifying a 36.99% drop compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $24.76 billion, down 3.7% from the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.63 per share and revenue of $94.76 billion, which would represent changes of -32.64% and 0%, respectively, from the prior year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 4.79% lower. At present, Tesla boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nLooking at valuation, Tesla is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 194.33. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 12.73 of its industry.\n\nWe can also see that TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 5.55. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Automotive - Domestic industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.92.\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 96, which puts it in the top 40% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

On Wednesday, John Freeman , Co-Founder and Senior Analyst at Ravenswood Partners, highlighted the potential impact of Microsoft’s Azure on Google’s AI business, particularly in the context of the upcoming ChatGPT 6 and the Gemini 3. Johnson pointed out that Google’s traditional business model, which relies on providing links instead of giving direct answers, has been impacted by ChatGPT, and this shift could potentially cut into Google’s revenues.\n“Anything on the margin that clips it, I think would really…hurt the stock,” he stated.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nMissed Tesla?

He added that Microsoft’s Azure is not only the leading AI cloud provider but also has a strong influence on the developer community, which further strengthens its position in the AI market.\n\n“And you don’t have the downside risk of generative AI disruption. I mean, you’ve got Microsoft 365 and Windows. Those are not likely to be disrupted by AI anytime soon,” he added.\nCorey Johnson , chief market strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research , echoed Freeman’s opinion on Google and stated that what Google is doing with AI erodes the core offerings of its business of generating revenue through clicks.\n“Their business is at inherent risk because of the cannibalization of AI,” he stated.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAnalysts Divided Over Google’s Prospects The analysts’ observations align with recent developments in the AI space.

Trading volume reached 84.6 million shares, coming in roughly 2.4% above its three-month average of 82.5 million shares.\n\nFriday’s action followed fresh Q4 delivery data and ongoing debate over Tesla's pivot toward autonomy and energy, and investors are watching how quickly new AI and robotaxi efforts can scale.\n\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) added 0.19% to close at 6,859, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) slipped 0.03% to finish at 23,236. Automotive industry peers Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) rose 1.68% and General Motors (NYSE:GM) fell 0.42%, as legacy automakers' EV growth and GM's strong 2025 stock performance highlighted intensifying competitive pressure.\n\nWhat this means for investors Tesla reported Q4 deliveries were 418,227, a drop of nearly 16% versus the prior-year period. 2025 full-year deliveries declined 8.5%. However, there was also good news in Tesla's update. Deployment of energy storage products rose to a record 14.2 gigawatt hours (GWh). Deployments in Tesla's fast-growing energy segment soared nearly 50% year over year.\n\nInvestors seem to be focusing on the company's energy segment, along with its expanding autonomous vehicle and humanoid robot technologies. Those are the areas CEO Elon Musk has been pushing for investors to make their primary focus.\nInvestors will hear more on Jan. 28 when the company reports its full fourth-quarter financial results and provides updates on progress with robotaxis and robots.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Tesla loses EV crown to China's BYD in 2025 as sales slip\n\nBeiyi SEOW\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 1:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\nTesla's sales fell in 2025, the company reported Friday, ceding its position as the world's biggest electric vehicle maker for the year to Chinese auto giant BYD.\nThe American company led by Elon Musk logged 418,227 deliveries in the final three months of the year, taking its full-year sales figure to around 1.64 million EVs.\n\nThis marked a drop in sales of more than eight percent compared with 2024.\nA day prior, BYD said that it sold 2.26 million EVs last year.\nAnalysts had expected Tesla's sales in the final quarter to slow less, to 449,000, according to a FactSet consensus.\nThe pullback comes amid the elimination of a $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025, with industry watchers noting it will take time for EV demand to rebalance.\nBut even before then, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of US President Donald Trump and other far-right politicians.\nTesla has also been grappling with rising competition from BYD and other Chinese companies, and from European giants.\nShenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid cars, unveiled record EV sales in the past year on Thursday.\n\nKnown as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese -- or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" -- BYD was founded in 1995 and originally specialized in battery manufacturing.\nThe automotive juggernaut has come to dominate China's highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term used to describe various vehicles from fully electric ones to plug-in hybrids. China is the world's largest market for new energy vehicles.\nBYD is now looking to expand its presence overseas, as increasingly price-wary consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability.\nWhile BYD and other Chinese EV producers come up against hefty tariffs in the United States, the company's success is picking up in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and in Europe.\n\nTesla only narrowly beat BYD in annual EV sales in 2024, with the US company's 1.79 million outpacing the latter's 1.76 million.\nTesla shares closed 2.6 percent down in New York on Friday.\nAnalysts at Wedbush Securities noted that Tesla's quarterly sales figure remained better than some had speculated.\nThey flagged that the company faces a \"more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"\nThe company still sees challenges obtaining certain regulatory approval in Europe -- relating to self-driving technology -- with sales potentially rebounding once the regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nStory Continues\n\"Sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe,\" Wedbush analysts said.\nbys/aha\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The benchmark S&P 500 rose over 16% for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite led gains with a more-than 20% jump.\n\nNow the focus turns to 2026, though the year will likely begin in earnest come Monday. For stocks, the outlook calls for more optimism. Every Wall Street forecaster tracked by Bloomberg is predicting that stocks will rally for a fourth consecutive year . But plenty of risks remain: The AI boom could falter, the US economy could surprise, and President Trump, of course, remains a wild card as the fate of his most sweeping tariffs could become clearer this month.\nGold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) advanced to open the 2026 trading year, with the precious metals building on their best annual performances since 1979, and aluminum ( ALI=F ) crossed $3,000 per ton for the first time since 2022.\n\nWall Street's bid for a \"Santa Claus rally\" — during the last five trading days of December and first two of January — has so far sputtered. The S&P 500 is down nearly 1% in the period, with investors looking at a third consecutive down \"Santa\" period.\nAmong the top items on Wall Street's 2026 list is the Federal Reserve, where the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 look likely to continue this year. President Trump has promised this month to appoint a new chair to replace Jerome Powell. For now, most traders expect the central bank to hold steady on interest rates later this month, though bets are more split for March's meeting.\nLIVE 19 updates\n11 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nDow, S&P 500 kick off the first day of trading with gains Stocks kicked off the first day of trading with modest gains as semiconductor stocks lifted the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nThe broad-based index gained nearl 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose 0.6%.

      "Content": "Why Palantir Fell Hard To Start 2026\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 11:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Palantir sold off with the software sector, which appeared to suffer from a rotation into chip stocks.\nInvestors may also be taking profits on the first trading day of the year to delay capital gains taxes after Palantir's monster 2025.\nNegative news for Tesla also may be affecting Palantir's price action at the edges today.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nShares of AI software giant Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) plunged on Friday, falling 5.9% as of 1:41 PM EDT.\nThere wasn't any company-specific news for Palantir today, but a combination of related factors led to the stock's big slump to start the new year.\nSoftware rotation, profit-taking, and Elon Musk may be culprits The overall software sector fell on Friday, so Palantir certainly wasn't alone in its decline. The across-the-board declines in software stocks , combined with an unusually strong day for semiconductor stocks , point to a big rotation among technology investors today.\nIn addition to that apparent rotation, Palantir may also be seeing a round of profit-taking on the first trading day of the new year. The stock was up 138% in 2025, as the company delivered a series of earnings reports that consistently exceeded expectations, with quarterly growth accelerating between 40% and 60% every quarter.\n\nInvestors may have been waiting to sell the stock until the new year in order to defer capital gains tax payments until April of 2027. So, that mere technical factor could be playing a part in the sell-off today.\nMeanwhile, Palantir may be suffering somewhat from its association with Elon Musk. Musk and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel are close friends, dating back to their days as early founders of PayPal .\nElon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported fourth quarter deliveries of 418,227 vehicles today, which was well short of the 440,907 vehicle count that Wall Street investors had estimated for the quarter. The miss brought Tesla's vehicle deliveries to a second straight year of declines.\nWhile there isn't really any tangible connection between Palantir and Tesla, the two stocks may be linked for some investors, who may group all of the \"PayPal Mafia\" stocks associated with Musk and Thiel together in the same group of stocks.\nWhere will Palantir go after a blockbuster 2025? After its monster year last year, Palantir's stock still looks quite frothy at 390 times trailing earnings, even after today's decline.\nBut the seemingly insane valuation might not be as crazy as it seems if Palantir can continue to deliver the blockbuster growth it did in 2025, as the company became the go-to platform for harnessing generative AI into tangible business outcomes. Only time will tell if the AI revolution can continue propelling Palantir to new heights, or if the company's growth will inevitably stall out.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?

( TSLA , Financials ) delivered 418,227 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2025 , which was less than the 423,000 that analysts had expected. This was a 16% reduction from the previous year. The total number of units delivered for the whole year was 1,636,129.The drop comes after a big rise in the first half of the year, when people hurried to take advantage of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit, which ended at the end of September. Demand dropped a lot in the fourth quarter, even as manufacturing remained and reached 434,358 cars for the quarter.The Model 3 and Model Y lines made up most of the deliveries in Q4, with over 406,000 units. Investors are worried about demand patterns and margin pressure as Tesla's inventory builds up going into 2026.On January 28, the firm will announce its fourth quarter profits. Investors will want to know about changes in pricing strategy, inventory levels, and production plans.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla loses EV crown to BYD as demand dips, credits expire\n\nReuters Videos\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 10:38 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\nSTORY: Tesla lost its crown as the top electric vehicle seller in 2025. China’s BYD passed Tesla, which saw sales fall for the second straight year. Tesla is dealing with intensifying competition, the expiration of U.S. tax credits and damage to the automaker's brand due to CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric. While BYD is benefiting from rapid growth in Europe where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the U.S. rival. Sales for the full year dropped more than 8%, slightly steeper than analysts polled by Visible Alpha predicted. While sales in the fourth quarter slid more than 15% which was wider than analysts anticipated as well. BYD said sales outside of China climbed about 150% from 2024. On a global basis, EV sales rose 28% last year. Tesla shares fell more than one percent in morning trading. One analyst tells Reuters he thinks investors are focused on the company's future in robotaxis and humanoid robots and ignoring delivery numbers. Tesla in October launched stripped-down \"Standard\" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models to try to entice car buyers. The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product. Even as vehicle deliveries have weakened, Tesla shares rose about 11.4% in 2025, boosting Musk's wealth.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Elon Musk keeps getting richer as Tesla loses EV lead\n\nQuartz\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:54 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\nTesla's annual sales have dropped for the second year in a row, the company said Friday.\nThe Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker delivered 1.64 million cars last year, a 9% fall from the 1.79 million it shipped in 2024. It delivered 418,227 vehicles in the final quarter of 2025, down 16% year-over-year and missing analyst expectations for 441,000 vehicles, according to an average compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nOn Monday, Tesla took the unusual step of publishing a consensus estimate, which predicted the automaker would deliver 422,850 vehicles in Q4.\nThe results snatch Tesla's crown as the world’s biggest electric-vehicle maker, overtaken by Chinese rival BYD.\nBYD said on Thursday that it sold 2.26 million battery-electric vehicles in 2025, up 28% from a year ago, following its expansion in Europe and other overseas markets. The automaker had previously outsold Tesla on a quarterly basis, but Friday’s results mean it has now overtaken Tesla for annual EV deliveries.\nTesla had a bumpy ride in 2025. The company's share price fell 21.3% in the first half of the year due to a number of headwinds, including Musk's alienating political rhetoric, fiercer competition from Chinese and legacy U.S. automakers, and concerns among investors that the CEO's role heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would cause him to neglect his businesses.\n\nTesla was also stung by federal EV tax credits — $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used — expiring on Sept. 30, 2025. Tesla’s November U.S. sales fell nearly 23% year over year to 39,800 vehicles, according to Cox Automotive data, even after Tesla rolled out cheaper ( but still not that cheap ) “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3.\nHowever, Tesla's stock price has had a renaissance in recent weeks, hitting an all-time closing high of $489.88 in December. The rally came after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board for the first time, almost six months after launching a pilot with safety drivers.\nTesla's second consecutive annual drop in sales came as its board reinstated Musk as the highest-paid CEO in history, with a new pay package of 96 million restricted shares worth $29 billion. His original 2018 moonshot mega-grant had been tied up in Delaware courts for seven years after a judge twice rescinded the package.\n\nDuring litigation, Tesla moved to Texas from Delaware, and the board adopted a rule requiring any investor who wants to challenge Musk’s pay to hold 3% of the company's stock. The amount is equivalent to roughly $44 billion at current market price, helping to shield Musk against repeat challenges to his pay plan.\n\nStory Continues\nOn top of this, Tesla's shareholders voted in November to approve the largest remuneration package in history that could see Musk pocket as much as $1 trillion in stock over the next decade, although required payments would reduce this to a modest $878 billion.\nSo, despite Tesla's enduring slump, Musk defended his title as world's richest person last year, driven by Tesla pay packages and the soaring valuation of his rocket and satellite company SpaceX. Musk's fortunes approached an estimated $623 billion in 2025 , up by more than $190 billion.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Here's how much the world's richest people made in 2025\n\nQuartz\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:03 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIt was a record-breaking year for the world's richest people.\nIn 2025, the world’s 500 wealthiest individuals saw their fortunes balloon by an unprecedented $2.2 trillion, driving their combined net worth to nearly $12 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nThis surge was fueled by robust gains across stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities, buoyed by President Donald Trump unleashing a free-market-blitz, cutting corporate taxes and loosening regulations.\n\nTo no surprise, Big Tech dominated the index , as a stock market frenzy for artificial intelligence saw market caps surge.\nAbout a quarter of the index's gains came from just eight people, with all but one in tech. This includes Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Alphabet co-founder Larry Page, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\nAlthough, that's down from last year, when the same eight billionaires accounted for 43% of the total gains.\nMusk continued to top the list. Even as Tesla stock oscillated amid supply chain concerns, Musk's waning popularity, and competition from Chinese electric vehicle makers, his fortunes grew to nearly $623 billion, up by more than $190 billion.\nBut Ellison briefly eclipsed Musk as the world's richest man in September, due to a sudden surge in Oracle's share price, rallying around 25% for the entire month, as the cloud infrastructure company unveiled a $300 billion contract with OpenAI and ramped up AI spending. Yet, since then, broader tech market corrections and concerns about Oracle's rising debt have tempered those gains, with its stock down about 40% since.\n\nTrump and his family saw their net worth reach $6.8 billion, up $282 million in a year, according to the index. Trump’s business ventures span real estate, social media, and financial services, with many explicitly capitalizing on his political following. Just three days before his inauguration, Trump launched the meme coin $TRUMP, and soon offered its top holders a private dinner with him. The president has been widely criticized for the coin, which had added more than $200 million to the family's wealth, according to the index. Columbia Law’s Richard Briffault called it “doubly corrupt,” as Trump simultaneously oversees the cryptocurrency industry’s deregulation.\nWhile U.S. equities posted strong returns, international markets outshone them. The S&P 500 Index posted an annual increase of 17%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng saw gain of 22% and 27%, respectively.\nBut it was a blockbuster year for precious metals, posting one of their best years in decades, as investors poured into safe haven assets like gold and silver. Copper and rare earths, key materials for producing the batteries and electrical wires needed to power green energy, were also in high demand. Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart and Chile’s Luksic family saw their fortunes balloon by billions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meanwhile, the American automaker's final quarterly earning report showed its annual sales fell for a second straight year. Tesla deliveries declined to 1.64 million, down from 1.79 million in 2024.\n\nIntensifying competition, the expiration of $7,500 federal tax credits for EV buyers and consumer backlash tied to Musk becoming the face of the Department of Government Efficiency made 2025 a challenging year for Tesla.\nStill, Tesla shares rose about 11.4% in 2025, boosting Musk's wealth . After Tesla published its final quarterly earnings report Jan. 2, its shares had dipped 1.2% by the afternoon, while BYD's shares had jumped about 5%.\nContributing: Reuters\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: China's BYD overtakes Tesla as largest electric vehicle seller\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Jan. 2: Tesla Disappoints On Deliveries; Markets Look Up To Start 2026\n\nNoah Weidner\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ^IXIC\n\nTSLA\n\nThis live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market. To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here .\nHappy Friday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Jan. 2, 2025. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nUpdate: 9:30 a.m. ET Opening Bell The first opening bell of 2026 is ringing. The Nasdaq (+1.11%) is up more than one percent, while the Russell 2000 (+0.52%) and S&P 500 (+0.47%) are also advancing. The Dow (-0.04%), meanwhile, appears to be falling into decline -- nearing that center line on the chart as of this writing.\nYou can quickly identify why the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are doing so well this morning. One word: technology. Check out the heat map -- or rather, the green map. It's Mag7 or bust to start 2026...\nHowever, it doesn't just stop at the Mag7. Zoom out and you'll see that the Russell 2000 and its growth-centric crowd has an affinity for tech stocks, too. However, they're also bidding up industrials, materials, and pockets of other sectors. Here's how that looks right now:\nWe'll add some more context here once the market starts moving and shaking. Check back soon!\nUpdate: 9:06 a.m. ET Tesla Falls Short of Delivery Expectations Electric vehicle firm Tesla fell far short of analyst expectations in its latest quarterly report, coming in at 418,227 deliveries. Analysts were looking for a number closer to 440,907.\nThe tepid showing comes after the Trump administration and Congress moved to retire a federal EV credit, setting off a boom in sales before its expiration at the end of the third quarter, which made the fourth quarter the first full quarter of sales without the credit to help move its inventory.\n\nHow this will ultimately boil down to the company's earnings remains to be seen. However, some transitory pain is expected. The company has looked to pivot from its roots as an energy firm to an autonomy company, embracing the promise of its Robotaxi business and Optimus humanoid robot.\nThose businesses are unlikely to contribute much to the company's coming quarterly report, expected later this month, but the report might offer commentary on the progress of key programs.\nUpdate: 8:27 a.m. ET A.M. Update Happy 2026. It's the first trading day of the year, which means fresh beginnings for the markets. Analysts have stacked expectations for this year, with market hawks widely expecting another year of returns -- many polled by TheStreet are even banking on a fourth consecutive double-digit showing this year.\n\nStory Continues\nFor many versed in the here and now, the end of the fourth quarter will also herald the first major test of 2026: bank earnings. We'll get those lined up next week, but in the meantime, the bulls seem to be warming up. This morning, futures for the the Nasdaq (+0.97%) are up nearly one percent, while the Russell 2000 (+0.64%), S&P 500 (+0.55%), Dow (+0.36%) are also tipped to the upside for the first trading session of 2026.\n\nEconomic Data + Events This morning, we'll get our first data point of 2026 in the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for December. It's out at 9:45 a.m. PT. Last month, it came in at 52.2.\nAside from that, we'll get the Fed Balance Sheet for the last week of 2026 at some point later in the day. Then, we'll call it a wraps for the first trading day of 2026.\n\nIn business data, Tesla 's latest delivery data will also be carefully scrutinized; it's due out before the market open and we'll do an update once that comes out.\nNext week, we'll get the big boys as ISM Manufacturing and Services, JOLTS Job Openings, and Payrolls are slated to report.\nEarnings Today There are no earnings today.

      "Content": "Tesla annual sales decline 9% as it’s overtaken by BYD as global EV leader\n\nKirsten Korosec\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:17 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\nTesla annual sales have fallen for the second year in a row, a drop fueled by the removal of the federal tax credit in the U.S. and competition from Chinese automakers.\nTesla delivered 1.63 million vehicles globally in 2025, a 9% fall from 1.79 million in 2024, according to figures released by the company . Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered “other models,” a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S.\n\nTesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday.\nTesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China’s BYD, which delivered 2.26 million EVs in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States — although notably not from Chinese automakers which are barred from selling vehicles in the country.\nBut it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a record-breaking 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter — a 29% increase from previous quarter — as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers.\n\nTesla’s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and towards AI and robotics. Musk’s pitch is there is money to be made in “sustainable abundance,” a catchphrase used throughout the company’s recent Master Plan IV that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage and robotics.\nAnd yet, the bulk of Tesla’s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

By contrast, Tesla announced Friday that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles during the same period, representing an 8% decline from 2024 and marking the company’s second consecutive annual drop.\n\nTesla’s fourth-quarter 2025 deliveries fell approximately 16% compared to the same period in 2024, when the company reported 495,570 deliveries.\nThis milestone represents a remarkable rise for BYD, a company that Tesla CEO Elon Musk once dismissed during a Bloomberg TV interview in October 2011.

With the decline, Tesla lost its title as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker.\nThe company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.\n\nChina's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.\nTesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May to refocus on Tesla.\nAt the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.\nDespite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.\n\nAlthough Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses — its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service — can serve as growth engines.\n\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.\nHe added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"\nShares of Tesla rose $4.16, or 0.9%, to $453.88 in early trading Friday.\nCheaper Tesla models\n\nThe latest quarter was the first reporting period that includes sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3, which Tesla unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD — known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" — now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.\nWhile BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.\nTrump now says he had CT scan, not MRI in October\nSeveral killed in Iran amid protests over economic crisis\nTony Dokoupil: Don't just trust me.

Edgar Gao of Sublime China Information Co.'s Fubao department said the move can be viewed as a policy boost for recyclers and could offer some benefit to customers importing directly from Europe and the US, although the advantage may be limited given that South Korea and Southeast Asian countries already face lower tariff rates.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with SSNLF.\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe adjustment follows Beijing's earlier decision in August to relax restrictions on some battery-scrap imports in order to increase feedstock availability for recyclers dealing with overcapacity and to reduce reliance on mined resources. Authorities have permitted certain materials that meet domestic standards, including scrap from lithium-iron-phosphate batteries and those containing nickel or cobalt. China already dominates global black-mass processing, but utilization rates remain low after years of aggressive capacity expansion.\nMarket participants suggest the policy change could, in theory, support higher recycling activity, though operational constraints remain significant. Lee Allen of Fastmarkets noted that strict content requirements, particularly around water-soluble fluoride levels, continue to limit trade flows, with much of the global black-mass supply failing to meet China's standards. With payables rising in markets such as South Korea amid tight supply and firm demand, industry focus is increasingly shifting toward technological upgrades that could allow material from Europe and the US to meet Chinese import rules, a trend that could eventually influence cost structures across the electric-vehicle supply chain, including players like Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In Europe, registrations fell sharply in November, Germany, France and several Nordic markets showed steep year-on-year declines, while battery-electric sales overall rose, suggesting Tesla's weakness appears company-specific.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MU.\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nChina presents an even tougher test. The analyst highlights new entrants that priced and launched compelling rivals fast. Xiaomi's YU7, a direct Model Y challenger, reached meaningful sales quickly, and the analyst expects Chinese brands to expand abroad and pressure Tesla's global volumes.\nAutonomy and robotics remain pivotal to the bear thesis. The author doubts Tesla will meet recent robotaxi rollout targets and says Alphabet (GOOG), via Waymo, advances driverless services more steadily. The Optimus humanoid program also shows little production progress, the piece adds.\nOn deliveries, the analyst forecasts a weak Q4 2025 print, below 415,000 units, and projects full-year 2026 volume under 1.5 million vehicles. Consensus sits higher, near 450,000 for Q4, leaving room for downside surprises and near-term stock pressure, the write-up warns.\n\nFinancially, the note outlines falling trailing net income and rising non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation, and offers a bearish valuation exercise that yields a far lower intrinsic value than the market currently implies. Upside risks include outsized Fed easing or a sudden acceleration in Full Self-Driving (FSD) progress.\nWall Street Opinion Based on the one year price targets offered by 42 analysts, the average target price for Tesla Inc is $383.26 with a high estimate of $600.00 and a low estimate of $19.05. The average target implies a downside of -14.78% from the current price of $449.72.\nBased on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $274.12, suggesting a downside of -39.05% from the current price of $449.72. gf value is gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. it is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

      "Content": "BYD overtakes Tesla as China reshapes the global EV race\n\nUna Hajdari\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:34 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BYDDF\n\nTSLA\n\nThe battle of the electric vehicles seems to be comfortably leaning in favour of Chinese producer BYD as Elon Musk's Tesla cars continue to underperform sales-wise, with the Chinese producer posting a nearly 28% increase in year-to-date sales for December.\nTesla sold around 480,000 of its Model 3 and Y in the third quarter, and around 400,000 in the fourth quarter, according to December estimates. 1.6 million models are expected to be sold in 2026, down from about 1.79 million in 2024.\n\nIn comparison, BYD sold about 1.7 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in 2024 and around 2.25 million in 2025. BYD’s total deliveries for BEVs and plug-in hybrids for 2025 reached around 4.6 million vehicles.\nBYD or Build Your Dream has a vehicle line-up that ranges from compact electric city cars and hatchbacks to premium electric sedans and large SUVs, along with hybrid-powered options — as well as larger electric buses and commercial vehicles in many markets worldwide.\nRight now, Tesla’s active customer line-up in 2026 consists of the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X — sedans and SUVs with varying sizes and performance goals — plus the Cybertruck in limited volume. Future cars like the Roadster and robotaxi-style low-cost EVs are anticipated but not yet available as mainstream sales models.\n\nMusk’s politics weigh on Tesla Musk, the South African-born investor and technology entrepreneur, made a high-profile entry into political debates after his $44bn (€37.6bn) acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, which he later rebranded as X.\nFollowing the takeover, Musk increasingly used the platform to air views on immigration, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and European politics — including comments supportive of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\n\nA Yale University study published in October found that Tesla sales would have been 67-83% higher if it weren't for Musk's political activities — equating to 1-1.26 million more vehicles sold. The study concluded that Musk’s actions also boosted sales of other electric and hybrid vehicles by 17-22%.\nMusk later publicly backed Donald Trump and Republican causes, including a $288mn (€246mn) contribution to Trump-aligned political committees during the 2024 election cycle — described in US media as the largest single donation in modern presidential campaign financing.\nAfter Trump’s return to office, Musk was appointed to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which subsequently oversaw the dismantling of USAID, a central vehicle for US international development and humanitarian assistance.\n\nStory Continues\nBefore Musk’s political turn, Tesla vehicles were widely regarded as the benchmark for cutting-edge electric cars and were closely associated with environmental progress and the decarbonisation of road transport.\nRelated\nTesla stock rises as Trump-Musk feud cools and robotaxi launch nears\nNew car registrations fall in Europe and Tesla sees another drop\n\nChina enters the fray Initially, European consumers treated Chinese EVs with scepticism, associating them with lower quality and limited brand recognition.\nBut as BYD and others expanded their model ranges and dealership networks in Europe from late 2022 onwards, their price advantage and technological advancement began shifting demand in Western markets.\n\nIn May of 2025, Chinese carmaker BYD registered more battery-powered electric vehicles in Europe than Tesla for the first time, with 7,231 compared to Tesla's 7,165.\nThis is despite the fact that the European Union introduced tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles following an anti-subsidy investigation by the European Commission.\nThe EU concluded that Chinese EV manufacturers benefitted from state subsidies — including cheap financing, tax breaks, and preferential access to land and raw materials.\nThe bloc subsequently argued that this distorted competition and imposed an additional 17% tariff for BYD on top of the standard 10% car import tariff.\nEven with that tariff, BYD cars remain competitively priced in Europe. A standard Tesla Model 3 starts at roughly €41,000, while comparable Chinese models such as the BYD Dolphin begin at around €35,500. The Dolphin Surf is listed in many European countries from about €22,990.\nLarger BYD vehicles, such as the BYD Seal, typically sit within the €42,700–€48,200 price range in Europe — sometimes similar to or below equivalent Tesla costs. Such pricing helps BYD to appeal to cost-conscious consumers even as EU tariffs raise import costs.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Peter Thiel Sold Nvidia and Tesla to Buy This Other AI Stock\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points Thiel sold a ton of Nvidia and Tesla stock during Q3.\nHe scooped up shares of Apple and Microsoft.\nMicrosoft is well positioned to thrive in 2026 thanks to Azure.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nFew names carry as much weight in the tech realm as Peter Thiel. He has a legendary track record, including being a part of the founding groups of both Palantir and PayPal . He was also the first outside investor in Facebook, now Meta Platforms , making it clear that he has an eye for spotting promising opportunities. When Thiel makes a move, investors should pay attention.\n\nBecause his portfolio is worth more than $100 million, his hedge fund, Thiel Macro, must report its end-of-quarter holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission within 45 days of the end of that quarter via a Form 13F . Those forms are made available to the public. So the most recent information we have on his stock moves is as of Sept. 30, but those moves are noteworthy enough to consider even three months later.\nThiel sold Tesla and Nvidia during Q3 At the end of Q2, Thiel held more than 272,000 shares of Tesla and more than 537,000 shares of Nvidia . At the end of Q3, he owned 65,000 Tesla shares and zero Nvidia shares. Those were huge divestitures, and the Nvidia sale in particular flew in the face of the trends in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm. However, Thiel didn't take these funds and invest them in completely different sectors, like industrial or healthcare. Instead, he put the proceeds of those sales into two other tech megacaps: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) .\n\nApple's AI strategy has been a flop, and it will need to make some major changes to get back in the race. As a result, I don't think Thiel was buying Apple for AI-related reasons (unless he knows something that we don't). I'm more interested in his Microsoft purchase.\nMicrosoft isn't a new holding for Thiel. He has had an on-again, off-again relationship with the stock. As of the end of Q4 2024, he owned no Microsoft shares. By the end of Q1, he owned nearly 80,000 shares. He sold all of them in Q2, then bought nearly 50,000 shares in Q3. Since Sept. 30, Microsoft's stock has declined by around 6%. So unless he has lost his faith in Microsoft, the buying opportunity now could be better than when this information was fresh.\nThe stock is also down by around 2% from June 30. This suggests that right now presents a better buying opportunity than the one that Thiel took advantage of. So should investors follow his lead and buy Microsoft?\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft is acting neutral in the AI buildout Unlike some of its peers, Microsoft chose not to build a generative AI model in-house. Instead, it opted to forge a partnership with OpenAI, and bought a meaningful stake in it. Today, Microsoft owns about 27% of the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC.\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its Copilot product, which acts as an AI assistant for its Office products, Bing search engine, and Windows OS, among other software titles. However, OpenAI's not the only generative AI model maker that Microsoft has a partnership with.\n\nIn its cloud computing segment, Microsoft Azure offers its customers access to multiple models to build applications on. Users can choose from Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, R1 from DeepSeek (a cheaper large language model from China), Meta's Llama, and others. This places Microsoft in a neutral position as a facilitator of the AI software trend. That status helped Azure achieve a jaw-dropping growth rate of 40% in Microsoft's fiscal 2026 first quarter, which ended Sept. 30.\nAzure has become the crown jewel of Microsoft's business, and if it continues to have monster success throughout 2026, Thiel's investment will pay off. Based on its results so far, Microsoft appears well positioned to remain a winner in the AI boom.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $505,641 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,143,283 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 974 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

For the full year 2025, registrations in France declined 37%.\n\nSweden recorded an even steeper annual drop, with December registrations falling 71% to 821 vehicles, leading to an overall 70% annual decline in 2025, based on data from Mobility Sweden.\nBy contrast, Norway, where electric vehicles constitute the vast majority of new car sales, saw a significant increase in Tesla registrations.\nRegistration data showed an 89% year‑on‑year rise in December to 5,679 vehicles, helping Tesla set a new annual record in the country with a market share above 19% in 2025.\nAcross Europe, including Britain and the European Free Trade Association countries, Tesla’s market share slipped to 1.7% up to November 2025, down from 2.4% in the same period of 2024, reflecting weakening relative performance amid broader industry competition.\n\nThe decline in registrations in France and Sweden adds to a trend of faltering Tesla performance in several continental markets through 2025.\nData from earlier months showed similar patterns, with registrations in key countries such as Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands also falling significantly year‑on‑year, although those figures are not part of the December dataset.\nIn France and Sweden, the downward trajectory came despite the rollout of lower‑priced versions of Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle across European markets.\nNorway’s strong performance stands in contrast to the broader European pattern and is consistent with the country’s high adoption rate of battery‑electric vehicles.\nAccording to separate registration data released earlier Friday, Norway’s new car market was nearly 96% electric in 2025, with Tesla leading the segment for the fifth year in a row.\nIn markets outside Norway, overall registration declines have persisted throughout 2025, with Tesla struggling to maintain relevance amid a proliferating range of electric and hybrid vehicles from legacy and new manufacturers.\nRelated articles\nTesla sales plunge in France and Sweden, soar in Norway in December 2025\nSilver's Bullish Pattern Points Higher — Keep an Eye on $52 Resistance Zone\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "BYD Delivers 4.6 Million Vehicles in 2025, Likely Overtakes Tesla\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 3:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBYD ( BYDDF ) met its full-year sales target in 2025 and is expected to have surpassed Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) to become the world's largest electric-vehicle maker, according to company statements and Bloomberg data. The Shenzhen-based automaker delivered 4.6 million vehicles last year, marking a 7.7% increase from 2024 and matching the revised target it set in September. Sales were split almost evenly between fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, while BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 2.3% on the first trading day of the new year, suggesting some near-term investor support despite a more uncertain outlook for China's auto market.\n\nIs BYDDF fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nCompetitive pressures remain elevated across the sector. Tesla is expected to report fourth-quarter deliveries of about 440,900 vehicles, down 11% from a year earlier, which would put full-year deliveries at roughly 1.6 million and mark a second consecutive annual decline, based on Bloomberg-compiled data. Within China, BYD has faced intensifying competition from Geely Automobile Holdings and Xiaomi, alongside reduced purchase incentives and tighter regulatory oversight. Chief Executive Officer Wang Chuanfu said in early December that BYD's technological edge has narrowed and weighed on domestic sales, though he pointed to potential breakthroughs ahead, citing confidence in the company's 120,000-strong engineering team.\n\nOverseas markets have emerged as a key offset. BYD's international deliveries reached 1.05 million vehicles in 2025, exceeding the company's high-end estimate and helping cushion weakness at home, where passenger EV and hybrid sales fell for an eighth straight month and dropped 37.7% in December. Looking ahead, BYD has set an overseas sales target of between 1.5 million and 1.6 million units for 2026, according to a Citigroup report, while analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg suggest total sales could rise to 5.3 million units next year. Still, mounting pressure from back-to-back quarterly profit declines and increased scrutiny of discounting practices could shape a tougher operating environment as consolidation across China's EV sector accelerates.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Naturally, there's bound to be twists and turns that nobody can foresee (2025's giant dip and recovery, anyone?). So obviously, take these 2026 predictions with a healthy dose of skepticism — and as a way to frame some of the things we're watching.\nThe tech giants push through the AI bubble talk It pays to be big.\nFor all the chatter about an AI bubble and renewed investor skepticism about data infrastructure spending, the tech giants aren't changing course.\nWhy would they? Their highly profitable businesses in advertising, e-commerce, software, and the cloud provide an ample cushion to pursue the (still as-of-yet unprofitable) business model of peddling LLMs.\nThe bubble talk won't subside.\nBut it probably won't be the tech giants that falter or face some kind of existential financial reckoning. That's what the smaller tech players and the pure-AI companies will be left to deal with.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nPowell doesn’t get to see his engineered soft landing With only a handful of policy meetings to go under his leadership, it's natural to think of what Fed Chair Jerome Powell's legacy will be .\nHis standing up to the White House in his signature, reserved style, just as Congress and other institutions acquiesced or were diminished, comes to mind.\nBut ask him about it, as a reporter did at the December Fed meeting, and you'll get nothing more than his by-the-book goals: to leave his successor with an economy in good shape and inflation on its way back down to 2%.\nHe won't get to see that by the time his term expires. And the political messiness that will inevitably come from the next Fed Chair's installation will likely overshadow whatever progress comes next with inflation.\nPrediction markets blow up — but so does the pushback Not to be outdone by Robinhood ( HOOD ), Coinbase ( COIN ) is getting in on the prediction market excitement by partnering with Kalshi, allowing users to trade on the outcomes of real-world events.\n\"Who will successfully take over Warner Brothers?\" The money is on Netflix .\n\nStory Continues\nIn one sense, the growth and accessibility of prediction markets is a novel way to measure sentiment, using the logic of markets to suss out what people believe.\nA range of other yes-no contracts, from the next Trump cabinet departure to whether cannabis will be reclassified as a lower drug, highlights how people can monetize their interest in current events — and their intuition.\n\nBut the tandem growth in sports betting has also prompted a public backlash over instant, mass gambling. That same criticism is aimed at prediction markets, raising questions over misconduct, the coverage of the probabilities influencing their outcomes, and of new financial instruments intruding into more aspects of our lives .\nThe Musk trade expands — and diversifies — in a SpaceX IPO If investing in Tesla is just a way to invest in Elon Musk, will the debut of his rocket company help or hurt the automaker's prospects?\nIn 2026, the Musk trade will undoubtedly expand. But not just because this coming year feels like it's shaping up to be the Year of the Robotaxi.\nA forthcoming SpaceX IPO will give shareholders another way to back Musk, even if that means diverting excitement away from Tesla. It's going to be a monumental event: SpaceX's Wall Street launch would mark the largest IPO ever . And it would grant Musk another huge pool of capital to achieve his Martian dreams.\nTaking Twitter private and shaping it into X granted Musk a new level of influence.\nIronically, taking SpaceX public would grant him even more, further entangling and aligning his fortune with the priorities of the federal government. That's one way to stay rich and powerful.\nSpaceX's potential success might also offset whatever delays or hiccups flow from 2026's much-anticipated production of Tesla's Robotaxi .\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in 2026 and Hold for the Rest of the Decade\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 2:40 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nIBM\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's diverse business and comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) stack make the company a safe investment.\nTesla is swinging for the fences with Tesla Optimus, but it best not miss.\nInternational Business Machines is a proven dividend stock, a rarity in the AI space.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe stock market is poised to enter the second half of the 2020s as the new year arrives.\nIt's an exciting time for investors and society as a whole. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past few years has given rise to several new and emerging industries. Self-driving vehicles, humanoid robotics, and quantum computing are just a few of the ways investors could strike it big over the next four to five years.\nHere are three AI stocks investors should consider buying and holding for the rest of this decade. Each stock is unique in what it offers, giving investors some refreshing variety in how to invest in AI's promising future of technological innovation.\n1. This AI stock has a high floor The unpredictable nature of a new and exciting field like AI makes it wise to invest in stocks with a high floor, meaning low chances of a catastrophic outcome. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the internet giant and parent company of Google, is a notable example. It has developed its own AI models and trained them on first-party data, and it owns a top cloud computing platform. That makes it arguably the most complete AI company.\n\nIronically, Alphabet's fate doesn't necessarily rely on AI. Yes, it's a fantastic growth opportunity, but Alphabet's core digital advertising business, through Google and YouTube, generated $74.1 billion in revenue during the third quarter alone. Alphabet's robust profit margins generate billions of dollars in cash flow, which it uses to fund its AI investments without adding prohibitive amounts of debt to its balance sheet.\nIn addition to all that, Alphabet continues to pursue growth in new industries. It is steadily expanding Waymo, its autonomous ride-hailing business, and has ongoing efforts in quantum computing technology. Alphabet's strong core business and stellar companywide performance make it a dependable choice for buy-and-hold investors over the next three to five years.\n\n2. High risk, high reward with this robotics play If you're willing to take a bigger risk for the sake of more upside, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) could be a stock worth considering. Most know Tesla for its electric vehicles and energy storage systems, but CEO Elon Musk has steered the company hard into AI and robotics. More specifically, Musk has argued that its humanoid robot, Tesla Optimus, will eventually represent most of Tesla's value.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Musk has made lofty promises and frequently missed target dates, there's no arguing against Tesla's stock performance, which has vastly outperformed the broader market over the years. That doesn't guarantee future success, but the humanoid robotics market is a massive opportunity. Experts believe it could grow into a $5 trillion total addressable market by 2050.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla's core vehicle business has struggled in recent quarters. That could change for the better, and Tesla's own autonomous ride-hailing service, Robotaxi, launched earlier this year.\nStill, it highlights the stock's potentially low floor if Tesla doesn't deliver on Musk's promises. Investing in Tesla is ultimately a bet on Musk's continued leadership and execution, something investors should consider before purchasing shares.\n3. A rare AI dividend stock AI and technology often scream growth stocks. International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) , also known as IBM, may appeal to investors seeking dividend income. IBM is a longtime player in the tech sector, and to its credit, has managed to evolve with the times, remaining a relevant competitor. It has positioned itself as a leader in hybrid cloud computing, with deep corporate relationships.\n\nIBM is helping its customer base adopt and integrate AI technology, often through consulting services, and is a leading developer of quantum computing systems and development software. The company pays a dividend that currently yields 2.2%, and IBM has raised the dividend for 29 consecutive years, a reflection of its ability to grow over decades.\nIBM continues to expand its AI ecosystem through bolt-on mergers and acquisitions, fertile ground to continue monetizing its customer relationships as a full-tech solutions provider. Analysts anticipate IBM's earnings growing at a high-single-digit annualized rate over the next three to five years. That won't make investors rich overnight, but it will continue to fund dividend increases, with some added price upside along the way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs.\nOther assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds.\nTo be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters.\nTom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026.\n“Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?”\nCrypto market movers Bitcoin is up 1.7% over the past 24 hours, trading at $89,135.\nEthereum is up 2% over the past 24 hours and trading at $3,040.\nWhat we’re reading Six blockbuster crypto IPOs to watch in 2026 — DL News\nBitcoin miners to tap Zaporizhzhia nuclear power — if there’s a peace deal in Ukraine — DL News\nCrypto.com to Hire In-House Market Maker for Prediction Markets — Unchained\nAlt season ‘26: What it will take — Milk Road\nFive crypto airdrops to watch for in 2026 — DL News\nLance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

      "Content": "BYD posts slowest annual sales growth in 5 years, but China’s EV giant is still set to outsell Tesla for the first time\n\nAngelica Ang\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 1:20 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BYDDF\n\nTSLA\n\nBYD’s sales growth fell to 7.7% in 2025 as growing domestic competition in China’s saturated car market sapped momentum at the EV giant. It&#8217;s the slowest pace of growth for the company in five years. BYD sold 4.6 million vehicles last year, compared to 4.3 million in 2024.\nMonthly sales for December dropped by 18.3% year-on-year, falling to around 420,000 cars sold, according to a Jan. 1 exchange filing .\n\nStill, the Chinese EV firm is still likely to overtake Tesla in annual battery electric vehicle sales for the first time. The company sold 2.3 million BEVs in 2025, an increase of 27.9% from the year before.\nOn Dec. 29, Tesla shared analyst estimates that predicted the company sold 1.6 million BEVs in 2025. Analysts also predicted that Tesla will sell 1.8 million cars in 2026, 2 million cars in 2027, and 3 million cars in 2029. This would fall below Musk’s claim in November that the company would sell 4 million cars annually by 2027.\nTesla sales have struggled this year due to consumer distaste with CEO Elon Musk’s sojourn into U.S. politics. The Trump administration also pulled back subsidies for electric cars, which is likely to slow sales further.\n\nThe U.S. car company delivered 1.2 million cars in the first three quarters of 2025; Tesla will likely announce its fourth quarter delivery numbers in early January.\nBYD jumped by 3.6% in Hong Kong trading on Friday. Shares in the EV giant rose by just over 10% over 2025, lagging the broader Hong Kong market. Shares in Tesla rose by 18.6% last year.\nChina’s EV market China’s car market is fiercely competitive, with car manufacturers slashing prices to take market share from their competitors. Heavy investment in EV manufacturing has also led to an oversupply of cars in China, with UBS predicting that the growth rate of EV sales in China will halve in 2026 .\nDomestic competition is pushing China&#8217;s car companies to look overseas for new markets. The country is now the world’s largest car exporter , ahead of traditional carmaking powerhouses like Japan and Germany.\n\nBYD is now the leading EV brand in Southeast Asia, dominating key markets like Thailand and Malaysia. In Singapore, BYD even eclipsed Japanese carmaker Toyota as the top-selling car brand of 2025 .\nThe Chinese car company is also setting its sights on the European market. BYD established its first European car factory in Szeged, Hungary, which is set to start EV production in 2026. The facility will produce about 150,000 compact all-electric sedans a year. BYD is also constructing, or plans to construct, facilities in Thailand, Indonesia, and Brazil.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Just because a business is in the green today doesn’t mean it will thrive tomorrow.\nNot all profitable companies are created equal, and that’s why we built StockStory - to help you find the ones that truly shine bright. That said, here are three profitable companies to avoid and some better opportunities instead.\n\nBentley Systems (BSY) Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 23.7%\nPioneering the concept of \"digital twins\" for infrastructure projects long before it became an industry buzzword, Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) provides software solutions that help engineers design, build, and operate infrastructure projects across sectors including roads, bridges, utilities, mining, and industrial facilities.\n\nWhy Are We Hesitant About BSY?\nProducts, pricing, or go-to-market strategy may need some adjustments as its 10.9% average billings growth over the last year was weak\nEstimated sales growth of 9.7% for the next 12 months is soft and implies weaker demand\nOperating margin expanded by 2.5 percentage points over the last year as it scaled and became more efficient\nBentley Systems’s stock price of $38.34 implies a valuation ratio of 7.9x forward price-to-sales. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including BSY in your portfolio, it’s free for active Edge members .\nTesla (TSLA) Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 4.7%\nOriginally founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle company accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy.\nWhy Do We Avoid TSLA?\nTesla's scale advantage in EV production leads to gross margins that exceed incumbents such as General Motors and Ford. However, a softer macroeconomic backdrop and tariff pressures have weighed on automobile sales, which are highly cyclical.\nThe company's execution ability is a question mark given its long history of delays, such as the Cybertruck and Robotaxi launches. Its sizeable investments in projects with uncertain return timelines, like Optimus, also raise skepticism from investors.\nOn the bright side, Tesla's Megapack product solves a critical problem for utilities needing renewable energy storage solutions. This innovation has made the energy segment the most profitable and fastest-growing business line for the company.\nAt $449.59 per share, Tesla trades at 222.6x forward price-to-earnings. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than TSLA .\n\nStory Continues\nOracle (ORCL) Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 30.3%\nStarting as a database company in 1977 and now powering mission-critical systems across the globe, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) provides enterprise software and hardware products and services that help businesses manage their information technology needs.\nWhy Are We Out on ORCL?\n\nCustomers had second thoughts about committing to its platform over the last year as its average billings growth of 10.4% underwhelmed\nProjected 11 percentage point decline in its free cash flow margin next year reflects the company’s plans to increase its investments to defend its market position\nLimited cash reserves may force the company to seek unfavorable financing terms that could dilute shareholders\nOracle is trading at $193.55 per share, or 7.6x forward price-to-sales. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why ORCL doesn’t pass our bar .\nStocks We Like More The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Strong Momentum Stocks for this week . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that made our list in 2020 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-small-cap company Comfort Systems (+782% five-year return).

      "Content": "Michael Burry Says Tesla Is 'Ridiculously Overvalued' After Earlier Warning About The Elon 'Cult'\n\nVishaal Sanjay\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 6:30 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nInvestor Michael Burry is raising concerns regarding Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) valuations, especially considering its decelerating sales momentum.\nTesla Is ‘Ridiculously’ Overvalued On Tuesday, in a post on X, Burry said, “Tesla is ridiculously overvalued,” after the company shared consensus estimates of its fourth-quarter vehicle sales on Monday, with projected figures coming in below investor expectations.\nThe company compiled estimates from across several prominent sell-side analysts, arriving at a broad consensus of 422,850 units for the current quarter, which is 14.93% below the prior quarter, and down 15% compared to the same period last year.\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAs a result, Tesla is headed for its second consecutive drop in annual vehicle sales, with average estimates at 1,640,752 units, down 8.8%, compared to just under 1.8 million global deliveries in 2024.\nYet, the company remains the most valuable automaker in the world, with a market capitalization of $1.53 trillion, while trading at 204 times forward earnings, which is many times over the industry’s average price-to-earnings ratio of 17.47.\nBurry, who rose to fame for betting against the housing market ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, has been a vocal critic of Tesla’s valuation in recent weeks.\n\nHe made the same statement in his newsletter earlier this month, while also highlighting CEO Elon Musk’s trillion-dollar pay package , which he warned would lead to stock dilution. He said that the company dilutes its shareholders by 3.6% annually, without any corresponding stock buybacks.\n“As an aside, the Elon cult was all-in on electric cars until competition showed up, then all-in on autonomous driving until competition showed up, and now is all-in on robots — until competition shows up,” Burry said. He, however, noted that he does not have a short position against the company right now.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nThis Is ‘Very Unusual’ For Tesla Fund manager and prominent Tesla analyst Gary Black said in a post on X that it was “very unusual” for Tesla to issue a press release with the quarterly sell-side consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n“Obviously, someone at TSLA wanted the IR-derived consensus to be distributed as widely as possible,” he said, while adding that he expects the company’s fourth-quarter deliveries to be in the “420K range than the 445K range.”\nTesla shares were down 1.17% on Tuesday, closing at $454.24, and are down 0.35% overnight.

      "Content": "BYD Hits Sales Goal, Set to Topple Tesla as Biggest EV Maker\n\nLinda Lew, Danny Lee and Bei Hu\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 5:57 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\n(Bloomberg) -- BYD Co. met its full-year sales target and likely surpassed Tesla Inc. to become the world’s largest electric-vehicle maker in 2025 — a milestone overshadowed by a challenging outlook for the Chinese auto market in the year ahead.\nThe Chinese EV giant’s Hong Kong-listed shares rose on the first day of trading for the new year, gaining as much as 2.3%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nSinkholes and Quake-Hit Roads Expose Japan’s Infrastructure Emergency\nThe Shenzhen-based carmaker delivered 4.6 million vehicles last year, up 7.7% from 2024. That’s in line with a lowered full-year goal the company gave in September. Among the mix, it sold almost as many fully-electric vehicles — 2.3 million — as it did plug-in hybrids.\nTesla on Friday is expected to report that it delivered around 440,900 vehicles in the fourth quarter, down 11% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would see annual sales comes in at around 1.6 million — the second consecutive annual drop.\nBYD and its rivals face growing pressure in the coming year as China scales back some incentives supporting EV purchases. An influx of new models is also making domestic competition even fiercer, while trade barriers pose challenges for BYD’s ambitions to expand overseas.\nChina’s best-selling carmaker has faced stiffer competition in the past year from Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. and Xiaomi Corp., whose new models and rapid innovations are winning over consumers. BYD’s shares gained 7% last year, but gave up gains from an early rally that saw its shares jump as much as 74% by late May as tougher competition and increased regulatory scrutiny became more prominent.\n\nBYD’s Chief Executive Officer Wang Chuanfu said at an investor meeting in early December that the technological headstart the company had maintained over the past few years had diminished and affected domestic sales. He hinted at new technology breakthroughs to come, with the company’s 120,000-strong engineering team giving him confidence about its ability to regain advantages, Chinese media reported.\nA bright spot for BYD has been surging overseas sales. Deliveries outside China hit 1.05 million in 2025, exceeding the high-end estimate of 1 million sales, enabling it to offset the company’s decline in its core market. Its passenger EV and hybrid sales fell for the eighth consecutive month, slumping 37.7% in December.\nMorgan Stanley said in a note it forecasts a more meaningful domestic recovery after BYD launches several major facelifts in early 2026 to its line-up.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company has set a goal to expand overseas sales to between 1.5 million to 1.6 million units in 2026, according to a Citigroup Inc. report in November that cited a meeting with BYD management.\nPressure is mounting on BYD after it posted back-to-back declines in quarterly profit and found itself at the center of China’s efforts to rein in aggressive discounting. The growing scrutiny is likely to accelerate consolidation and shake up the hierarchy of the sector.\nSo far, analysts are confident that BYD can weather the challenges better than others. The company’s total sales could grow to 5.3 million units next year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts at Deutsche Bank expect new product launches and the unveiling of a technology platform to boost the company’s competitiveness.\n\nThat could enable BYD to stretch its lead over Tesla, which is struggling with challenges of its own.\nThe US carmaker saw sales plunge in the early part of 2025 as it retooled production lines at each of its assembly plants for the redesigned Model Y. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s polarizing role in the Trump administration also put off some consumers, and the US ending federal purchase subsidies for EVs is expected to drag on demand going forward.\n--With assistance from Charlotte Yang.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThe Memes, Flubs and Trump Dramas That Dominated 2025\nTrump Loves Trade Schools.

He added that politicians like Sanders are \"on the take, because they cannot or will not make.\"\nBernie Sanders' Criticism The comments come as Sanders has criticized Musk and other billionaires on multiple occasions, urging the federal government to introduce taxation on the wealthy part of society. Sanders has also been a vocal critic of Musk's and the tech industry's AI and Robotics push .\nRecently, the lawmaker criticized Musk's and Microsoft Corp.

      "Content": "Here's Why Tesla Will Win the EV Market\n\nLee Samaha, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points Tesla's robotaxis will revolutionize how consumers think about the cost of mobility.\nThe company will begin mass production of Cybercabs in 2026, in anticipation of regulatory approvals for robotaxis.\nEven if robotaxi adoption is slower than anticipated, Tesla can still tactically respond in ways that its peers cannot.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nThe coming year is shaping up to be a pivotal one for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and it will be a year in which the underlying debate about the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry will come into intense focus. There are two polemic positions that automakers and investors can take on the debate, but as ever, the reality probably lies somewhere in between.\nThe good news for Tesla investors is that the company has the opportunity to emerge victorious, regardless of the outcome.\nThe great debate over electric vehicles The crux of the matter was outlined during Tesla's third earnings call in 2024 when management fielded a question on the timing of a $25,000 \"non-robotaxi regular car model.\" Musk's response was to reiterate that \"the future is autonomous electric vehicles,\" which he then claimed most automakers hadn't \"internalized\" yet. He went on to argue that \"I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless\" and \"It's fully considered cost per mile is what matters.\"\n\nMusk is arguing that the lower cost per mile advantage of EVs becomes apparent when the car is driven. Moreover, if the car driven is an autonomous EV in the form of a robotaxi, then that advantage is even higher. Consequently, the most efficient use of an EV is as a robotaxi.\nIn terms of cost per mile, you could think of matters as follows: Tesla Cybercab robotaxi > Tesla transformed into robotaxi using autonomous full self driving (FSD) > EVs (including Teslas) > regular internal combustion engine (ICE) car > ICE taxi.\nEstimates for the cost per mile fluctuate due to external factors (such as fuel costs), but for a rough idea, Musk has mentioned as low as $0.30 per mile for a Cybercab, compared to an average of over $2 for an ICE taxi.\n\nThere are a couple of points to consider in addition to this argument. First, a Tesla with autonomous FSD has the potential to have a lower cost per mile than other EVs because the software can drive it in a more efficient manner.\nSecond, and this is a crucial point in the ICE world, the ICE taxi is the more expensive option on a cost-per-mile basis, which is a major reason why consumers buy cars. However, in the EV world, a consumer will see a robotaxi as a cheaper option on a cost-per-mile basis.\n\nStory Continues\nAs such, the advent of robotaxis will usher in a fundamentally different way of thinking about mobility than applied in the ICE era.\nTesla's robotaxi plan is to build that future, and investors are buying the stock in anticipation of a massive stream of recurring revenue from its robotaxis in the future. That's why Tesla is aggressively pursuing its robotaxi rollout .\n\nThe market needs cheaper electric vehicles The alternative view has it that the immediate future of the EV industry (the growth area of the auto market) is through the development of low-cost models to reduce the overall cost of ownership. That's why Ford (whose management, in 2016, promised commercial robotaxis by 2021) is investing $5 billion in a universal EV platform, with the aim of offering a $30,000 electric pickup truck in 2027.\n\nMoreover, Ford and General Motors (an automaker that only ended robotaxi development in 2024) are among many automakers that have scaled back their pre-existing EV plans in response to weaker-than-expected sales in 2025 and significant losses on their EV investments.\nThey believe they are responding to consumer preferences, and the near future will feature the kind of affordable EVs that Musk thought were \"pointless,\" as discussed above.\nWhich side is right? They are probably both right, at least in the near term.\nThe costly Cybertruck and Ford's F-150 Lightning pickup truck have underperformed in sales, while Tesla's most affordable car, the Model 3, has seen sales growth of nearly 18% through 2025, and GM's affordable Chevy Equinox has also experienced strong sales growth. At the same time, the pace of robotaxi rollouts, adoption, and regulatory approval is uncertain and slower than most hoped it would be.\nHowever, Tesla and others are making progress on robotaxis, and the long-term case remains intact. It appears to be an issue of timing.\nWhy Tesla could win either way But here's the thing. Tesla is well-positioned to strategically win in the long term with its robotaxi development, and it's arguably best positioned to win in the near term if the transition takes longer than expected. Unlike peers like Ford and GM, Tesla's EV business is profitable, and in fact, it's already producing lower-cost versions of the Model Y and Model 3 in reaction to market conditions.\n\nIt also has the market position and scale to develop lower-cost models. While that's no guarantee that Tesla will produce one if the robotaxi transition is slow, the company is in a much better position to do so than its peers, and that counts for a lot in the investing world.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Tesla Sales Outlook Darkens Despite Musk’s Self-Driving Euphoria\n\nKara Carlson\nUpdated Thu, January 1, 2026 at 5:07 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nWSFX.BO\n\n(Bloomberg) — Tesla ( TSLA ) Inc. ended last year on a roll, with investors increasingly buying into Elon Musk’s ebullience about autonomous vehicles. Winning over actual car buyers was another story.\nShares in the world’s most valuable auto company soared in the second half, largely on the basis of its chief executive officer touting advances in artificial intelligence and robotics. But the progress Musk trumpeted didn’t translate to success in showrooms — the company likely sold fewer vehicles in the last six months than a year earlier, despite record deliveries in the third quarter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nSinkholes and Quake-Hit Roads Expose Japan’s Infrastructure Emergency\nOn Friday, Tesla is expected to report that it delivered around 440,900 vehicles in the fourth quarter, down 11% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla took the unusual step this week of publishing its own average of analyst estimates that was even more pessimistic, calling for a 15% decline.\n\nWall Street has grown similarly gloomy about the outlook for 2026. This time two years ago, analysts were predicting Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles. That average estimate for deliveries this year has plunged to roughly 1.8 million.\n“Tesla investors are focused on how the company might look five, 10, 15 years down the road, and really discounting what they see in the near term,” Garrett Nelson, an equity analyst at CFRA Research, said by phone. “The question is, can they maintain that, especially when we think headwinds are going to become more apparent in the financials?”\nTopsy-Turvy Even by the standards of Musk and Tesla — two names synonymous with turbulence — 2025 was a tumultuous year.\nThe carmaker’s vehicle sales got off to a dismal start, partly due to the company retooling production lines at each of its auto plants for the redesigned Model Y, its most popular vehicle. Another major factor was the intense backlash against its CEO’s work for US President Donald Trump.\n\nBy early April, when Musk was publicly feuding with members of the administration over tariff policy, Tesla’s stock had plummeted 45% for the year.\nMusk spurred the recovery by stepping back from government and returning to work on a longtime goal: starting a ride-hailing business with cars he’s said will eventually be autonomous.\nIn June, Tesla launched an invite-only Robotaxi service in Austin, with safety operators on board to supervise each of the Model Ys ferrying Musk fans around the Texas capital. While the vehicles violated traffic laws on day one — drawing the attention of a federal regulator that’s opened multiple investigations into the company’s driving systems — investors have shrugged off the safety concerns.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla’s board then proposed a new compensation package for Musk in September, offering a payout potentially worth $1 trillion depending on milestones including delivering millions of robotaxis. Soon after, the comeback was complete — Tesla shares were trading higher for the year.\nWhen the stock closed at a new all-time high on Dec. 16, the company had added more than $915 billion in market capitalization in just over eight months.\n\nNeeding Convincing But while Tesla’s robotaxi prospects have captivated investors, car buyers have been relatively circumspect.\nMusk himself has acknowledged challenges persuading consumers to purchase what Tesla markets as Full Self-Driving, or FSD, a suite of features that still require human supervision. Allegations that Tesla is misleading Californians by exaggerating the automated-driving capabilities of its vehicles could lead to the state suspending the company’s sales license for 30 days early this year.\n\nTesla’s attempt to distinguish itself in China’s crowded electric vehicle market with driver-assistance functions also isn’t working out, with companies including BYD Co. and Xiaomi Corp. offering similar systems as standard features.\nDue largely to BYD’s far higher sales in China and surge of momentum in Europe — where Tesla has been unable to obtain regulatory approval for FSD — analysts expect the Shenzhen-based carmaker to have sold more battery-electric vehicles worldwide for a fifth quarter in a row.\nMoving Forward After a widely anticipated annual sales decline — its second in a row — Tesla has more hurdles to contend with in 2026. The US has ceased offering federal tax credits for EV purchases and leases, which Musk has warned could lead to “a few rough quarters.”\nSome see a silver lining in the withdrawal of US policy support, which has led major manufacturers to pull back from EV investments. Ford Motor Co. said last month it expects to record about $19.5 billion in charges tied to abandoning EV and battery projects that were destined to lose money.\n\nMusk ended the year by building anticipation for Cybercab, a two-seat compact car with butterfly doors. While the prototype he first unveiled in late 2024 lacked a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm told Bloomberg News in October that the company will sell the car with those components if required by regulators.\n“Investors have fully bought into his autonomous vision, which comes at a good time, as Tesla’s EV business will likely be flat to up 5 percent next year,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. “At this point, Elon only needs the car business to stabilize over the next year to satisfy investors.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThe Memes, Flubs and Trump Dramas That Dominated 2025\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\n©2026 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla Is About to Report Fourth-Quarter Deliveries. The Number May Be Weak -- And Investors May Not Care\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 4:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points The expiration of a federal clean-vehicle credit at the end of Q3 likely led to a pull-forward in demand during the period.\nWhile Q4 numbers from Tesla may be weak, investors should zoom out and look at the bigger picture.\nThere are catalysts on the horizon that could accelerate Tesla's vehicle sales growth again -- likely sometime in 2026.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nDespite returning to double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in Q3, fueled by a return to growth in vehicle deliveries, it's unlikely that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) kept up this momentum in Q4, despite recently introducing a lower-cost version of its Model Y. This is because Q3 benefited from a pull-forward in demand as buyers rushed to get electric vehicles before the federal electric-vehicle credit expired. In addition, deliveries far exceeded production in Q3 -- a factor that will likely weigh on fourth-quarter deliveries.\nWe'll soon find out exactly how many vehicles Tesla delivered, as the company typically reports its quarterly deliveries within the first few days following the last day of its quarters. This means the electric-car maker will likely report its fourth-quarter deliveries on January 2nd or 3rd.\nAhead of the delivery release, here's a closer look at why fourth-quarter deliveries likely won't be impressive -- and why the story is bigger than Q4 anyway.\nWhy Q4 could be weak The federal clean-vehicle credit created a hard deadline for electric vehicle shoppers of Sept. 30, 2025. The credit was no longer available for qualifying vehicles purchased after this date, giving buyers a reason to pull future purchases into the third quarter.\nTesla 's own data on vehicle deliveries show just how significant the acceleration in demand was in Q3. Total third-quarter deliveries rose 7% year over year. That was after they fell 13% year over year in Q2.\n\nIn addition to a pull-forward in demand in Q3, the company benefited from delivering more vehicles than it produced in the period. Specifically, total third-quarter deliveries were 497,088, and total vehicles produced came in at just 447,450.\nThis inventory drawdown, combined with the loss of a major catalyst for orders, will make achieving big delivery figures difficult for Tesla in Q4.\nThere's more to the story than Q4 Of course, investors shouldn't get too hung up on what Tesla reports for fourth-quarter deliveries. Clearly, there are some major headwinds working against the company during the period. What matters is the long-term trajectory -- and Tesla executives have had plenty to say about that.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla's chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja explained in Tesla's third-quarter earnings call that he believes the company has an important catalyst on the horizon that may help. But it may take some time to start showing up in the numbers.\n\"We feel that as people experience the supervised [full self-driving] at scale, demand for our vehicles, ... [will] increase significantly,\" said Taneja.\n\nEven more, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in the third-quarter call that when the company achieves unsupervised full self-driving, demand will accelerate further. Further, he stated that he's confident enough in the path to autonomy that the company is already planning to ramp up production as quickly as possible.\nAll of this to say, Tesla's fourth-quarter delivery figures might come in at an unimpressive level, but investors will likely need to zoom out beyond the quarter's reported deliveries to get the full story.\nTesla's fourth-quarter earnings release, which typically occurs later in January, will likely be insightful because management will likely provide a timely update on vehicle demand trends. In addition, the company may provide full-year guidance, giving investors even more context.\n\nWhatever the case, the bar his high. The growth stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 310. Clearly, investors have no problem looking past a potentially weak Q4. A valuation like this puts immense pressure on Tesla to deliver on its autonomous driving aspirations.\nEven if Tesla achieves unsupervised full self-driving capability in its vehicles, there's a big question mark regarding the timing. When will full self-driving be achieved? When will it be achieved at scale? And how fast will it impact demand, and to what degree?\n\nHopefully, Tesla investors will get answers to some of these questions throughout 2026.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "The World’s Wealthiest People Got $2.2 Trillion Richer This Year\n\nRachel Cormack\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:00 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThe rich just keep getting richer.\nThe world’s 500 wealthiest individuals added a record $2.2 trillion to their collective fortunes this year, as reported by Bloomberg . America’s tech moguls were the biggest winners, with a stock market boom in artificial intelligence companies resulting in massive gains.\n\nMore from Robb Report\nBeyoncé Is Officially a Billionaire\nA Miami Manse With a Wraparound Pool and Private Dock Just Listed for $30 Million\nThis New Coffee-Table Book Showcases 100 Rare and Revolutionary Watches\nOf the top 10 richest individuals, the eight in the tech industry added more than half a trillion dollars to their collective wealth in 2025. Tesla founder Elon Musk, currently the world’s richest man , raked in $190 billion in the past 12 months, taking his total net worth to $623 billion, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . He is on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, if Tesla hits the ambitious targets it has set.\nGoogle cofounder Larry Page also had a prosperous year, with a $101 billion gain pushing his personal fortune to $270 billion. Rounding out the top five, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made $16 billion (net worth: $255 billion), Google cofounder Sergey Brin pulled in $92.5 billion (net worth: $251 billion), and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison earned $57.7 billion (net worth: $250 billion). Ellison briefly overtook Musk as the world’s richest man in September, after his business software company reported unexpectedly strong financial results. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also saw his wealth rise $28 billion in 2025, taking his net worth to $235 billion, according to the index.\n\nAmidst all those tech tycoons, luxury’s biggest name sits at seventh in the billionaire rankings. LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault , who has spent his fair share of time at the top of the list , enjoyed a $30 billion gain this year, taking his total fortune to $206 billion. LVMH, which helms the likes of Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., TAG Heuer, and Dom Pérignon, returned to growth in the third quarter of 2025, buoyed by the strong spending of wealthy North Americans.\nArnault sits ahead of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who made $30 billion and $23 billion in 2025, respectively. Huang sold nearly $1 billion worth of shares this year, cashing in on the soaring stock price of the computer chip maker. (Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company in October.) Last but not least, billionaire investor Warren Buffett pulled in $9.54 billion, resulting in a total fortune of $152 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIt’s been a very good year for some.\nSign up for RobbReport'sNewsletter .

      "Content": "2 Luxury EV Stocks Headed to $0, And 1 That Could Make You a Multimillionaire\n\nRich Smith, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nLCID\n\nKey Points Investors love Rivian lately, and it's in a better state than Lucid. But both EV stocks are burning cash fast.\nTesla suffers from negative PR, but it's one of the only profitable, cash-generative EV stocks in the world.\n10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›\nAre you ready for a bold prediction (that's really patently obvious)? OK then, here goes: Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) and even more so Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) are both going to zero.\nAnd now, I'll tell you why.\nRivian Automotive There's a lot of optimism surrounding Rivian stock lately. Shares of the electric truck-maker are down a staggering 80% from their closing price on its IPO (initial public offering) day in 2021. However, they're up 55% from their recent low in early November, when the company reported its most recent financial report (for Q3 2025).\n\nAnd yes, at first glance, that news was encouraging. Rivian grew its revenue 78% year over year in Q3. It cleared out old inventory, producing 10,720 electric vehicles (EVs) in the quarter but delivering 13,201 to customers. Rivian even earned a positive gross profit of $24 million -- the third time it's ever accomplished that feat.\nCEO RJ Scaringe boasted of \"significant progress\" the company's making with its operations, including advancing plans to introduce its new lower-priced R2 electric SUV , priced at $45,000, in the first half of 2026. To support the rollout, it has built a 1.1 million-square-foot R2 body shop and general assembly facility, a 1.2 million-square-foot supplier park and logistics center, and a paint shop capable of coloring 215,000 units per year. It has also broken ground on a second U.S. manufacturing facility in Georgia, which will be capable of producing an additional 400,000 units annually.\n\nBut here's the thing: Rivian sold 13,201 EVs in Q3. Annualized, that's about 50,000 units -- far fewer than it can paint at its existing facility and far, far fewer than the 400,000 units it's ramping up to build in Georgia. And yet, it took the expiration of federal EV tax credits in Q3, which drove buyers to snap up EVs last quarter, to boost demand for Rivians even to this still-low level.\nWith Q4 now underway, and the tax credits naught but a pleasant memory, can Rivian sustain its sales momentum in 2026 -- even with the R2 to help?\nPersonally, I'm skeptical. Q3 notwithstanding, the long-term trends don't currently favor Rivian. Moreover, Rivian is down to less than $2 billion in net cash on its balance sheet, and analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast the company must spend $3.6 billion on capital expenditures next year (and $2.4 billion more in 2027).\n\nStory Continues\nUnless R2 turns out to be a smashing success, Rivian's going to be running on proverbial fumes soon. Investors who've bid the stock up this past month don't appear to comprehend the risk they're running.\nLucid Group The situation with Lucid is similar -- but worse. On the one hand, Car and Driver just named the Lucid Gravity a 10Best for trucks & SUVs in 2026 and the Lucid Air Pure a 10Best car. However, the Gravity starts at $79,900, and the Pure is only slightly cheaper at $70,900 -- neither is particularly affordable.\n\nLucid's sales are up 45% so far this year, but its gross and operating losses are still climbing. It almost seems as if the more cars Lucid sells, the more money Lucid loses. The entire company is worth only $3.8 billion at current market prices, yet Lucid is burning through $3.4 billion in negative free cash flow annually, and its balance sheet is already in the red.\nAt last report, Lucid had only $2.3 billion in cash against $2.8 billion in debt. To stave off insolvency, the company had to sell $975 million worth of convertible senior notes -- debt that will likely be converted into shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders in the future.\nLucid's in even worse shape than Rivian, I fear -- and its stock is probably closer to zero.\n\nRemember Tesla? At this point, you may ask, \"Is there any EV stock worth owning?\" You may be surprised to hear that the first EV stock ever is also probably still the strongest bet on EV stocks today: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nIs Tesla still suffering from an Elon Musk hangover? It is. The Tesla CEO remains a veritable perpetual motion machine, producing negative PR for his company. And yet, Tesla itself is still doing surprisingly well -- at least relative to the alternatives.\n\nBad PR or no, Tesla earned $4.8 billion in positive profit over the last 12 months, more than any of its EV rivals, with the exception of BYD , which reported earning $5.5 billion. Tesla has $28 billion more cash in the bank than debt on its balance sheet and remains free-cash-flow positive, generating $6.8 billion in positive cash profits over the past year. (BYD burned $3.5 billion in cash.)\nIt sounds surreal to say it in the current anti-Musk environment, but if you want to earn millions investing in EV stocks, Tesla is probably still your very best bet.\nShould you buy stock in Lucid Group right now? Before you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lucid Group wasn’t one of them.

The big one as I we were just talking about Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett is out. We got P&G, Target, Walmart, Lulu Lemon, the list goes on.\n00:17 Speaker B\nWell, I think uh first of all, Warren Buffett, there's no one that can replace Warren and what he has done. He is a legend, he's done it for 60 years. But his principles are so basic that I think Greg A Abel is his successor, will carry them on, will not make major changes.\n00:42 Speaker B\nAnd I think Berkshire Hathaway's approach to investing uh will continue as it is. So I I'm optimistic about that. I think some of the uh biggest changes are going to come on the retail front.\n00:57 Speaker B\nYou see uh Walmart, uh I think Doug Mcmillan is one of the finest CEOs in the world today along with Satya Nadela at Microsoft and Jamie Diamond at City. and he's stepping down in February and John Furner's taking over.\n01:16 Speaker B\nAnd if you look at Furner, 30 years, like the ideal grooming he's been CEO of Sam's Club, he's been chief marketing officer, chief merchandising officer. He runs all the US operations.\n01:31 Speaker B\nAnd Walmart is very well positioned to continue to dominate retail including the online business. So obviously have strong competition from Amazon, but I think you'll see Walmart doing well.\n01:45 Speaker B\nThe biggest changes I predict are going to come in Target, which has had a disastrous year uh under Brian Cornell's last year. And I think under Michael Fidelki, uh he's going to return Target to its roots of competing on design and style and having unique offerings that are different from Walmart, more upscale.\n02:05 Speaker B\nCornell's taking them down a bit on a lower scale and abandoned a lot of things Target stood for when I was on the board. So I think you'll see Michael doing a terrific job in restoring uh Target. He like Furner knows the business has been in every aspect of it, and I think he'll do a very good job.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Gary Black Calls Tesla's Move To Release Delivery Estimate Data 'Highly Unusual:' Says Delivery Shortfall Could Coincide With Robotaxi Announcement\n\nBadar Shaikh\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:31 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nGary Black , managing director at The Future Fund LLC , thinks that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) releasing delivery estimates preemptively is an atypical move on the Elon Musk -led EV giant's part.\n‘Highly Unusual,' Says Gary Black On Monday, the investor, sharing his thoughts in a post on X, said that it was \"highly unusual\" for the EV giant to share \"quarterly consensus delivery estimates\" via a press release. He shared that delivery consensus among analysts for the fourth quarter hovered around the 445k-mark, but the press release illustrated delivery estimates of around 423k.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\"Obviously, someone at TSLA wanted the IR-derived consensus to be distributed as widely as possible,\" Black said. Out of the almost 423k deliveries Tesla predicts, over 388k comprise the Model Y and Model 3 sales, according to the data shared by the EV giant.\nA Major Announcement? The investor also shared that the delivery estimates could also coincide with a major announcement by Tesla. \"One has to align a potential 4Q delivery shortfall,\" Black said, with the expectation of the EV giant announcing the removal of \"some or all safety monitors\" from the Robotaxis in Austin.\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nIt’s worth noting that Tesla has recently been conducting driverless testing operations of its Robotaxi in Austin, as confirmed by Musk. The EV maker’s Cybercab was also spotted in Austin, though it wasn’t immediately clear if the car was being driven by a human or operating autonomously.\nSee Also: Missed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nGene Munster On Tesla Deliveries, Falling Sales The comments come as investor Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management Had predicted that the EV giant's deliveries would fall short of expectations in the fourth quarter. Munster predicted delivery figures to be around the 415k mark for Tesla, citing headwinds related to the end of the Federal EV Credit, among other reasons.\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, the EV giant recorded consistent declines in sales performance, with November U.S. sales falling 23% and sales in Europe declining almost 12% year-on-year (YoY) last month. Meanwhile, Tesla's Chinese rival BYD Co. Ltd. (OTC: BYDDY ) (OTC: BYDDF ) recorded a 222% growth in sales in the region.\n\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "Stocks end the year up a solid 16% as AI hype powers gains\n\nJennifer Sor\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:28 PM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDATA-USD\n\nNEAR-USD\n\nMTL-USD\n\nOP-USD\n\n2025 was a volatile year for stocks, crypto, and other asset classes.\nThe S&P 500 ended the year up 16%, a far cry from the near-bear-market it fell into several months ago.\nDetailed below are the 10 wildest moments that defined 2025 for investors.\n2025 was a wild year for markets of all kinds.\nEverything from stocks to crypto to commodities experienced a rollercoaster ride that amounted to what felt like an especially volatile year.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the benchmark S&P 500 rose 16%, a solid return, although it still fell short of 2023 and 2024. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fared slightly better, posted a 20% gain.\nSome of the key events feel like ages ago. (Remember when China's DeepSeek AI model spurred a panic across US tech ?) Others are more recent. (It's been hard to miss the record-setting rallies in metals .)\nAll in all, it ended up another solidly green year for stocks and commodities, while bitcoin ultimately fell. Here's the final scorecard for some of the most high-profile parts of the market:\nS&P 500 : +16%\nNasdaq 100 : +20%\nDow Jones Industrial Average : +13%\nNvidia : +39%\nGold : +64%\nBitcoin : -7%\nWith that in mind, detailed below — in rough chronological order — are the wildest moments that defined the year for investors:\nThe Trump family launches its own crypto tokens\nPresident Donald Trump and his wife unveiled their own crypto tokens the day leading up to the presidential inauguration.\nThe move, which was unprecedented for a US president and raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest within the new administration, also kicked off a flurry of interest in meme coins .\n\nPerformance-wise, the Trump-branded tokens have floundered throughout the year. $Trump , which soared to around $45 the night leading up to the inauguration, has plummeted 90% from its peak. $Melania, which climbed to $8.48 in late January, has endured a 98% plunge.\nDeepSeek sparks a $1 trillion sell-off\nAI stocks were shaken by the launch of DeepSeek in January, the Chinese AI chatbot that appeared to rival ChatGPT's abilities despite using cheaper and inferior Nvidia chips. In a single day, fears around DeepSeek wiped away around $1 trillion in value , largely in the US tech sector.\nThe LLM was one of the first catalysts to spark concern about the billions mega-cap tech firms in the US are spending on AI , and whether the investment would be worth it from an ROI perspective. It also sparked fear that the US could be losing its dominance in the artificial intelligence space.\nCrypto's post-election crash\nCrypto suffered a brutal sell-off in the months following Trump's inauguration, undoing much of the rally that sent tokens rocketing higher after the self-branded \" crypto president \" first won the election in November.\n\nStory Continues\nBitcoin , the OG cryptocurrency, rallied to a peak of around $106,000 in late January before tumbling 28% to $75,000 in early April.\n\nEthereum , the second-largest crypto token, plunged around 60% from its peak in December through mid-April.\nCrypto markets got a big boost when Trump first secured his second term in office, with investors being excited by the prospect of a more crypto-friendly administration. That optimism has fluctuated at various points throughout the year, tied to factors like concerns about Fed rate cuts and broader risk sentiment in the market.\nTrump announces his Liberation Day tariffs\nWho could forget the stock market crash that ensued when Trump unveiled his Liberation Day tariffs ?\nThe president, who had teased April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" for the US in posts on Truth Social, followed through with his threats to impose sweeping tariffs on the US's top trading partners, which included a 10% universal tariff and reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 nations.\n\nInvestors immediately panicked over the economic implications of tariffs and whether they could stoke higher prices, burdening an already slowing US economy.\nThe S&P 500 plunged 12% from its closing price on April 2 through the following Tuesday. At its low, the index was down 19% from its peak in mid-February, on the cusp of bear-market territory.\nTrump suggests he could fire Powell\nPresident Trump intensified his attacks on the Fed Chair at various points throughout the year.\nTrump, who appointed Jerome Powell to the role during his first term, has long pressured Powell to lower rates at his whim. But his feud with the central bank chief appeared to reach a new level this year as he called on rates to be lowered ASAP and referred to Powell as \"stupid,\" \"Too Late,\" and other names on Truth Social.\n\nIn April, Trump said that Powell leaving the Fed couldn't come soon enough, leading US stocks to drop sharply.\nStocks sold off again in July when Bloomberg reported that Trump could fire Powell soon. The 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term rates in the economy, also rose in these instances.\nThe comments from Trump's administration are considered by many to be unprecedented, given that most past presidents have let the Fed operate independently. They've also sparked fear that inflation could rise if the president were to intervene in monetary policy, which could raise rates in the long run.\nIn April, Trump clarified that he had no intention of firing Powell from his post. But the president still appeared to flirt with the idea as a hypothetical when speaking to reporters at the Mar-a-Lago this week.\nTesla's historic plunge (and recovery)\nTesla staged a massive turnaround this year after plummeting over the first four months of 2025.\nShares of the EV maker were down more than 50% from their peak in December 2024, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk 's presence on Capitol Hill.\nThe stock is now up more than 100% from its April low, driven by a handful of catalysts.\n\nMusk, who has long frustrated Tesla investors with his many side-projects and growing involvement in US politics, appeared to ignite the rebound in April when he said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first quarter earnings call.\nThe stock moved higher in the coming months as the Tesla board approved a pay package with ambitious targets for Musk, and Musk signaled his commitment to the company by purchasing another $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.\n\nThe US and China strike trade agreements\nThe US struck a series of trade agreements with China, which helped stocks grind higher to new records this summer. Here's the timeline of what happened:\nMay: The US and China agree to lower tariffs for 90 days . Stocks immediately surged on the news, with all three indexes climbing more than 2%.\nJune : The US and China agree to a framework trade deal . US stocks ticked slightly higher, but were mostly unmoved.\nAugust : The US and China extend their trade truce for another 90 days. Stocks jumped, with the Dow rising more than 400 points.\nOctober: The US and China reach another trade deal framework . The indexes closed at record-highs, with the S&P 500 breaking through 6,800 for the first-ever time.\n\nThe long-running rift between the US and China on trade has been one of the biggest issues weighing on investors this year, particularly within the context of Trump's latest tariffs. When trade tensions were at their peak, the US was threatening to slap a 145% tariff on goods imported from the nation, and China was threatening to impose a 125% tariff on US goods.\nPresident Trump and Elon Musk have a public breakup\nTesla shares swung in June as Elon Musk and Donald Trump had a massive falling out online.\nThe two billionaires began to spar on their respective social media platforms after Musk published a post criticizing the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Tesla shares plunged 17% in the two days following June 3, when Musk first posted about the bill.\n\nIn the heat of the conflict, Trump threatened to slash government contracts with Musk's sprawling empire of companies. The White House also said Trump was considering giving away or selling the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year to support Musk.\nOn X the following week, Musk said that he believed his posts about Trump \"went too far.\" In an interview with The New York Post on the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice,\" which appeared to alleviate the selling pressure on Tesla.\nThe stock ended up climbing 6% to end the week.\nNvidia hits a $5 trillion valuation\nNvidia , the world's most valuable company by market cap, became the first-ever to hit a $4 trillion valuation in July. It was also the first to hit the $5 trillion milestone in October.\nShares of the chipmaker are up 35% year-to-date and up 1,338% over the last five years, speaking to the enormous hype surrounding AI hardware.\nGold, silver, and copper hit all-time highs\nGold, silver, and copper each rallied to all-time highs as investors sought out alternative investments that could hedge against risk and took interest in metals related to the AI trade.\nAll of the metals are also facing a supply-demand imbalance, another factor that's pushed up prices.\nHere's how each performed in 2025:\nGold : up 66% year-to-date\nSilver : up 153% year-to-date\nCopper : up 41% year-to-date\nGold and silver are on track for their best year since 1979 . Copper, meanwhile, is on track for its best performance since the Great Financial Crisis .\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2026?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 10:09 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points The company commands a market capitalization of about $1.5 trillion as investors have big hopes for Robotaxi.\nTesla's sales have been lackluster recently, making self-driving technology key to the bull case.\nElon Musk believes the realization of unsupervised full self-driving technology will lead to a surge in demand for Tesla's vehicles.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) heads into 2026 with a split narrative. The electric-car company is still the biggest name in electric vehicles, but the market increasingly treats it like an AI (artificial intelligence) and autonomy story. After all, that's the best explanation for the stock's rise this year, even as vehicle deliveries have been lackluster. The company's progress on self-driving vehicles and an autonomous ride-sharing fleet (Robotaxi) has excited investors, as they hope the company will increasingly benefit from higher-margin, faster-growing revenue streams in 2026 and beyond.\nGoing into 2026, the question is whether Tesla will begin to show substantial progress on Robotaxi, giving investors a clearer vision of how the company can generate substantial profits from the initiative. The company's market capitalization of $1.5 trillion already demands that Robotaxi is a major success; so if it doesn't start showing up in the numbers soon, investors might punish the stock.\nWith this background in mind, it's a good time to take a closer look at the growth stock to see if it's a good buy today (or not).\nMixed financial results Tesla's financial results throughout 2025 show why investors need a big win from Robotaxi going forward. In Q2, the company's total revenue fell 12% year over year to $22.5 billion, and Tesla's operating margin was 4.1%, down from 6.3% in the year-ago quarter. And while revenue rose 12% year over year in Q3, this was because there was a pull-forward in demand; customers raced to get their hands on Tesla vehicles before the federal electric vehicle credit expired.\n\nImportantly, Tesla is still generating free cash flow. Third-quarter free cash flow was nearly $4 billion, up 46% year over year.\nIn addition, Tesla's energy business has been doing particularly well with 12.5 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy storage deployed in Q3 -- up 81% year over year. This was the primary driver behind Tesla's energy generation and storage segment's 44% year-over-year revenue growth during the period.\nOverall, though, Tesla's financial results in 2025 have been disappointing. Even in Q3, when total revenue grew by a double-digit rate, Tesla's net income declined 37% year over year to about $1.4 billion. Even Tesla's non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income declined 29% during the period.\n\nStory Continues\nThe bull case Obviously, these financial results, in and of themselves, don't justify Tesla $1.5 trillion market capitalization or its price-to-earnings ratio of 313.\nThe growth stock's valuation is leaning on what comes next: the rollout of Robotaxi.\n\"We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in the company's third-quarter earnings release when talking about how fast Robotaxi can take off when the software is ready.\n\nMusk went on to say that, given his confidence in achieving unsupervised full self-driving, he plans to increase the electric-car company's vehicle production as quickly as he can -- ahead of an expected surge in demand for its vehicles due to their self-driving technology.\n\nTesla plans for its vehicle owners to eventually be able to deploy their vehicles into the autonomous Robotaxi ride-sharing network, allowing them (alongside Tesla) to earn money from their vehicles. In addition, Tesla is working on a vehicle built from the ground up for autonomous driving -- the Cybercab.\nRisks But there are a number of key risks Tesla investors need to consider carefully.\nThe most obvious one is that the stock's extraordinarily high valuation may already price in the arrival of unsupervised self-driving technology.\nIn addition, it's also possible that Tesla's Robotaxi service will not be as lucrative as management anticipates. Indeed, Tesla's chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja already told investors in the company's third-quarter earnings call that he expects Tesla's capital expenditures in 2026 to \"increase substantially as we prepare the company for the next phase of growth.\"\n\nFurther, there's regulatory risk. For now, technological progress is the primary limiting factor for the speed with which Tesla expands its Robotaxi service. But another bottleneck that may slow the Robotaxi expansion is regulatory approvals. It's unclear how fast regulatory agencies will move to legalize unsupervised full self-driving ride-sharing services across the U.S.\nFinally, there's the risk that competition from other self-driving companies, like Alphabet 's Waymo or Amazon 's Zoox will turn what is supposed to be a major profit driver for Tesla into something that more closely resembles a price-sensitive commodity.\nGiven these risks (especially the stock's extremely high valuation), I personally think Tesla shares are a \"hold\" going into 2026. I believe buying after such a huge run-up in the stock price could prove to be a mistake. Given the stock's volatility, I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback at some point that could give investors a better long-term return. But investors who choose to hold onto their Tesla stock should keep in mind the risks, keeping a close eye on self-driving technology developments and Robotaxi's economics as it scales.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Burry calls Tesla ’ridiculously overvalued’ but avoids shorting ’dangerous’ stock\n\nLuke Juricic\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:23 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nInvesting.com -- Michael Burry, the contrarian investor famous for his \"Big Short\" bet against the 2008 housing bubble, clarified on Wednesday that he does not currently hold a short position in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), even as the electric vehicle maker braces for a challenging end to 2025.\n\nResponding to a direct inquiry on social media platform X, Burry stated, \"I am not short.\" The clarification comes just a day after Burry used his Substack to deliver a scathing critique of the company’s valuation following a series of disappointing internal updates from the Austin-based carmaker.\n\"Ridiculously Overvalued\" but Dangerous to Short On Tuesday, Burry described Tesla as a \"ridiculously overvalued stock,\" noting that while the fundamentals may be deteriorating, the technicals make it a \"short’s graveyard.\"\n\"Shorting it has been dangerous, and the puts are expensive,\" Burry wrote on his subscription-based research platform. \"So maybe not much to do here for most people, except sell it if they can.\"\n\nBurry’s decision to stay on the sidelines regarding Tesla is notable given his active bearish bets elsewhere. Earlier this year, Burry has revealed significant put positions on AI darlings NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PLTR), comparing the current AI boom to the 2000 dot-com bubble and warning that a massive \"earnings correction\" is looming for the 2026 market.\nTesla Issues Rare \"Warning\" via Consensus Data The renewed scrutiny of Tesla’s valuation follows an unusual move by the company on Monday. For the first time, Tesla officially published a company-compiled consensus of analyst estimates on its Investor Relations website, a move widely interpreted as an attempt to manage expectations for a weak fourth quarter.\n\nThe data reveals a somber outlook:\nQ4 Delivery Consensus: Analysts expect 422,850 vehicles, a 15% decline compared to the same period last year.\nAnnual Decline: Tesla is on track for its second consecutive annual sales drop, with full-year 2025 deliveries estimated at 1.64 million, down from 1.79 million in 2024.\nThe gloomy guidance reflects a \"delivery hangover\" after a massive surge in Q3, which was driven by U.S. consumers rushing to buy vehicles before federal tax credits expired on September 30.\nTesla stock was down 0.4% in late morning trade on Wednesday.\nRelated articles\nBurry calls Tesla ’ridiculously overvalued’ but avoids shorting ’dangerous’ stock\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "World's 500 Richest Reach $11.9 Trillion After Record $2.2 Trillion Gain\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nORCL\n\nGOOG\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBloomberg data indicate that the world's 500 richest individuals added a record $2.2 trillion to their collective wealth this year, lifting combined net worth to $11.9 trillion as gains across equities, cryptocurrencies and precious metals supported asset values. The expansion in wealth was supported following Donald Trump's election victory in late 2024, though momentum was briefly interrupted in April when tariff concerns triggered the largest one-day wealth decline since the pandemic. Bloomberg's analysis suggests Big Tech remained a central driver, with ongoing artificial-intelligence optimism supporting US mega-cap stocks and concentrating roughly a quarter of total gains among eight individuals, including Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) chief executive Elon Musk, Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) chairman Larry Ellison, Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) co-founder Larry Page and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, although that contribution was smaller than the year prior.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs ORCL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nBloomberg's wealth index shows Musk began the year as the most prominent figure among global billionaires, though his net worth appeared volatile as political involvement and time spent in Washington coincided with pressure on Tesla shares before a later rebound. The data highlight Ellison as a standout beneficiary of increased AI-related spending, briefly overtaking Musk in September following a sharp rise in Oracle shares linked to its cloud and AI infrastructure investments, even though the stock later retreated roughly 40% from its peak. Outside the United States, Bloomberg data show that wealth gains were broad-based, with the UK's FTSE 100 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng outperforming the S&P 500 through Dec. 30, while strong demand for safe-haven assets supported precious metals and boosted fortunes tied to copper and rare earths amid rising geopolitical significance.\n\nOther asset classes produced more uneven outcomes during the year. Bloomberg data show Bitcoin surged to record highs following Trump's election and the rollout of crypto-friendly policies, before a sharp selloff beginning in October erased those gains and weighed on crypto-focused billionaires including Michael Saylor. The index also highlights sharp reversals tied to company-specific events, including significant losses for property tycoon Manuel Villar after a collapse in Golden MV Holdings shares, and for Venture Global co-founders Bob Pender and Mike Sabel following a scaled-back IPO and subsequent stock decline. In China, Bloomberg data indicate Meituan co-founder Wang Xing saw his wealth fall as weakening domestic demand and intensifying competition offset a strong year for broader Chinese equity benchmarks, underscoring how market momentum in 2025 could be powerful but uneven across sectors and regions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nBurry, best known for his bets against the U.S. housing market ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, responded I am not short when asked whether he was betting against Tesla, according to the post.\nTesla stock was unchanged in recent trading.\nThe comments drew attention because Burry has recently questioned valuations across parts of the technology and artificial intelligence sector. He has also closed his hedge fund and launched a subscription-based research platform.\nRegulatory filings earlier showed Burry held put options on Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR), positions that would benefit if those shares fall by 2027, according to media reports.\nBurry has previously criticized Tesla's valuation and raised concerns about shareholder dilution from equity issuance and executive compensation.\nTesla recently released preliminary delivery expectations, suggesting fourth-quarter vehicle sales may come in below some analyst forecasts. The company is scheduled to report official delivery figures in early January.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

When asked directly whether he would short the shares at current levels, Burry responded, I am not short, following comments a day earlier in which he described the stock as ridiculously overvalued.\n\nWarning!

In recent commentary, Burry has questioned valuations across major artificial intelligence-linked names and raised concerns about the accounting practices of hyperscalers, reflecting a more cautious view toward segments of the market that have driven recent equity performance.\nWhile Tesla is not part of his bearish positioning at this stage, Burry has disclosed downside exposure elsewhere. At the start of November, he revealed put positions on Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Palantir ( NASDAQ:PLTR ), according to The Wall Street Journal, with the Nvidia trade structured to pay off if the stock falls to $110 by 2027 and the Palantir position benefiting if shares decline to $50 in 2027.\n\nCGU et Politique de confidentialité\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Mark Zuckerberg Threw $77 Billion 'Into The Toilet' On Metaverse, Says Economist Dean Baker: Asks If He Is Set To Waste Billions More On AI\n\nVishaal Sanjay\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTSLA\n\nEconomist Dean Baker criticized Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg's massive bet on the Metaverse, arguing the roughly $77 billion spent on the project represents not just a corporate loss, but a broader economic failure that carries real social costs.\nZuckerberg Threw $77 Billion In his newsletter on Monday titled “Did Mark Zuckerberg Throw $77 Billion of Our Money into the Toilet?” Baker said that while Meta's Metaverse ambitions could be viewed as “just a mistaken investment decision, of the sort companies make all the time,” the scale of the spending made it far more consequential.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nHe said that when Zuckerberg invested $77 billion into Meta's virtual reality push, he effectively diverted scarce talent and physical resources away from more productive uses.\n“The flip side to this story is that when companies make stupid investment decisions, as it seems Zuckerberg did with the $77 billion he threw into Meta, it is not just a loss on their books, but also a cost to society,” he said.\nHe noted that software engineers, planners and support staff were tied up in the project for years, alongside physical inputs such as office space, computing equipment and large amounts of electricity.\n\nBaker, who co-founded the Center for Economic and Policy Research, added that these same resources “could have otherwise been productively employed,” suggesting even the construction materials used for Meta's expansion could have instead supported “affordable housing in the expensive Bay Area.”\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nBaker said the failed Metaverse bet becomes especially relevant as major technology firms now pour hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence.\nHe warned that the AI investment boom is already reshaping the economy, fueling growth by absorbing top engineering talent while simultaneously placing heavy strain on power grids and complicating climate goals.\n\nThe central question, Baker concluded, is whether Zuckerberg has become a more disciplined steward of capital since the Metaverse era. “We are likely to learn the answer in 2026.”\nMeta did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for a comment on this. The story will be updated as soon as we receive a response.\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

      "Content": "DHL’s Tesla Semi Pilot ‘Exceeded Expectations,’ Paving Way for Expansion\n\nGlenn Taylor\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:06 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: DHLGY\n\nTSLA\n\nDHL Supply Chain unveiled its first Tesla Semi truck earlier this month, a year after completing its first successful pilot, as the contract logistics provider continues to scale its North American electric vehicle fleet.\nThe company says it now operates more than 150 heavy-duty Class 8 electric vehicles across the continent, plans to add more semis in 2026 as Tesla begins its volume production.\n\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nDHL, CMA CGM Partner to Cut Ocean Freight Emissions With Biofuels\nFedEx Lifts Outlook Despite $175M Headwinds From MD-11 Grounding\nEnglish Language Proficiency Crackdown Sidelines 9,500 Truckers, DOT Says\nStephan Schablinski, vice president of GoGreen North America at DHL Supply Chain, told Transport Topics that more deliveries are expected to begin from next year’s second half onward. Schablinski said DHL wants to operate the Semi tractors in other states beyond California, including Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nAccording to the company, 30 percent of DHL’s medium- and heavy-duty trucking fleet is expected to be battery-electric or powered by another zero-emissions technology by 2030.\nThe Tesla Semi pilot took place in Livermore, Calif. over two weeks in October 2026, where the all-electric truck covered over 3,000 miles of regular routes. The trial included one long haul of 390 miles, and was fully loaded with a gross combined weight of 75,000 pounds.\n\n“Our pilot of the Tesla Semi exceeded expectations, proving its ability to efficiently haul a typical DHL freight over long distances on a single charge,” said Jim Monkmeyer, president of transportation, DHL Supply Chain North America, in a statement. “Integrating the Tesla Semi into our fleet is an important step toward achieving our decarbonization goals and delivering more sustainable solutions for our customers.”\nAccording to Tesla, the Semi can travel up to 500 miles on a single charge, and can recover up to 70 percent of range in 30 minutes. Class 8 trucks typically have a range of less than 250 miles on one charge.\nDan Priestley, director of Semi at Tesla, said the DHL partnership will “help us make the product even better for future global markets.” Tesla says the start of serial production of the Semi remains on schedule for late 2025 with a ramp up to capacity in 2026.\n\nThe truck currently travels approximately 100 miles per day in central California, DHL says, and requires charging about once per week. Additionally, it is projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 metric tons annually.\nWith the Tesla Semi within its fleet, DHL can further accelerate its transition to net zero-emission logistics , a call the logistics giant aims to reach by 2050. On a shorter-term basis, the company is also pushing to reduce absolute carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from 40 million metric tons to 29 million in 2030 to stay aligned with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requirements.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is one of multiple companies that DHL has worked with for electric trucking adoption since 2020, with the company teaming up with BYD, Volvo Trucks , Daimler Truck, Scania and now-defunct Nikola on separate deployments. DHL Supply Chain also owns and operates more than 50 Orange EV yard trucks that are deployed at 30 sites across the country to move trailers and shipping containers.\n\nThe Livermore facility does not have any other battery-electric trucks other than the Tesla Semi, according to Schablinski.\nBeyond the long haul, EVs have been a priority for DHL’s wider last-mile delivery ambitions.\nAs of October, DHL said it has 39,000 total EVs worldwide in pickup and delivery services, representing more than 41 percent of pickup and delivery vehicles. The company aims to increase this share to 66 percent in 2030.\nDecarbonization at the logistics giant also extends to its air cargo operation, which accounts for 68 percent of DHL’s emissions. DHL has already used 188,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) between 2020 and 2024 and will double that figure this year. SAF now makes up 3.5 percent of the company’s total jet fuel mix, with the firm aiming to escalate this number to 30 percent by 2030.\n\nDHL’s sustainability push recently pushed into ocean freight. This month, DHL partnered with ocean carrier CMA CGM to decarbonize container shipping , with the logistics companies committing to use 8,900 metric tons of a lower-carbon biofuel for ocean shipments.\nUnder that initiative, DHL and CMA CGM expect to slash roughly 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for ocean freight shipped through DHL’s GoGreen Plus and CMA CGM’s ACT+ programs.\nThose programs are designed to let customers pay a premium price to select more sustainable fuel options for their shipments.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Tesla Stock Dipped on Monday\n\nEric Volkman, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 5:19 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nKey Points A partner's regulatory disclosure indicates that a battery component supply deal would be far smaller than originally expected.\nThat supplier is based in South Korea and provides material for a relatively inexpensive Tesla battery.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nThe final stock-trading Monday of 2025 was not kind to Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares. The bellwether electric vehicle (EV) company saw its stock price sag 3.3% that day, on the back of news that a key supplier would be supplying far fewer goods than originally anticipated. The stock dropped a bit more on Tuesday.\n\nHitting the brakes hard That supplier is a South Korean company, L&F, which, according to numerous news outlets, disclosed this development in a regulatory filing. The company stated that the total value of a deal to provide high-nickel cathode materials, for use in Tesla's battery cells, now stands at $7,386. That's quite a far distance down from the previous estimate of $2.9 billion.\nTesla and L&F originally signed their supply deal in 2023, with the term stretching from January 2024 through December 2025.\nCheck engine light In the filing, L&F did not state any reasons for the drastic cut in the value of the Tesla deal. The materials in question are apparently used in the American company's 4680 battery cells. These are comparatively inexpensive to manufacture, which, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, would give the company the scope to manufacture a small EV priced at a relatively inexpensive $25,000.\n\nThe 4680 is also used in the company's Cybertruck . Despite Musk's enthusiasm for the futuristic-looking car, its sales have been disappointing.\nWhatever the cause(s) of the steep decline in the L&F deal, it certainly isn't a great sign for Tesla. The company has struggled with the slowing growth of EV sales overall, and a model like the Cybertruck -- an acquired taste, at best -- isn't helping matters.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Tesla Ratio Spread Targets A Profit Zone Between 410 and 430\n\nGavin McMaster\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nA put ratio spread is an advanced option trade and generally not suitable for beginners, but it can have its place within an option portfolio.\nIt is generally considered a neutral strategy, although it has the ability to make a profit in up, down and sideways markets.\nMore News from Barchart Apple is an Analyst Favorite, But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best Play\nAltria’s (MO) Unusual Options Activity Just Tipped Its Hand to a Hidden Multi-Dimensional Opportunity\nSilver Linings Playbook: How to Speculate Safely, Even on Record-High Silver Prices\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nYes, it can make money no matter which way the market goes, the key is the timing!\nThe strategy involves buying a number of put options and selling more put options further out-of-the-money.\nThe trade is placed when the trader thinks the underlying stock will be stable or slowly move lower and finish around the short put strike at expiry.\nA fall in implied volatility will benefit the trade and it can also be profitable if the stock moves up early in the trade.\nThe big risk with the trade is a sharp move lower early in the trade.\nLet’s look at an example using Tesla (TSLA).\nTesla Ratio Spread Example\nBuying the January 16 put with a strike price of $430 for around $6.55 and selling 2 of the January 16, 420-strike puts for around $4.45 would create a put ratio spread.\n\nAs we are selling 2 contracts at $4.45 the trade results in a net credit of $2.35 which is $235 premium.\nThis is the maximum gain above a stock price of $430. Basically, all the puts would expire worthless and the trader keeps the $235 premium.\nA tent-shaped profit zone exists between $410 and $430 with the maximum gain occurring at $420 and is around $1,250.\nThis is what the trade looks like as of today:\nYou can see the main risk in the trade is a drop in price early on. The blue line is the profit and loss at expiration and the purple line is the T+0 line. T+0 just means “today”.\nSo, we don’t want the stock to get into the profit tent too early.\nWhat about in ten days’ time? How does the trade look then?\nLooking a lot better for any price above $430.\nOne advantage of this trade type is it takes advantage of option skew. Notice the contract we are buying has lower volatility (43.86%) than the contract we are selling (42.70%). Buy low, sell high.\nNot that the trade starts with a delta of 10, which means the initial position is roughly equivalent to being long 10 shares of TSLA stock, although this will change as the trade progresses.\n\nStory Continues\nCompany Details\nTesla designs, develops, manufactures, sells and leases high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to their products.\nThey generally sell their products directly to customers and continue to grow their customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers.\n\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion rating is an 88% Buy with a Weakening short term outlook on maintaining the current direction.\nLong term indicators fully support a continuation of the trend.\nRelative Strength just crossed below 50%. The market is indicating support for a bearish trend.\nSummary\nThis strategy should move fairly slowly, unless there is a sharp drop in the stock price.\nAs the trade involves naked options, it is not recommended for beginners.\nYou can do this on other stocks as well, but remember to start small until you understand a bit more about how this all works.\nMitigating Risk\nWith any option trade, it’s important to have a plan in place on how you will manage the trade if it moves against you.\nA stop loss of $400 might make sense in this scenario. If Tesla is below $420 near expiry, there will be assignment risk.\n\nIf you have questions on this strategy, please let me know.\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\nThis article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

      "Content": "Tesla Supplier L&F Restates $2.9 Billion Contract to $7,386\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:54 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nTesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) once played a central role in elevating South Korean battery-materials producer L&F into the global EV supply-chain spotlight, after a 2023 order initially valued at $2.9 billion drove a sharp rally in the company's shares. That agreement, however, has now been materially revised, with L&F disclosing that the contract value was restated to just $7,386, representing a 99% reduction. The adjustment comes after L&F shares had already fallen more than 70% from their 2023 peak, and it coincides with a notable decline in the personal wealth of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hur Jae-hong and his family, whose listed holdings have dropped from more than $800 million at their high to roughly $134 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe original Tesla order was linked to cathodes intended for certain Cybertruck models, but volumes appear to have diminished as the vehicle faced repeated delays and demand proved softer than initially expected. The stock had already been trending lower amid a broader cooling in global EV demand and rising investor concerns over L&F's dependence on LG Energy Solution, which accounts for about 80% of total sales. Analysts at KB Securities said L&F had likely not been supplying Tesla with any cathodes since last year, noting that the contract had already been excluded from earnings forecasts, which suggests the disclosure's impact on future performance could be extremely limited. They added that L&F's indirect supply to Tesla via LG Energy Solution, supporting high-volume models such as the Model Y, appears to be progressing smoothly regardless of the latest filing.\n\nEven so, the inability to monetize the 2023 Tesla contract represents a setback for L&F's longer-term diversification strategy. A partnership signed in 2021 with US battery recycling company Redwood Materials, followed by the Tesla deal, had been viewed as a pathway to reduce reliance on LG Energy Solution to 50% by 2025, a target that now faces renewed scrutiny. Looking ahead, some analysts see potential recovery drivers emerging, with L&F scheduled to begin full-scale production for Rivian Automotive in 2026 and continuing to supply mid-nickel cathodes to SK On for Hyundai Motor EV batteries. While near-term investor sentiment could remain pressured, there is an increasing possibility that attention may return to the sector in 2026, potentially centered on demand for energy storage systems tied to AI data centers.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla Publishes Delivery Estimates Signaling Lower Sales Outlook\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:52 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nTesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) has taken an unusual step by publicly releasing its own compilation of delivery estimates, a move that may be signaling a more cautious outlook for near-term vehicle sales. The company published figures showing analysts on average expect fourth-quarter deliveries of 422,850 vehicles, down 15% from a year earlier. That compares with a Bloomberg-compiled average of 440,907 vehicles, an 11% annual decline. While Tesla's investor relations team has long shared such estimates privately with analysts, the company has not previously published them on its website, suggesting an effort to push a more conservative consensus into the open.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe estimates point to Tesla potentially recording a second consecutive annual drop in vehicle deliveries. The company's own compiled average calls for about 1.6 million deliveries this year, down more than 8% from the prior year, and its projections for the following three years also sit below Bloomberg's averages. Tesla's shares fell as much as 1.3% on Tuesday before recovering those losses, indicating initial investor caution that did not fully carry through the session.\nTesla's sales were pressured earlier in the year as the company retooled production lines across all assembly plants for the redesigned Model Y, its best-selling vehicle, a period that also coincided with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk playing a polarizing role in the Trump administration. Deliveries later climbed to a record in the third quarter as US consumers rushed to purchase electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of $7,500 federal tax credits at the end of September. Tesla has since moved to partially offset the loss of those incentives by introducing lower-priced versions of the Model Y and Model 3 priced below $40,000, and the shares remain up about 14% through Monday's close, trailing the S&P 500 Index's 17% gain.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But I think the the the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So, you know, a lot of people should be actually reallocating now. Maybe not today, you know, on a few of the last trading days in the uh in the sessions here, but, you know, from a tax consequence standpoint. But I think, you know, you have an opportunity in the forward, you know, months coming forward here in 2024, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think I think the the point is is that you should. Don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n00:54 Speaker A\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n00:58 Speaker B\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, one out of every 10 years that you know, they've outperformed and we get seven out of 10 on the uh broader markets of out performance. So I like to stay US. So, you know, my thought is is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2024, but, you know, the dollar may, you know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cost average in, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just uh hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on the year ahead too.\nPowered by the artificial intelligence trade once again, the 2025 financial markets story might seem, on the surface, to be a rerun of what investors lived through in 2023 and 2024.\n\nShine a bit of light on the subject, however, and we see the inner workings of the market's path in 2025 spun an eventful story that won't soon be forgotten.\nDonald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president.\nThe largest company in the world lost nearly 20% of its value in a single day.\nThe S&P 500 registered its worst week since the COVID crash of 2020, crashing 10% in just two days.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%.\nGold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year in two generations. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory Continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

      "Content": "These Stocks Are the Market’s Biggest Winners and Losers in 2025\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nUpdated Wed, December 31, 2025 at 3:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nLULU\n\nTSLA\n\nCOIN\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index is poised to end 2025 up more than 17% as the bull market continues for a third year driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.\nThe AI trade broadened out this year, as chip stocks again led the S&P 500 but were joined by the shares of companies tied to building the data centers that will power the technology. Three of the index’s top 10 performers in 2025 were data storage companies, which are among the main beneficiaries of the hundreds of billions of dollars in pledged spending by the giant AI cloud service providers known as hyperscalers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nOn the flip side, economic uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs weighed on the shares of consumer companies, while health-care stocks struggled with uncertainty surrounding the administration’s policies and pressure on drug prices.\nHere are some of the biggest winners and losers in the US stock market this year.\n\nWinner: New AI Leadership Technology stocks, especially those tied to AI, again dominated the market. But leadership shifted to the shares of companies associated with data — from storage to the building, heating and cooling of data centers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ) Corp., Amazon.com ( AMZN ) Inc., Alphabet ( GOOG ) Inc. and Meta Platforms ( META ) Inc. have pledged to spend more than $440 billion over the next 12 months to build out AI capabilities, benefiting firms such as Sandisk ( SNDK ) Corp., Western Digital ( WDC ) Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc ( STX ), which were three of the four best performing stocks in the S&P 500.\nWinner: New S&P 500 Additions A slew of companies were added to the S&P 500 in 2025, including Robinhood ( HOOD ) Markets Inc., Sandisk, AppLovin ( APP ) Corp. and Carvana ( CVNA ) Co., all of which posted triple-digit percentage gains and landed among the top 20 performers in the index.\nOf course, not every stock that joined the S&P 500 got a boost. Trade Desk ( TTD ) Inc. shares were the worst performers in the index with a nearly 70% loss, while Block ( XYZ ) Inc. tumbled more than 20% and Coinbase ( COIN ) Global Inc. sank more than 6%.\n\nWinner: Palantir Palantir ( PLTR ) Technologies Inc. shares are set to notch a triple-digit gain for the third year in a row. The software developer got a boost from AI enthusiasm and strong buy-in from retail traders who are drawn to the company’s outspoken Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp.\n\nBut the stock is now rather pricey. With a multiple of more than 180 times forward earnings, it’s the third most expensive member of the S&P 500 behind Tesla Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWinner: Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ) soared almost 175% in 2025 on the strength of takeover speculation. The company formally put itself up for sale in October, and there’s an ongoing battle between the top two bidders, Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) Corp. and Netflix ( NFLX ) Inc., with both suitors jockeying to strengthen financial backing for their offers.\nThe Warner Bros. board prefers the Netflix bid and is reportedly planning to reject Paramount’s offer, but Larry Ellison, the billionaire chairman of Oracle Corp. and father of Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison, is personally guaranteeing the Paramount proposal.\nLoser: Consumer Staples Economic uncertainty, tariffs and concerns about the health of the US consumer as inflation creeps higher weighed on consumer stocks, especially some major staples names. Clorox ( CLX ) Co., frozen french fries maker Lamb Weston ( LW ) Holdings Inc., Campbell’s ( CPB ) Co. and beverage giant Constellation Brands ( STZ ) Inc. were among the 20 worst-performers in the S&P 500. Shares of fast-casual dining brand Chipotle ( CMG ) Mexican Grill Inc. sank nearly 40% after two years of double-digit gains.\n\nLoser: Retail The same economic uncertainty also hit shares of some retail companies. Deckers ( DECK ) Outdoor Corp., which owns brands such as Hoka and Ugg, was down almost 50% in 2025, snapping a nine-year streak of gains. The stock was hit hard by a few weak earnings forecasts and analyst downgrades.\nLululemon ( LULU ) Athletica Inc. shares are set to fall nearly 45% this year, their second consecutive double-digit annual decline, as the athletic apparel retailer struggles through an overhaul after a period of slow growth and the recent exit of its chief executive officer. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in the company.\n\nLoser: Managed Care Health insurance stocks underperformed in 2025 despite hopes that the group would benefit from a shift in policy by the Trump administration. Molina ( MOH ) Healthcare Inc. shares were down more than 40%, their second straight year of double-digit declines. UnitedHealth ( UNH ) Group Inc. and Centene ( CNC ) Corp. have both shed more than 30%, putting them among the 25 worst performers in the S&P 500.\nStill, there are signs of hope for the group as some investors view the beaten-down valuations as attractive, making the stocks possibly due for a rebond. Money manager Michael Burry has said he’s long Molina shares and that he views the company as acquisition target in 2026 if it remains this cheap.\n\n—With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The crowd went wild with cheers.\nThe Information Office of the People's Government of Hangzhou Binjiang District stated that this epic few-minute show says it all: Binjiang's killing it by mixing tech innovation and industrial growth. On this 72-square-kilometer spot south of the Qiantang River, smart humanoid robots are leveling up, China's \"new three cultural exports\" (online literature, web dramas, games) are winning global fans, and talented folks are flocking in, all creating more and more \"impressive\" moments from Binjiang.\n\nEmbodied Intelligence Robotics Walking from Lab to Real Life\nUnitree's dancing robots aren't just for show - they're a sneak peek at Binjiang's booming AI scene.\n\"Those easy-looking moves? They're all about motors, movement programs, and mechanical parts working in perfect harmony,\" said Unitree CEO Wang Xingxing. His team spent three years cracking key tech, making the robots' joints super flexible and quick. Today, these multi-talented bots aren't just entertainers: their tech is used in factories, elderly care, and more. Plus, their self-made motors and speed reducers broke foreign companies' hold on the market.\nBinjiang is full of such tech wins. Deep Principle's AI system tripled warehouse robots' sorting speed, and Supcon's co-developed AI traffic bots are now on Binjiang's streets, directing traffic smoothly and politely reminding rule-breakers. Home to over 200 big AI and software firms, Binjiang has a complete industry chain covering from AI chips to real-world apps. Its embodied artificial intelligence robotics town houses over 100 related companies, and a test base turns lab ideas into real products in no time.\n\nIn the first three quarters of this year, Binjiang's industrial output jumped 11.3% - double-digit growth for three straight quarters - thanks mostly to its AI superstars.\nCultural Exports Help Make Chinese Stories Go Global\nIf smart robots are Binjiang's \"muscle,\" its \"new three cultural exports\" are its \"harm offensive.\"\n\nStory Continues\nAt NetEase Games, Naraka: Bladepoint blends traditional Chinese beauty with in-house tech, featuring dynamic bamboo forest light and realistic martial arts moves. The game has sold more 20 million copies worldwide, and millions of foreign players are learning moves and geeking out over its architecture online. Eastern martial arts culture is spreading like wildfire, all via digital magic.\n\nLegend of Zanghai (adapted from an online novel), developed by Hangzhou Nanpai Investment Management Co., Ltd., was leased in 190 countries, topping charts in 23. Traditional crafts like mortise-and-tenon joints and shadow puppetry had overseas audiences hooked. \"Cultural exports are all about connecting through feelings. We tell Chinese stories the Eastern way,\" said a company spokesperson.\nBehind these hits is China Internet Writers Village: 325 famous writers live here, and more than 300 popular works become movies, games, and more via the fast-tracking process for IP development and transfer, reaching 160 million-plus overseas readers.\nBinjiang's got their backs with a 500-million-yuan fund and cultural creative incentives to fix funding troubles for small creative companies. In the first half of this year, its cultural exports raked in 52.35 billion yuan in revenue and 550 million U.S. dollars in exports, the highest in Hangzhou, according to the Information Office of the People's Government of Hangzhou Binjiang District.\n\nTalent Magnet Enables Dream Chase without Stress\nBinjiang's success boils down to one thing: people. With an average age of just 33.5, this place has over 500,000 talents, contributing 3% of Zhejiang's total talent with less than 0.1% of its land.\nBinjiang's talent perks are unbeatable: up to 20 million yuan in startup cash for top overseas talents, 1,100-plus talent projects (spawning 9 listed firms) in 16 years, and this year's policy upgrade boosted funding from 100 million to 1 billion yuan.\nWork-life balance is widely available in Binjiang. On-site kindergartens match work hours with dinner and after-school care, and senior day care centers take care of elderly family members. Plus, \"neighbors are business partners\" leads to no need to travel far for industrial collaborations. With supportive hefty investments in computing power and data, local talents can focus whole-heartedly on chasing their dreams.\n\nNajing Science and Technology's CEO Gong Yongxing knows this firsthand: his company got tens of millions in support, and the government fixed his team's kids' school enrollment. \"Here, we can pour all our energy into innovation and research with no distractions,\" he said.\nFrom Unitree's robots flipping globally to Naraka wowing overseas gamers, to talents' dreams blooming, Binjiang is showing the world endless possibilities of new-quality productive forces. Musk's \"Impressive\" comment isn't just for a robot team - it's a standing ovation for Binjiang's awesome story of innovation, teamwork, and breaking limits.\nSource: The Information Office of the People's Government of Hangzhou Binjiang District\nCONTACT: Ms. Li Tel: 86-10-63074558\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Tesla IPO'd in 2010 and has grown 28,500% since going public. Trading volume reached 58 million shares, which is very close to its three-month average.\n\nTuesday’s catalysts centered on Tesla’s company-compiled Q4 delivery consensus, analyst downgrades, and reports of a scaled-back battery deal.\n\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.13% to 6,896, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 0.24% to 23,419. Among industry peers, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) fell 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively, as investors weighed shifting EV strategies and broader uncertainty across the sector.\n\nWhat this means for investors On Tuesday morning, Tesla provided guidance that it would deliver 422,850 vehicles in the fourth quarter. This was well shy of a recent survey's analyst average of 445,000 and represents a 15% decline from Q4 2024. This prompted a downgrade to equal-weight by one prominent Wall Street firm, helping spur today's decline.\n\nThe underwhelming figures come just one day after a key supplier erased the majority of a massive EV battery deal with Tesla, sparking concerns that its Cybertruck sales may continue to disappoint. Trading with a market cap of $1.5 trillion -- and at a lofty 17 times sales -- Tesla may need to stick the landing on its pivot to autonomous vehicles, AI, and robotics, to live up to its hefty valuation.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The stock has gained 10.00% in the past five days. Trading volume reached 77.5 million shares, coming in about 32% above versus its three-month average of 52.4 million shares.\nTuesday’s trading featured stronger fourth-quarter sales projections and China’s extended EV trade-in subsidies. Nio IPO'd in 2018 and has fallen 16% since going public.\n\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.14% to 6,896, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 0.24% to 23,419. Auto manufacturers peers were mixed as investors compared Nio’s stronger Q4 outlook with ongoing competition in premium EVs. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell by 1.13% and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) gained 0.64%.\n\nWhat this means for investors Nio extended its upward streak today as investors reacted to positive sales projections and a Chinese government policy change. Chinese officials announced an extension to trade-in subsidies for electric vehicles. According to Sherwood News, the shift in policy will give consumers up to $2,850 towards a qualifying new vehicle, boosting demand.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO William Li told Chinese media that the company's Q4 vehicle sales will come in above 30 billion yuan (around $4.3 billion). This reassured the market after Nio's Q3 revenue disappointed. The upbeat sales figures come against a backdrop of chip shortages, which are impacting delivery of its new ES8 SUV orders.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports on what the automaker is expecting to report.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nand Tesla is doing something it almost never does. It's previewing its own fourth quarter deliveries release and lowering expectations, signaling a sharper year-over-year decline than many on Wall Street expected. Joining me for more is a Yahoo Finance senior auto reporter, Prassy Ranan. So Prass, break this all down for us. Why did they decide to release it and what do you make of the early release?\n00:23 Pras Subramanian\nWell, there's no real reason that we know, right? It's really unusual putting this out. Basically they they did their own Wall Street consensus estimates. They pulled, you know, using different uh analyst estimates there and they said that they claim consensus is at 40 400 423,000 units globally. I forgot the thousand there. representing a 15% drop year-over-year, right? Uh now that's below Bloomberg's own 445,000 uh delivery estimate. So it's significantly lower there.\n01:03 Pras Subramanian\nUh for the year consensus assessment, Tesla says 1.64 million deliveries, an 8% drop compared to a year ago and the second straight year of declines year over year for Tesla. So, you know, what's going on here? You know, why would you release these estimates, right? Some people think that they're trying to cushion the blow of a really bad Q4 report. You know, we had the loss of tax credit affecting sales and maybe it's worse than we thought. So that's probably what's going on here maybe.\n01:31 Pras Subramanian\nUh but for the stock, it doesn't matter, right? Declining sales don't matter. Stock is up, you know, a little bit down today, but up for the year. It's all about AI and Robo taxis.\n01:40 Speaker A\nYeah, and back in September, we saw the cost of a vehicle jump up because of that expiration of the EV tax credit. More and more people are trying to get their electric vehicles before the tax credit expired.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports on what lies ahead for Waymo.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nLet's talk about robotaxis because you think that 2026 could actually be a big year for one of Tesla's biggest competitors and that's Google's Waymo. So break down why is 2026 going to be such a big year?\n00:10 Pras\nYou know, starting off anecdotally, right? I was just in Austin, Texas for the for the holidays and they are everywhere. Waymos are everywhere, dropping people off, picking people up.\n00:20 Speaker A\nPeople are using them. It's easy.\n00:21 Pras\nYeah, I must have seen about 100 and I saw one Tesla robotaxi, right?\n00:25 Speaker A\nOh wow.\n00:25 Pras\nNow, now that's that's because\n00:26 Speaker A\n100 though. That's that's unlike what you're seeing here in the northeast.\n00:29 Pras\nWell, well not yet, right? Um so so then and then they've been in LA. I was in LA this past summer, they're all over LA. So they've really grown in the spots that they're actually operating, which is San Francisco, Phoenix, LA, Austin, and Atlanta, right? They're operating these areas without safety drivers. completely. there's no one in the car. It's just an empty car driving around. So, they're actually doing it and they're and they're charging for it, right? Uh they're going to in 2026 they're going to expand to Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Orlando with full service expected in the early 2026, and they're testing in Detroit, DC, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis.\n01:05 Pras\neven New York City, London and Tokyo, they're testing there. We'll see if that happens. But you know, very deep deeply populated urban areas that's really tough for excuse me robotaxis. So, that's happening.\n01:18 Pras\nNow, by the numbers. Uh right at the end of this year, Waymo was at 250,000 trips a week, right?\n01:24 Speaker A\nWow.\n01:25 Pras\nThey want to do an and sorry, and 20 million for the entire time they've been operating. They want to do million rides a week now by the end of the year.\n01:31 Speaker A\nNow and is this doable. Do you think they can do it?\n01:32 Pras\nSo at the end of next year. So that's four times.\n01:34 Pras\nI mean if if the if the deployments go well. Uh now you mentioned, can they do it? That's a good question because they have to increase production on their cars. They're building their their their EVs with the Jaguar I-PACE and the a Zeekr, Chinese model. But that costs money. And they don't have Tesla's ability to just crank out cars, right? So that's a potential headwind. Uh secondly, what about regulations and safety? Uh you know, sometimes some many municipalities don't want to have that. Or you have a big sort of safety issue like like Cruise did in San Francisco and that just knocks them out of the game. So those are some of the headwinds that they're facing. But\n02:04 Pras\nthat aside, 2026 could be a big year for them.\n02:07 Speaker A\nYeah, and you did mention your story that's now on Yahoo Finance's site that Tesla operates its ridehailing service with safety occupants still. And they're and only in Austin and San Francisco and that's since mid 2025. So it seems like even though there was so much excitement especially around June for Tesla's robotaxis, it seems like they're behind the game compared to Google's Waymo.\n02:24 Pras\nYeah, yeah, I mean and and the number of vehicles is actually pretty low too, right, compared to what Waymo is doing. They now Tesla says they're going to expand to to Las Vegas. I'm sorry, I'm sorry Nevada and then also Phoenix. That's the next the next spots for them. Um and then people like Ives think that's going to be 30 more markets by end of next year. I think that's overly optimistic because we haven't even heard what the next markets are. They haven't even pulled a safe driver out of the in Austin and San Francisco yet. So, a lot of big ifs there, but of course that's the sort of the big payoff if they actually do it.\n02:47 Speaker A\nRight. Wedbush's Dan Ives always bullish on Tesla, though.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) Cybertruck amid poor sales .\n‘I'm Keeping It For Now,' Ross Gerber Says On Sunday, a user on the social media platform X, Miss Jilianne , shared a post criticizing the EV giant's all-electric pickup truck. She claimed that almost every \"Tesla influencer\" returned the Cybertruck \"due to mechanical issues\" with the vehicle. She did not elaborate on what the issues were in the post.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nResponding to the post, Gerber shared that he would be holding on to his Cybertruck. \"I have not had any issues with my Cybertruck,\" the investor shared, adding that he would be \"keeping it for now\" as he likes it.\nTesla Cybertruck's Poor Run Tesla, in Q3 2025, sold just 5,385 Cybertruck units in the U.S., which illustrated a 62.6% YoY decline for the pickup truck. The EV giant is also reportedly sitting on tens of thousands of unsold units of the truck, with the affordable RWD Long-Range version of the pickup doing little to improve sales figures. Gerber had also called on Tesla to discontinue the vehicle altogether.\n\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nRoss Gerber's FSD Woes Gerber, on the other hand, also recently shared his experience with Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, saying that the technology wouldn't work well in the rain with its vision-based approach, as it mistook raindrops for debris on the FSD camera. \"Not sure of teslas plans if FSD doesn't work well in rain or direct sunlight…\" Gerber said.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the investor had earlier hailed the improvements made by Tesla to the FSD system with the FSD v14 update. \"This version is a big step up from 13 which was not good,\" he said of the v14 update. However, Tesla's poor sales have drawn concern from Gerber, who thinks that the company may never make GAAP profits ever again.\n\nStory Continues\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

      "Content": "Why Lucid Could Continue to Set Record Quarters but Disappoint Investors\n\nDaniel Miller, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 12:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LCID\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points An early investment in Tesla would have proven wildly lucrative today.\nLucid has set seven consecutive quarterly records for deliveries.\nWith the Gravity base trim on the way, it should further boost demand for the vehicle.\n10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›\nIf you bought $10,000 of Tesla stock the day it went public , you'd have roughly $2.9 million right now. That's in a different world compared to the same investment in the broader S&P 500 that would be worth only about $66,000. While Tesla is one of a kind, it's that opportunity and those potential returns that have investors intrigued by other start-up electric vehicle (EV) makers such as Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID) -- and if the latter keeps setting records for deliveries each quarter, should investors jump on board?\n\nMore records on deck? If you've been following Lucid over the past year and a half, you're probably aware that the company's delivery announcements have been almost entirely positive. Lucid delivered more than 4,000 vehicles during the third quarter, marking its seventh consecutive quarterly record. The result was a sizable 23% increase over the second quarter, and a 46% jump compared to the prior year.\n\nLucid has openly acknowledged that the Gravity production acceleration has gone a bit slower than desired, thanks to supply chain issues, including a shortage of Chinese magnets that held some of the automotive industry hostage during the spring. After navigating its way through some choppy waters that include those supply chain issues, as well as tariffs and the expiration of the $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit, there's good news: Significant progress has been made with Gravity production, and the next step for the vehicle should enable the company to continue setting quarterly delivery records.\nIt's also worth noting that the Gravity is expected to have six times the addressable market as Lucid's Air sedan, leaving immense potential in the near term as production ramps up.\n\nEnter the Touring It's common for automakers to launch premium versions or trims of vehicles first, to get more profitable production on the roads, and that's the playbook Lucid took with the Gravity launch. Currently, the Gravity Grand Touring sells with a starting price of $96,550, including shipping. Originally, Lucid promised a sub-$80,000 sticker price, which is finally being realized in the Touring. In addition to the Touring and Grand Touring, Lucid has developed a top-end Gravity Dream Edition priced at $141,550 with shipping.\n\nStory Continues\nLucid is currently launching the base version of the Gravity crossover with the Touring trim that delivers on the promised price tag and boasts 560 horsepower that helps the vehicle reach 60 miles per hour in 4 seconds. \"The Lucid Gravity Touring unlocks a new audience for the Lucid brand,\" said interim CEO Marc Winterhoff, according to Automotive News . \"There's not another SUV in its segment that can deliver the combination of range, interior space, and driving performance.\"\nWith the Gravity's base trim finally in production, it should position the EV maker to continue driving its deliveries higher. With all of that said, why then is Lucid's stock down roughly 52% over the past three months?\nWhat's the problem? The problem for Lucid investors isn't the company's surging deliveries or even the top-line it supports; rather, it's a cash squeeze and missed estimates sending the stock lower recently. Lucid lowered its annual production estimate over the summer to a range of 18,000 to 20,000 before settling on the low end of that range, missed top and bottom-line Wall Street estimates during the third quarter, and is still burning through cash.\n\nLucid increased its delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to $2 billion, which gives Lucid more capital for running business operations. Lucid also raised roughly $975 million in a private offering of convertible senior notes due in 2031, and most of the proceeds will go to repurchase existing senior notes due in 2026. These moves improved Lucid's financial flexibility in the near term and largely avoided shareholder dilution; however, this is likely not the end of Lucid's long-term capital needs.\nLucid promotes its consistent and continuous record of quarterly deliveries, but it's essential to recognize that Lucid faces numerous challenges ahead to achieve scale in production and deliveries, while also reducing costs to drive profitability. For most investors, Lucid is currently too risky to invest in, even with likely more record quarters ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lucid Group right now? Before you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lucid Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Google's AI Renaissance (Growth Story is Far from Over)\n\nAndrew Rocco\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGoogle Company Overview Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Alphabet ( GOOGL ) is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly accounting for roughly 90% of the online search volume and market share. Over the years, the company has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nAI Cannibalization Fears Overblown\nAlphabet’s dominant search market share and expanding cloud footprint are key growth drivers for the company. Initially, Google’s AI efforts got off to a shaky start. For instance, in Google’s first version AI model named “Bard,” searches often were completely inaccurate. Meanwhile, it appeared that ChatGPT and other models were running away with the AI race. However, several iterations later, and Google’s Gemini 2.5 AI delivers some of the most rapid responses in the industry and is viewed as an industry standard. Meanwhile, investor fears about cannibalization of the search business are unfounded. In fact, Google’s unique hybrid AI search model has driven popularity among younger users. Gemini models are being rapidly embedded across Search, YouTube, Android, and Workspace, enhancing user experience and driving internal productivity (e.g., coding, customer service).\n\nGoogle’s Groundbreaking TPU Google has constructed its own chips to power AI bots. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built to dramatically accelerate machine learning (ML) tasks, especially large-scale training and inference for models like Google's Gemini, powering Search, Photos, and more, available via Google Cloud and functioning as a core component of Google’s AI Hypercompute system. A TPU board fits into the same slot as a hard drive on the massive hardware racks inside the data centers that power Google's online services, the company says, adding that its own chips provide \"an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning\" than other hardware options. TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation.\"\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Gloud: A Consistent Growth Engine Alphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. In third-quarter 2025, Google Cloud revenues increased 33.5% year over year to $15.16 billion. Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics, and AI are positive. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, along with the growing number of data centers are helping Google expand its cloud footprint worldwide. Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA ( NVDA ) in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3, and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and the low-code Agent Designer tool.\n\nAd Business & YouTube Drive Top Line Growth AI is improving ad targeting and effectiveness, making the core business more resilient and profitable even with AI challengers. Meanwhile, YouTube continues to perform exceptionally well, acting as another strong pillar for revenue growth (especially the short-form video side). Zacks’ Consensus estimate sees double-digit top-line growth for the full year 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFuture Growth: Waymo Robotaxis Waymo is completing over 450,000 paid robotaxi rides per week across its operating areas, including Phoenix, LA, SF, and Austin. Reports from late 2025 indicate significant volume, a substantial increase from earlier in the year, with goals to reach 1 million weekly rides by late 2026. While I believe Tesla ( TSLA ) is poised to win the robotaxi race due to its scale and costs, there will likely not be one winner-takes-all and Waymo will have a significant chunk.\n\nImage Source: OurWorldinData\nBerkshire Hathaway Buys Alphabet Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently made a significant surprise investment, buying a $4.3 billion stake in Google's parent company, Alphabet, during the third quarter of 2025, marking a major tech bet for the value investor, likely driven by Alphabet's strong market dominance in search, its lucrative ad network, and potential in AI, despite Buffett's usual tech hesitation.\n\nGOOGL Has a Reasonable Valuation Google consistently has among the lowest P/Es among the Mag 7 stocks. With a P/E of 30x EPS, it’s reasonably priced and unsurprising that Buffett wants a piece. Additionally, the company has about $100 billion in cash and only $20 billion in debt. The strong cash balance provides the flexibility required to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStrong Trend & Technicals GOOGL shares have outperformed the general market indices and trended higher all year in a stair-stepping fashion. Investors can use the intermediate 10-week moving average as a trend guide.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nAlphabet remains one of the most strategically positioned companies in technology, combining dominant search economics, accelerating cloud momentum, and expanding AI-driven fundamentals.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That estimate sits below Bloomberg&rsquo;s broader consensus of around 445,000 units, which implies a milder 10% drop. Tesla noted the median analyst estimate was even lower, at roughly 420,400 vehicles.\n\nThe early disclosure has fueled speculation that Tesla is attempting to soften the market reaction ahead of a disappointing report. While Tesla shares were little changed in early trading, the numbers underline mounting pressure on the company&rsquo;s core auto business.\nA fourth-quarter slowdown was widely expected following the loss of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit at the start of the quarter. U.S. sales appear to have taken a particularly hard hit. According to Cox Automotive&rsquo;s Kelley Blue Book, Tesla sold about 125,900 vehicles in the U.S. during Q4, down more than 22% from a year earlier. International markets were expected to offset some of that weakness, but not enough to prevent an overall decline.\nFor the full year, consensus expectations now point to roughly 1.64 million deliveries , an 8% drop from 2024 and Tesla&rsquo;s second consecutive annual decline. Deutsche Bank has warned even those estimates may prove optimistic.\n\nOrdinarily, back-to-back years of falling sales would be difficult to reconcile with Tesla&rsquo;s valuation. The stock is up nearly 14% this year and trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio north of 200. Yet many analysts argue Tesla is no longer being valued as a carmaker.\nBullish analysts increasingly frame Tesla as a long-term bet on autonomy, robotics, and AI, with robotaxis and full self-driving technology seen as the real prize. In that context, weak deliveries matter&mdash;but not as much as the promise of what comes next.\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

      "Content": "Debt Is 'The Most Aggressively Marketed Product' In History, Says Dave Ramsey, After He Was Offered Klarna Payments For A T-Shirt\n\nAdrian Volenik\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 9:31 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: V\n\nMA\n\nKLAR\n\nTSLA\n\nFinancial expert Dave Ramsey responded to a listener’s question on an episode of “ The Ramsey Show ” about how someone could end up with 35 credit cards . His answer was straightforward: banks don’t care if you can afford it. They care if they can profit off of you.\nCredit Cards Are Marketed Harder Than Anything Else “That’s sweet that you’d think common sense would enter into this transaction,” Ramsey said to the listener named Cory. He explained that banks and credit card companies hand out credit not because people are financially sound, but because debt is extremely profitable.\nDon't Miss:\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n\n“We now, at this moment in 2024 in America, live in the most marketed-to, sold-to culture in the history of the world,” Ramsey said. “And among the most marketed-to group of people in the history of the human race, the most aggressively marketed product is debt .”\n“There are loans for everything,” he said about the constant push to finance even the smallest purchases. “I was trying to buy a T-shirt, for God’s sakes, and they offered me payments on it with Klarna ,” Ramsey said. “It’s a T-shirt! Why would you? Three easy payments of $1.26. I mean, come on.”\nRamsey warned listeners not to assume getting approved for credit means anything good. “Please God, don’t think you’re special if somebody gave you a credit card,” Ramsey said. He said they used to collect bizarre credit card stories, and among them was one in which even a dead pet had been approved–a person received a card for his deceased poodle, Fruu. Another card was sent to “Buck Naked,” a name someone made up as a joke.\n\nTrending: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nCo-host Rachel Cruze added that Visa (NYSE: V ) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA ) together hold 80% of the market and testified in front of Congress last year. Their refusal to lower swipe fees for small businesses showed, in her view, how little concern they have for the average American. “It makes you sick, it makes you realize; literally off the backs of Americans, this is what they’re making,” she said.\n“They’re here to make money off of you, and they know how to do it,” she added. “Like, that’s their job.”\nThe hosts concluded by reminding listeners that getting a new credit card doesn’t make you successful or financially savvy. Ramsey summed it up like this: “If you’re issued a new credit card, you’re no better than Fruu Fruu or Buck.”\n\nStory Continues\nRead Next:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n$100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "Tesla expected to deliver 15% fewer vehicles in Q4\n\nShannon Carroll\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla’s car sales continue to go in reverse — and the company is taking the unusual route of broadcasting that. Tesla published a compilation of analyst estimates on its website , and the fourth-quarter consensus from 20 firms pegs deliveries at 422,850 vehicles. If that figure holds, it lands roughly 15% below last year’s Q4 result and extends a slow, stubborn theme: Tesla’s growth story, in car units, keeps tripping over the real world.\n\nThe story here is less “analysts have an estimate” and more “Tesla chose the estimate.” And it chose a gloomy one. Tesla’s posted average is more pessimistic than Bloomberg’s compiled consensus (of about 445,061 vehicles), and other trackers have been higher, too (in the mid-440,000s range).\nSo Tesla is setting the bar where it wants the conversation to start: on the floor — and handing everyone a tape measure.\nT​his “soft” fourth quarter is arriving after a year that has looked like three different stories taped together. Tesla delivered 336,681 vehicles in Q1 2025; deliveries rose to 384,122 in Q2; and then, Tesla hit a record in Q3 : 497,099 deliveries. Now, the consensus says Q4 gives back a solid chunk of that momentum — and the reason is less about factory choreography or consumer behavior and more about policy gravity .\n\nFederal EV tax credits — $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used — expired on Sept. 30, 2025. And deadlines like that don’t erase short-term demand so much as rearrange it. Buyers who were on the fence get shoved into a single quarter, and the next quarter gets stuck holding the bag. Tesla’s November U.S. sales fell nearly 23% year over year to 39,800 vehicles, according to Cox Automotive data, even after Tesla rolled out cheaper ( but still not that cheap ) “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3.\nCEO Elon Musk has tried to wave away vehicle demand anxiety as a media obsession — “they’re fine, don’t worry about it,” he said in May — even as he later warned investors to brace for “a few rough quarters” in what he called a “weird transition period.” Tesla has been trying to ramp up the conversation about its long-promised robotaxis in Austin, Texas, ahead of Musk’s year-end target for safety-monitor-free rides. With a day to spare, it looks like that prediction's at least true in testing (and not at the fleet level as Musk has promised): Musk says a “Tesla with no safety monitor” drove him around Austin, and Tesla’s AI lead posted video of an empty front seat.\n\nZoom out, and the EV market is growing, but unevenly. Global EV registrations rose 6% in November, yet North America fell 42% as the post-credit slump spread. Europe is moving in the opposite direction on adoption — battery-electric vehicles are 17% of EU registrations year-to-date through November. Add in intensifying competition, including cheaper EV options from legacy automakers such as Chevrolet and Ford and expanding Chinese brands overseas, and Tesla’s fourth-quarter setup starts to look structural, not seasonal.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd yet, none of this has stopped Tesla’s stock from behaving like the car business is merely the opening act. The company’s shares are up more than 10% this year (and 21% year to date), a sign that plenty of investors are paying for the robotaxi dream and tolerating the delivery math. That split — cars down, narrative up — remains Tesla’s one real magic trick.\nTesla has already trained investors to expect a rationale for every wobble. Earlier in the year, the company blamed a Model Y line changeover across all four factories for “several weeks” of lost production. Q4 doesn’t come with that built-in excuse. If the consensus is right, this is what demand looks like when the incentives are gone, the field is crowded, and Tesla has to sell cars like a normal automaker — while its stock still trades like an AI bet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla Broadcasts Downbeat Sales Estimates in Unusual Move\n\nCraig Trudell\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:24 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. took the unusual step of publishing a series of sales estimates indicating the outlook for its vehicle deliveries may be lower than many investors were expecting.\nThe carmaker posted estimates to its website showing analysts on average expect the company to deliver 422,850 cars in the fourth quarter, down 15% from a year earlier. That compares with a Bloomberg-compiled average of 440,907 vehicles, an 11% drop.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nWhile Tesla’s investor relations team has compiled sales estimates and shared averages selectively with analysts and investors for years, the company hasn’t published the figures in the past.\n“This is highly unusual,” Gary Black, co-founder of Future Fund Advisors, wrote on X. “Obviously, someone at TSLA wanted the IR-derived consensus to be distributed as widely as possible,” he added, speculating that Tesla’s deliveries are likely to be in the range of 420,000 vehicles.\nTesla is on course for its second consecutive drop in annual vehicle sales, with the company compiling an average estimate for 1.6 million deliveries, down more than 8% from a year earlier. The carmaker’s estimates for the next three years are also lower than averages compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe company’s shares fell as much as 1.3% on Tuesday before erasing the decline.\nTesla’s sales plunged early in the year as the company retooled production lines at each of its assembly plants for the redesigned Model Y, its most popular vehicle. That period also coincided with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk playing a polarizing role in the Trump administration.\nDeliveries jumped to a record in the third quarter, when US consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles before $7,500 federal tax credits ceased at the end of September. Tesla partially offset the loss of those incentives at the beginning of the current quarter by rolling out stripped-down versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan each priced at under $40,000.\nTesla’s stock is poised to end the year higher despite its vehicle sales slump. The shares were up 14% through Monday’s close, trailing the 17% rise in the S&P 500 Index.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla previews a drop in its upcoming Q4 deliveries in unusual move\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:14 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nIn a first for the company, Tesla ( TSLA ) previewed its own fourth quarter quarter deliveries release.\nOn its investor relations site , Tesla posted its own Wall Street consensus estimates for Q4 and full-year deliveries. For Q4, Tesla said \"company compiled delivery consensus\" came in at 422,850 units globally, which would represent a 15% drop from a year ago.\nInterestingly, that figure is below the 445,000 delivery estimate as compiled via Bloomberg, which would only be a 10% drop. Tesla reported the median estimate was 420,399.\nTesla stock was little changed in early trading on Tuesday.\n\nSome commentators have speculated that Tesla's release of these compiled estimates means the company is trying to get ahead of a poor delivery report and cushion the blow.\nA fourth quarter delivery drop is not exactly a surprise given the loss of the $7,500 EV tax credit at the start of the quarter. The question was how bad the drop would be in the US and whether international markets could overcome sales losses in the US. Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book estimates Tesla US sales fell to 125.9K units in the quarter, down 22.4%.\n\nFor the year, Tesla's consensus estimates came in at 1,640,752 deliveries, an 8% drop compared to 2024 and the automaker's second consecutive year of sales declines.\nDeutsche Bank also feels the Wall Street consensus of over 1.6 million units is too optimistic.\n\"We believe consensus estimates of 1.66m in deliveries may be too high and we model 1.62m units based on our 4Q assumptions, implying down 9% YoY,\" analyst Edison Yu wrote in mid December.\nA second consecutive year of sales losses isn't typically congruent for a stock that has gained nearly 14% this year, with a forward P/E of over 200, per Yahoo Finance calculations .\nBut analysts like Deutsche Bank's Yu and Wedbush's Dan Ives argue fundamentals don't matter for stocks like Tesla, which are bets more on mobility, robotics, and AI than the traditional auto business.\nYu and Ives are bullish on Tesla's robotaxi prospects.\n\"Perhaps more importantly though, the narrative around robotaxi remains strong despite the size of the fleet tracking smaller than expected thus far,\" Yu wrote. \"In late October, [CEO] Elon Musk alluded to 1,000 vehicles in the Bay Area and 500 or more in Austin. Our tracking suggests they are not going to achieve these levels. However, Tesla did remove the safety driver in Austin this past weekend for testing internal validation, suggesting a wider roll-out is coming soon.\"\n\nStory Continues\nEarlier on Tuesday, Ives named Tesla one of his top AI plays for 2026, with the \"robotics chapter\" for the company set to begin.\n\"Heading into 2026 this marks a monster year ahead for Tesla and Musk,\" Ives wrote. \"We believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun in our view with FSD [full self driving] and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose for Musk & Co.\"\nPras Subramanian is Lead Auto Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Baird analyst Ben Kallo maintained his Outperform rating and $548 price target for Tesla, calling it a \"core holding\" for the coming year.Shares are up 21% in 2025 and 7% in the past month, outperforming the market. Kallo advised investors to watch Tesla's robotaxi service, expansion into China and Europe, and energy category growth.Further manufacturing details and Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus are expected in 2026. After abandoning the \"Model 2\" sedan, Tesla is growing Semi truck manufacturing and strengthening its lineup.Baird predicts that paid robotaxi service will begin in 2027 and that Optimus will be sold. The $548 target is roughly 70 times 2030 EBITDA discounted to 2026.Even though competition is increasing and prices are rising, analysts believe Tesla's development in robots, autonomy, and energy will help it flourish.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Exchanges Decline to List Tuttle Capital's GRFT ETF Despite SEC Effectiveness\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:58 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nCBOE\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nWall Street's roughly $13 trillion ETF ecosystem continued to push deeper into higher-risk territory this year, as issuers leaned into demand from retail investors drawn to leverage, yield and unconventional strategies. Against that backdrop, Tuttle Capital Management encountered resistance with its proposed Government Grift ETF, ticker GRFT, which is intended to invest in companies with perceived connections to political power in Washington. While the fund's registration became effective with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the fourth quarter, Bloomberg Intelligence's James Seyffart noted that this step represents a procedural milestone rather than an active regulatory endorsement, potentially limiting its path forward. Despite that status, Tuttle said the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets have so far declined to list the ETF, offering little explanation beyond informal rejections.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe stalled listing arrives as high-octane ETFs including leveraged single-stock products, crypto-themed funds and strategies tied to short-dated options have proliferated, supported by a regulatory tone that took shape during the Trump administration. Tuttle has previously filed leveraged ETFs linked to figures and companies such as Michael Saylor, Trump's media company, Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), positioning his firm around turning market narratives into volatile trading vehicles aimed at risk-seeking investors. GRFT, which would be actively managed, does not reference specific politicians or administrations, but is designed to track what Tuttle has described as unusual congressional trading activity, reflecting a view that political proximity could be associated with financial outcomes.\n\nSome industry analysts have suggested the ETF's premise could expose exchanges to reputational or administrative risk, possibly drawing regulatory or congressional scrutiny. While politically themed ETFs already exist including NANC and GOP, launched in 2023 to track disclosures under the STOCK Act, and MAGA, launched in 2017 critics argue GRFT's framing is more pointed and potentially contentious. Skeptics also note that any link between political access and market outperformance is often assumed rather than demonstrated, with outcomes shaped by slow-moving policy decisions and broader industrial factors. Even so, Tuttle has said his remaining hope lies with the Texas Stock Exchange, which is expected to begin trading in the first quarter next year, and he plans to keep the ETF's name, ticker and investment thesis unchanged, arguing that presidential politics in the Trump era could continue to have an unusually direct influence on individual stocks.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The EV maker publishing data it compiled of fourth quarter delivery expectations from analysts and the outlook is minus a charge. According to Tesla's count, the expectation is deliveries will be down 15% in the final three months of the year compared to a year ago.\n00:30 Speaker A\nAnd that estimate is even worse than Wall Street consensus, but the news doesn't appear to be bad enough to shaking to shake investor optimism.

So much luster on these names.\n01:10 Speaker A\nFinally, Boeing. The stock is taking flight after securing an 8.6 billion dollar Air Force contract.

The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing.

This is a lot more than what Mercedes-Benz and BMW manufacture.\nThe Model Y sold the most. It featured a long range, quick acceleration, and could be used as an SUV. Analysts say that Tesla's success originates from the fact that it seems like a tech savvy brand and that young people regard it as a technology instead of a car because of the \"fandom culture.\" People are still thrilled about the device even if there have been recalls and other problems since the software is updated often and it looks good.\nThe stock's average price target is $385.34, which suggests it might drop 17% from its current level.

The firm also pointed to “positive data points for FSD,” including praise for FSD 14 from Nvidia’s robotics team.\nBaird maintained its $548 price target on TSLA, based on around 70 times its 2030 EBITDA estimate discounted to year-end 2026.\nRelated articles\nTesla stock forecast: Baird previews 2026\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

This figure is notably lower than the Bloomberg-compiled average of 445,061 vehicles, which indicates a 10% drop.\n\nWhile Tesla’s investor relations team has been compiling average delivery estimates for years, this marks the first time the company has shared these figures on its investor relations page.\nThe electric vehicle maker appears to be heading toward its second consecutive annual decline in vehicle sales. The company has compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million deliveries for the full year, down more than 8% compared to last year.\nDespite the vehicle sales slump, Tesla’s stock is on track to end the year with gains. The shares were up 14% through Monday’s close, though this performance trails behind the S&P 500 Index’s 17% rise during the same period.\nRelated articles\nTesla’s compilation of analyst delivery estimates shows 15% drop in Q4\nGold: $4K Breakout Faces First Real Test as Stocks and Sentiment Rise Together\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The year 2025 remains on track to be a positive one for equity investors, but the success of the Santa Claus Rally is by no means assured as some caution and volatility seems to be in play. Along those lines, reading the tea leaves contained in insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research is a challenging task this week. For starters, transaction volume historically is low in the final trading days of any year, diminishing the quality of the data. But this year, the days are 'even quieter' because of two 'added' federal holidays that left the SEC closed for three of the five business days last week (the SEC being the source of the Form 4 documents filed by insiders when they transact). To add some detail, 466 filings meet the criteria for inclusion in Vickers' Weekly Insider Report this week, compared to 1641 last week. Turning to longer-term (eight-week) data to mitigate the short-term (one-week) weakness, we note that the data is solidly neutral, suggesting corporate insiders are not eager to buy stock -- but nor are they selling aggressively. On a scale where the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, Vickers' eight-week sell/buy ratio for the NYSE is 3.44, the Nasdaq ratio is 3.90, and the Total (all exchanges) ratio is 3.67.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

CEO Elon Musk has slammed Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates amid the USAID cuts row.\nBill Gates Is A Liar Taking to the social media platform X on Sunday, the billionaire criticized Gates in response to a post that aimed at claims about deaths resulting from the President Donald Trump administration's announcement of funding cuts provided to the UN via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nMusk said that Gates was \"pushing this lie, despite having over $80 billion dollars in his NGO,\" calling the claims false. He added that the former Microsoft CEO could \"easily spend to save these alleged lives that are being lost.\" Musk also added that Gates was \"a liar.\"\nThe Gates Foundation didn’t immediately respond to Benzinga ‘s request for comment.\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nIt's worth noting that Gates had earlier warned of \"devastating effects\" on HIV programs in Africa. The billionaire had also raised concerns about the Trump administration's decision to cut funding would result in millions of people being unvaccinated and trigger a global health crisis.\n\nElon Musk's DOGE Cut Aid Gates has previously expressed concerns about the aid cuts. The aid cuts stemmed from the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effectively shutting down by significant funding cuts to USAID, as it was \"time for it to die,\" according to the SpaceX CEO back in February.\nMusk and Gates have also clashed over other topics. Most notably, the Tesla CEO has called out Gates over his alleged short position against Tesla stock that Gates has had \"for ~8 years,\" according to Musk.\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

That compares with a Bloomberg-compiled average of 445,061 vehicles, a 10% drop.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nWhile Tesla’s investor relations team has compiled average delivery estimates for years, the company hasn’t shared the figures on its IR page in the past. The carmaker is on course for its second consecutive decline in annual vehicle sales, having compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million deliveries, down more than 8% from a year earlier.\nTesla’s sales plunged early in the year as the company retooled production lines at each of its assembly plants for the redesigned Model Y, its most popular vehicle. That period also coincided with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk playing a polarizing role in the Trump administration.\nDeliveries jumped to a record in the third quarter, when US consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles before $7,500 federal tax credits ceased at the end of September. Tesla partially offset the loss of those incentives at the beginning of the current quarter by rolling out stripped-down versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan each priced at under $40,000.\nTesla’s stock is poised to end the year higher despite its vehicle sales slump.

Silver and gold swung after a sharp pullback from fresh all-time highs, as traders booked profits and liquidity thinned after the holidays.\nCrypto traders kept describing the same theme, a market that keeps moving, then does it with less depth.\nMarket snapshot Bitcoin : $87,164, down 1.9%\nEther : $2,929, down 2.3%\nXRP: $1.85, down 2.2%\nTotal crypto market cap: $3.03 trillion, down 2.1%\nBitcoin And Ether Drift Sideways As Year-End Volumes Fade Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, said year-end trading has slowed and volumes have faded across major assets. “Bitcoin and Ethereum have both traded largely sideways over the past week, reflecting seasonal inactivity rather than a meaningful shift in market structure,” he said.\n“Activity has cooled across most chains, with a broad consolidation in active addresses, transactions, and fees generated over the past 30 days. Chains like Base saw notable pullbacks in DEX volumes following a very strong run earlier in the year. Solana remains the dominant venue for onchain trading by volume, even as user activity softened slightly over the week, with BNB Chain a distant second.”\n\n“Overall, trading activity hasn’t disappeared; it has simply slowed and become more selective as the year comes to a close.”\nProfit-Taking Hits Metals After New Highs Macro investors, meanwhile, stayed focused on the policy path. Investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes due later Tuesday, a release that often resets rate expectations when positioning runs crowded.\nThe bigger picture still shows a strong year for risk assets, despite the late-year wobbles. The MSCI All Country World Index has climbed about 21% in 2025, and a broad measure of Asian stocks has rallied almost 26%, according to market-wrap data.\n\nIn metals, the latest move showed how quickly crowded trades can unwind. Spot silver fell 4.8% on Monday after earlier hitting a record, and gold eased after setting its own peak on Friday, with profit-taking doing the heavy lifting.\nFor crypto, Bitcoin’s steadiness looked more like a positioning pause than a conviction push, with traders watching liquidity, flows and volatility pricing for the next move into the first week of 2026.\nRead original story Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Holds $87k As Asia Rally Stalls, Wall Street Tech Slips by Shalini Nagarajan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In a filing, L&F said the reason for the 99% reduction was a change in supply quantity.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nThe high-nickel cathode material that L&F was contracted to supply from January 2024 through this month was meant to be used in Cybertruck batteries, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive business transactions. Scant material was provided as the vehicle’s development was repeatedly postponed and consumers opted for other vehicles, including Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, the person said.\nThe supply contract was also affected by broader policy and economic issues, including the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, the person added. Tesla representatives didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nL&F said in a statement that the revision was inevitable as schedules were adjusted in line with changes in the global electric vehicle market and battery supply conditions.\n“There have been no changes to shipments or customer supply of the company’s flagship high-nickel product,” L&F said, adding that shipments to major Korean cell manufacturers are proceeding smoothly.\nShares of L&F, which also supplies battery makers including LG Energy Solution Ltd., dropped 11% in Seoul on Tuesday.

Nio IPO'd in 2018 and has fallen 19% since going public. Trading volume reached 68.1 million shares, nearly 28% above its three-month average of 53.4 million shares.\n\nHow the markets moved today Monday’s action followed premarket focus on Nio's deeper battery reliance on Contemporary Amperex Technology (OTC:CYAT.Y) and a bullish CEO sales outlook. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.33% to 6,907, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 0.50% to 23,474. Within the automotive industry, shares of sector rivals Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) dropped 3.27% and 1.61%, respectively.\n\nWhat this means for investors Nio has expanded its offerings by introducing two new brands, launching the mass-market brand Onvo and a new premium compact brand, Firefly, last year.\nThis strategy to expand market reach has so far been successful. October marked the first time the company delivered over 40,000 vehicles in a single month. This was followed by Nio's second-largest shipment month ever in November.\n\nToday's move came after Nio CEO William Li offered an upbeat Q4 forecast. The midpoint of Li's vehicle delivery guidance implies another new record of over 45,000 units is coming for December. Li also predicted very strong total fourth-quarter sales, indicating discounts aren't what's driving sales.\nNio stock also got a boost today from reports saying the company is relying more on CATL for batteries and has suspended supply cooperation with competitor BYD for the Onvo L60.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) dipped around 0.3%.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility gripped the precious metals trade after a furious rally to all-time highs . Silver ( SI=F ) retreated, plummeting as much as 7% after rising above $80, while gold ( GC=F ) futures fell over 3%.\nStocks fell after ending a shortened Christmas trading week near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 and Dow setting records on Wednesday to start the \"Santa Claus rally\" period — the last five trading days of December and first two sessions in January.\n\nAll three major indexes look set to end a topsy-turvy 2025 with strong gains. The benchmark S&P is up over 17%, and the blue-chip Dow has climbed over 14%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has led gains, adding over 21% so far — even after briefly entering a bear market in April after the rollout of President Trump's most sweeping tariffs .\nIn another otherwise relatively sleepy week for economic releases, one bright spot came on Monday as data showed pending home sales in November jumped the most since early 2023 — a sign that homebuyer momentum is building. But the highlight of the week will likely come Tuesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting earlier this month .\nThe minutes could add fresh insight for investors looking for clues on the Fed's next move in January, with the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 likely to continue into the new year . Around 80% of bets are on the Fed standing pat at current interest rate levels next month, though traders are more split on what the committee will do in March.\nLIVE 15 updates\n7 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nStocks slip as hopes of 'Santa Clause rally' fade Stocks pulled back on Monday as hopes of a \"Santa Claus\" rally during the last week of the year faced a setback.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) fell 0.5% as shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia ( NVDA ) fell 1% while EV maker Tesla ( TSLA ) dropped more than 3%.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) lost 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also slipped 0.5%.\nCrude prices rose more than 2% while precious metals retreated from all-time highs.

Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2.6% in the afternoon session after major indices pulled back from record highs reached the previous week.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq were under pressure as the dominant artificial intelligence trade cooled off. Notable names like Nvidia were down as traders locked in profits following a banner year where the Nasdaq surged over 20%. With the S&P 500 recently hitting intraday highs near 6,945, this dip reflected a shift in internal momentum rather than a response to major economic news.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunties to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Tesla? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 40 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 2.8% on the news that a Delaware Supreme Court ruling restored CEO Elon Musk's 2018 compensation plan, ending a long-running legal battle.\n\nThe court reversed a lower court's decision to cancel the $56 billion pay package. This news removed a significant legal uncertainty that had loomed over the company. Adding to the positive sentiment, the company reportedly began testing fully driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, without safety drivers, marking a major step toward commercial autonomous driving. Investor focus also turned to Tesla's 2026 product plans, which included a sub-$25,000 model and the first commercial use of its Cybercab. Further bolstering confidence, Deutsche Bank and RBC both raised their price targets on the stock.\nTesla is up 22.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $463.89 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $489.88 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,090.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-2026-could-be-waymos-year-195850263.html",
      "Content": "Why 2026 could be Waymo's year\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:58 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nUBER\n\nZK\n\nFrom Los Angeles to Austin to Atlanta, Waymo robotaxis are everywhere. And 2026 could be the year Waymo expands its lead in the space.\nWaymo, part of Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), began in 2009 as an in-house startup within Google's X initiative and officially became Waymo in 2016. In 2018, Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker's I-Pace EV for its testing. This is the vehicle most users are accustomed to seeing.\n\nSince 2020, anyone in its service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that it performs around 250,000 trips a week and has performed 20 million trips since the service began.\nBut those numbers are likely to jump, perhaps big-time. The company is targeting around 1 million rides a week by the end of 2026 — four times its current volume.\nWhy 2026 could be a big year for Waymo In 2026, Waymo will enter its most aggressive expansion phase yet, moving beyond its current territories to tackle more US cities and international markets.\nCurrently, Waymo has robotaxi fleets in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta, where users can summon vehicles using Waymo's app or from partners like Uber ( UBER ) in Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe plan for 2026 moves beyond those areas, eventually adding 20 new markets. Waymo says it is progressing in test areas in the South, including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, with full service expected to begin in early 2026.\nIn the West, the company plans to add Las Vegas and San Diego, with targeted service start dates in 2026.\nIn the Northeast, Waymo is testing in Detroit and Washington, D.C., also for 2026 launches, and added Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis to the list earlier this month. The difficulties with northern cities, which are prone to inclement weather and conditions like snow that could block the cars' sensors, is of particular importance. Each of these cities will begin Waymo service with human operators before scaling up to driverless. The human operator sits the driver's seat and takes over if needed.\n\nThe company is also testing in highly populous areas like New York City , which requires special permitting and will likely take a much longer time to ramp up to official service. The company did not give a targeted start date for New York City service. Waymo is also scheduled to add service in London, its first international market, starting sometime in 2026, and has been testing in Tokyo since April.\nFor its part, Tesla ( TSLA ), which operates a ride-hailing service service with safety occupants, has only been in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area since mid-2025 but will supposedly expand in Nevada and Phoenix next year.\n\nStory Continues\nTo meet these goals, the company is expanding its manufacturing facilities. Waymo, along with its manufacturing parter Magna, will expand its new plant in Arizona to double production and build more than 2,000 vehicles at the facility by the end of 2026.\nThe company will begin to assemble its next-generation robotaxi on Zeekr's RT platform, with the stated goal of building \"tens of thousands\" of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year.\n\nWall Street is mostly in favor.\n\"Waymo is furthest along in true driverless deployment: it is already operating fully autonomous ride-hail services in parts of Phoenix, San Francisco (Bay Area), Los Angeles, and testing in additional US cities, with no safety driver in the vehicle for many rides,\" Deutsche Bank's Edison Yu wrote in early December. \"These are limited geofence, high CAPEX operations, but they prove the technical feasibility of Level 4 autonomy in constrained urban zones.\"\nBut Yu added that Waymo's tech \"stack\" is heavily dependent on costly equipment like lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors, radar, and cameras, and is map-dependent, which slows scaling speed and pushes up the per-vehicle cost.\nMorgan Stanley's robotics research team, now led by longtime analyst Adam Jonas, agrees that Waymo's tech, though impressive, will be held back by higher costs compared to Tesla, which uses a vision-only system powered by a neural network, essentially acting like a robotic driver.\nIn Waymo's defense, the company and analysts like Deutsche Bank's Yu argue that the complement of sensors and cameras helps with reliability and safety.\nWaymo's data shows its robotaxis are involved in fewer accidents involving serious injury, airbag deployment, or any injury, for that matter, compared to human drivers. In fact, a human driver is five times more likely to be involved in an accident resulting in an injury compared to a Waymo robotaxi (0.8 crashes per 1 million miles in Waymo vs 3.96 crashes per 1 million miles with a human driver).\n\nThough details are still scarce, Tesla data via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shows Tesla robotaxis had seven crashes in 250,000 miles, implying a crash rate of around 28 crashes per 1 million miles.\nPublic safety is also a key regulatory challenge facing both Waymo and Tesla, with permitting across various municipalities complicated to navigate and possible overarching federal guidelines that the NHTSA hinted may be coming.\n\nAnd though not a passenger safety concern, the electrical blackout on Dec. 20 in San Francisco led to embarrassing \"bricking\" of Waymo robotaxis , leaving them stuck in the middle of streets, unable to move due to traffic signals being inoperative. Incidents like these are headaches for municipalities, though Waymo promises a software update will alleviate these incidents.\n\nNevertheless, passenger safety is most important, and Waymo's data reporting showing its strong safety record will help cities looking to test robotaxis in their jurisdictions, as well as win over the public, which may be open to but skeptical about riding in driverless cars.\nWaymo's own ubiquitousness may also help in its rollout. While a survey performed by the Verge in April 2024 found that, overall, 45% of respondents believed robotaxi services were safe (compared to 37% against), the percentages were actually higher in cities where Waymo was already operating (54% for and 32% against).\nA recent survey conducted in San Francisco this past July found that ​​67% of San Francisco residents now support the operation of driverless robotaxis, up from 44% in 2023, with \"net favorability\" of robotaxis swinging from -7% in late 2023 to +38% in mid-2025.\nPras Subramanian is Lead Auto Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ: NFLX ) to acquire the film and television assets of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD ) fear the deal will be the death of movie theaters , but \"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary says, \"Factually, that's not correct.\"\n\nIn a post on X , O'Leary argued that the competition isn't between streaming and theaters but a fight for human attention.\n\"People watch movies on their phones, their tablets, their home TVs, in theaters,\" he said. \"There's never been a more diversified way of screening content.\n\"The only restraining aspect of content consumption is how many hours people are awake,\" he added.\nDon't Miss:\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nO'Leary said Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is a prime example of why the big screen remains vital. Amazon continues to fund major theatrical releases because certain cinematic experiences cannot be replicated in a living room.\n\nTheaters that lean into high-end technology, such as 70-millimeter screens and the Dolby surround sound, he said.\n\"Those experiences cannot be emulated in a home,\" O'Leary said. \"If you've got a big-tent release, an action film particularly, most people would want to see that in an adequate surround sound, large screen. You need every tool you can get in the media war. \"\nWhile O'Leary says movie theaters aren't going anywhere, shifting consumer behavior shows that streaming at home is winning the volume game. About 75% of U.S. adults chose streaming a new release at least once in the past year, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll .\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate— Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nAlthough 66% of Americans still visited a cinema, only 16% maintained a monthly movie-going habit, nearly half the rate of frequent streamers, according to the poll.\nDriven by rising ticket prices and the post-pandemic desire for convenience, the data suggests that the couch has replaced the cinema as a preferred venue for routine viewing. The average cost of a movie ticket in the U.S. is $13.17, the Associated Press reported, citing data firm EntTelligence. In 2022, it was $11.76.\n\"There's some movies I would like to see, and I say to myself, I'll just wait until they show them on TV or I'll go visit a friend who has those apps,\" Maryneal Jones of North Carolina told the AP.

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dipped around 0.4%.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility gripped the precious metals trade after a furious rally to all-time highs .

The benchmark S&P is up over 17%, and the blue-chip Dow has climbed over 14%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has led gains, adding over 22% so far — even after briefly entering a bear market in April after the rollout of President Trump's most sweeping tariffs .\nAnother relatively sleepy week will greet investors heading into the new year. A read on pending home sales is on the docket Monday. But the highlight of the week will likely come Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting earlier this month .\nThe minutes could add fresh insight for investors looking for clues on the Fed's next move in January, with the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 likely to continue into the new year .

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ( CL=F ), the US benchmark, picked up 2.4% to land above $58.\n\nIn comments at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, President Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said substantial progress has been made toward reaching a deal to end the conflict in Ukraine, though several issues remain open questions. Kyiv and Moscow also have yet to make progress on the issue of concessions over land captured by Russia during the conflict.\nSanctions from the US Treasury Department seeking to curtail Russia's ability to sell its oil internationally are likely to remain in place until a peace agreement is reached. The sanctions are likely keeping several hundred thousand barrels of oil off the market, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, even as Russia continues to find buyers in China and India willing to take Russian barrels at a steep discount.\nAt the same time, a monthly decline in output reported by Kazakhstan and escalating rhetoric from Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have put upward pressure on prices from the Middle East.\nKazakhstan's massive Tengiz oilfield, where Chevron ( CVX ) serves as the lead operator, led a decline of 6% in monthly output in December after attacks by Ukrainian drones damaged a Russian export terminal on the Black Sea, according to Reuters.\nProduction also fell in the Tengiz field in December, according to Reuters, even as Chevron has spent the year working on a nearly $50 billion effort to increase production in the field by roughly 1 million barrels per day.\nOil is headed for its fifth straight monthly decline as December comes to a close.\n\n35 mins ago Laura Bratton\n\nStocks slip at the open US stocks pulled back at the market open on Monday, dampening hopes for a so-called \"Santa Claus\" rally — the historic upturn in stocks during the last five trading days of December and first two sessions in January.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led declines at the open of Monday's session, falling 0.7%, as Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) dropped more than 2%.

L&F disclosed that a 3.83 trillion won supply contract announced in February 2023 has been revised down to 9.73 million won, citing a change in supply quantity. The reduction, amounting to roughly 99%, reflects how initial volume expectations have been reset as market and production assumptions evolved.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with KGFHF.\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe high-nickel cathode material covered by the contract was scheduled for delivery from January 2024 through this month and was intended for Cybertruck batteries, according to a person familiar with the matter. Actual shipments were limited as the Cybertruck's development was repeatedly postponed, while some consumers possibly opted for other Tesla models such as the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle. The person added that broader policy and economic factors, including the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, also weighed on the final supply outcome.\nL&F said the contract revision was unavoidable as schedules were adjusted in line with changes in the global electric-vehicle market and battery supply conditions, while stressing that there have been no changes to shipments of its flagship high-nickel product to other customers. The company added that supplies to major Korean cell manufacturers continue to proceed smoothly. Following the disclosure, L&F shares dropped more than 6% after the close of regular trading in Seoul, though the stock remains up 16% this year, trailing the 76% gain in the Kospi Index.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The South Korean corporation could not explain the dramatic drop. The 2023 agreement covered Tesla and its affiliates' high-nickel cathode materials from January 2024 to December 2025.Analysts and insiders say the supplies were for Tesla's 4680 battery cells, used mostly in the Cybertruck. Tesla needs less cathode materials since 4680 battery production is slower than projected. Sales of the Cybertruck have also lagged. Tesla admitted scaling issues with the 4680 battery architecture and a new dry electrode production method.L&F and Tesla did not reply to calls for comment. Analysts said the contract drop indicates technical issues and a worldwide electric car demand slump. As automakers cut EV investment plans, South Korean battery producers have cancelled orders and pulled down cooperation. The withdrawal followed policy uncertainty and U.S. electric vehicle subsidy expiry.Investors will examine Tesla's earnings and production updates for battery output objectives and demand patterns, while L&F's forecast will show how the altered deal impacts revenue.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Following President Donald Trump's election last year, the stock came into 2025 riding high, as investors believed that CEO Elon Musk's ties to the president would make life easier for Tesla, especially on the regulatory front.\nHowever, Tesla struggled earlier this year due to a variety of factors, including weak electric vehicle sales, and as investors anticipated the expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which is expected to hurt EV demand. Musk also proved controversial, due to his involvement with the initiative called the Department of Government Efficiency and public arguments with Trump.\nHowever, the stock has rebounded thanks to investor enthusiasm surrounding Tesla's full self-driving technology, the launch of the company's robotaxi fleet, and excitement about other artificial intelligence initiatives, such as Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots. The stock is up close to 28% on the year as I write this. Is Tesla still a millionaire maker?\n\nContinues to be a battleground stock Tesla remains a battleground stock on Wall Street. Some believe the stock, trading at 296 times forward earnings estimates, is wildly overvalued. Others, like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, believe investors can still get in on the ground floor of what could ultimately prove to be one of the most innovative AI companies in the world.\n\nWood has a 2029 price target of $2,600 per share for Tesla. That implies 436% upside from the Dec. 25 price. To make $1 million in this scenario, one would need to invest $230,000 now, a huge chunk of money for someone not already a millionaire. But even if it takes 20 years for Wood's prediction to be correct, that would still be a good investment.\nI'm personally in the bear camp and think that Tesla is overvalued, but the jury is still out on the stock. Regardless, it would take a big bet to become a millionaire.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This material was intended for use in Cybertruck batteries, according to a Bloomberg report on Monday that cited a person familiar with the matter.\nOnly minimal material was delivered as Cybertruck development faced repeated delays. Consumers instead opted for other Tesla vehicles, including the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle.\nThe supply agreement was also impacted by broader policy and economic factors, including the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, the report added.\nRelated articles\nTesla supplier sees 99% cut in battery material contract amid Cybertruck woes\nSilver's Bullish Pattern Points Higher — Keep an Eye on $52 Resistance Zone\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy in January That Could Issue Stock Splits in 2026\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:46 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nAPP\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points ASML's share price has crossed the $1,000 threshold as AI fuels demand for its EUV systems.\nAppLovin's rampant growth has positioned the stock for its first-ever split.\nTesla has run to another high on optimism for humanoid robotics.\n10 stocks we like better than ASML ›\nInvestors tend to see more companies issue stock splits when the market is doing well, and share prices are high. A stock split is the corporate version of taking a pie and cutting it into smaller, equal-sized slices. The pie remains the same size, but there are more slices, and each represents a smaller portion of the pie.\n\nA stock split lowers a stock's share price, but it doesn't change any of its valuations or business fundamentals. Investors tend to applaud stock splits because they usually occur after a stock has performed well, and having more shares makes it easier to buy and sell.\nIt's been a fantastic year for many growth stocks across the market. ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) , AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have risen by 54%, 125%, and 20% respectively, in 2025.\nHere is why each stock is a potential buy and stock split candidate in 2026.\n1. ASML ASML plays a crucial role in semiconductor manufacturing as the only company that builds extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which etch complex designs on silicon wafers using light and are vital components in the manufacture of the most advanced semiconductor chipsets. The ongoing artificial intelligence boom is driving demand for ASML's EUV systems. The stock has been volatile at times. ASML became entangled in some geopolitical tensions between the United States and China over access to its machinery. Still, there is now sufficient clarity that management is guiding for 7.6% to 13.3% annualized revenue growth through 2030.\nThe stock isn't cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of 36 times full-year earnings estimates, but that's because analysts estimate ASML will grow earnings by over 22% annually for the next three to five years. ASML's last stock split occurred over a decade ago, and its shares have since skyrocketed higher. Trading at over $1,000 per share today, ASML seems ripe for a stock split in 2026.\n\n2. AppLovin Mobile phones have become a massive market, with billions of people using smartphones and various applications every day. AppLovin's business caters to these smartphone users, and it has soared in recent years, as has the company's stock. AppLovin offers software tools that help mobile app and game developers target, acquire, and monetize users. The company went public amid a market bubble in 2021. Yet, the stock has still risen by 1,000% over its lifetime.\n\nStory Continues\nAppLovin is currently one of the fastest-growing companies on the stock market. Revenue increased by a whopping 68% to $1.4 billion last quarter. The stock is priced accordingly at 78 times full-year earnings estimates, but it has room to grow into that valuation. Grand View Research estimates the mobile ad-tech market could approach $1 trillion by 2030. The stock now trades at over $700 per share, making it a prime candidate for its first-ever stock split.\n\n3. Tesla Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla remains a controversial stock. Shares trade near all-time highs despite the company's core vehicle business slowing. Why? CEO Elon Musk has Tesla leaning into a colossal humanoid robotics opportunity. With its humanoid, Tesla Optimus, the company aims to take an early lead in what some researchers believe will ultimately become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity, worth as much as $5 trillion worldwide by 2050.\nTesla's slumping vehicle sales and a sky-high price-to-earnings ratio of 300 times full-year earnings estimates can be hard pills to swallow. That's understandable. That said, Tesla has long been a story stock, a bet on Elon Musk, which has (so far) produced life-changing investment returns for shareholders over time. Tesla has split its stock multiple times in its history. Shares currently trade at nearly $500, which could prompt the company to issue another split sooner rather than later.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?

      "Content": "Is Lucid Group Stock Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire?\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LCID\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Upstart EV maker Lucid has just introduced a mid-size version of its all-electric SUV.\nLucid's production is growing quickly, but it is still far below that of other auto makers.\nThe company was able to increase its access to capital, but still has limited room to run.\n10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›\n\nInvestors who miss out on a huge investment opportunity often look for similar companies that have the potential to do well, too. That's exactly the story in the electric vehicle space, with Tesla being the huge missed opportunity and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) being a similar company with potential. Only potential isn't enough to make a stock a good investment.\nIs Lucid stock your ticket to becoming a millionaire, or is it too far behind in the electric vehicle (EV) space to catch up? The risk versus reward balance here is tilted materially in one direction.\nThe big news about Lucid Lucid makes highly respected EVs with award-winning technology. To be sure, that's a great foundation for the business. The problem is that, like Tesla before it, the company has started at the high end of the auto market . There are only so many customers capable of buying expensive cars. The most recent launch from the company, the Lucid Gravity Touring, is no exception.\nThis mid-size SUV starts at a hefty $79,000. Lucid has plans to start selling lower-priced vehicles, a path that is similar to that taken by Tesla. So there are reasons to be excited about Lucid's future. However, there's a lot more competition in the EV market today than there was when Tesla essentially created the EV category.\n\nBeing able to build a sustainably profitable business is far from a slam dunk for Lucid. In fact, while the new model is exciting, it may be too little, too late, given that EV sales have been weak since government subsidies were halted. Lucid may have simply missed the window of opportunity, and it may not have what it takes to remain a stand-alone business.\nThe income statement, the balance sheet, and production The first big problem is the income statement, which is mired in red ink. Lucid is a start-up building a business in a capital-intensive industry, so losses are to be expected. However, a company can only lose money for so long before it can no longer be sustained. The losses are expected to persist for the foreseeable future, making the balance sheet particularly important.\n\nThe balance sheet, however, is equally concerning. Without getting too deep into the numbers, Lucid started 2025 stating that it has enough liquidity to last until the first half of 2026. After a recent funding round, the company now believes it has enough liquidity to last until the first half of 2027. That's meant to assuage investor concerns about the company's access to capital.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, 2026 is around the corner, and this money-losing business is basically telling investors that it has a year to a year-and-a-half of money left. Unless you are an aggressive growth investor, that should be more than enough to keep you watching from the sidelines.\nThe other significant issue here is that Lucid's production is relatively modest by industry standards. The company highlighted in the third quarter of 2025 that its production is up materially from a year ago, rising by 116%. That's great, but it still only produced around 4,000 vehicles (generously rounding up). Tesla produced 447,000 vehicles (rounding down). Lucid simply doesn't have the scale it needs to compete effectively at this point.\n\nLucid has the tech, but it is high-risk To be fair, Lucid has attractive technology. That could be enough of an edge to break into the highly competitive auto industry. So there is a chance that an investment here could help you build a seven-figure nest egg. The problem is that Lucid has a long road ahead before it is likely to become sustainably profitable.\n\nThere are significant risks to consider, notably its ability to raise the cash it needs to continue supporting its money-losing business. Ultimately, only the most aggressive investors will be inclined to consider Lucid. And even then, the risk-reward balance seems highly skewed toward the negative.\nShould you buy stock in Lucid Group right now?

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nCondiciones y Política de privacidad\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Sources and ‌analysts said L&F had planned to supply the key materials for Tesla's in-house batteries known as 4680 cells.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled a plan in 2020 to mass-produce the 4680, a less expensive battery that he said would help it make a small, compelling $25,000 electric car that was fully autonomous within about three years from then.\nHowever, as EV ⁠demand slowed and Tesla struggled to ‌ramp up production and development of the 4680 cells, the company ultimately did not need as much cathode material from L&F as initially anticipated, analysts said.\nNeither Tesla nor L&F ‍immediately responded to Reuters' requests for comments.\nTesla currently uses the 4680 batteries in its slow-selling Cybertruck EVs, which have proved a major disappointment despite Musk’s prediction of hundreds of thousands of annual sales.\nMusk has also admitted it will be a challenge ​to scale up a new battery process called dry electrode used to make the cells.\n\nORDER CANCELLATION\nCho Hyun-ryul, ‌a senior analyst at Samsung Securities, said issues with production yields of Tesla's 4680 batteries and a slowdown in EV demand growth could have affected the reduction in orders from L&F. \"There (is) anxiety about the battery sector overall,\" he added.\nSome battery suppliers have reported order cancellations and ended or scaled down joint ventures with General Motors and Ford Motor following the end of U.S. federal subsidies for electric vehicles in September.\nIn recent weeks, South Korea's ⁠battery industry has come under mounting pressure as automakers scale back ​EV plans amid policy uncertainty and weakening demand.\nLG Energy Solution is ​set to lose about 13.5 trillion won ($9.41 billion) in expected revenue due to termination of battery supply deals from Ford and Freudenberg Battery Power Systems, more than half of its ‍25.62 trillion won in revenue ⁠last year.\n\nAnother South Korean battery maker, SK On, said this month it has decided to end its joint venture with Ford for their battery factories in the U.S.\nFord said it would take a $19.5 ⁠billion writedown and scrap several electric vehicle models, a dramatic example of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to ‌the Trump administration's policies and weakening EV demand.\n\nStory Continues\n($1 = 1,435.0100 won)\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang; ‌Editing by Christopher Cushing, Tom Hogue and Jan Harvey)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) has amassed a market cap of $1.6 trillion, making it the most valuable automaker in the world today, far exceeding the combined market capitalization of automakers like Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM ), BYD Co. Ltd. (OTC: BYDDY ) (OTC: BYDDF ) and more.\nIf you're curious about what the stock returns would be on TSLA if you invested $5,000 in the EV giant back during Christmas in 2020, here's how much you could've made.\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nTesla Stock Movements Since Dec. 24, 2020, Tesla stock has experienced record highs but also some sharp lows. If you invested $5,000 in Tesla around Christmas five years ago, when the stock was at approximately $220.59, it would buy you 22.66 shares in the company.\nBased on Tesla's Pre-Market trading figure, according to Benzinga Pro data as of December 23, 2025, where the stock is trading at $490.49, your investment today would be somewhere around $11111, a positive return of over 122% with a profit of $6111 on your initial investment.\n\nTesla, during the last five years, has hit a low of $101.81 on January 6, 2023, and recently hit a high of $498.83 on December 22, 2025.\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nTesla's Falling Sales Tesla, despite its valuation, has been reporting consistently declining sales this year, with the latest figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) showcasing a 28% YoY decline in the automaker's YTD sales in Europe, along with an almost 12% decline in sales during November. Tesla's rival BYD, on the other hand, surged almost 222% in November.\n\nThe lackluster sales come despite electrified vehicles (Hybrids, EVs and PHEVs) reporting a growth in the region and accounting for almost 63% of the total car sales in the region.\nShareholders Approve Trillion-Dollar Pay Package Tesla shareholders in November voted overwhelmingly in favor of a trillion-dollar pay package for Musk, which would reward Musk with compensation as the automaker hits crucial goals outlined by the Board of Directors in the pay package. However, it's worth noting that Musk could still pocket billions of dollars by hitting some of the relatively easier targets.\n\nMusk also received a major boost as a court in Delaware reversed its decision to void Musk's $56 billion pay package approved by investors in 2018. With the package now restored, Musk could gain over 18.1% stake in the company's expanded share base should he choose to exercise the stock options related to the 2018 compensation award.\n\nStory Continues\nRead Next:\nMissed Tesla?

That would give Tesla about 1.65 million sales for all of 2025, a drop of 7.7 percent and well below the level BYD had attained by end November.\nDeutsche Bank, which projects just 405,000 Tesla EV sales during the fourth quarter, sees the company's sales down by around one-third in both North America and Europe, and by one-tenth in China.\n\n- Transition period -\nIndustry watchers say it will take time for EV demand to reach a level of equilibrium in the United States following the elimination of the $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025.\nEven prior to that, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of Trump and other far-right politicians. Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies and from European giants.\n\"We believe Tesla will see some weakness on deliveries\" in the fourth quarter, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.\nSales of 420,000 would be \"good enough to show stable demand,\" with Wall Street \"laser focused on the autonomous chapter kicking off in 2026,\" Ives added, referring to plans for self-driving vehicles.\n\nEven as it has grown quickly, BYD has faced challenges in its home market.\nWith profitability in China weighed down by price-wary consumers, the company has sought to strengthen its foothold in foreign markets.\nBYD is \"one of the pioneers to establish overseas production capacity and supply chains for EVs,\" Jing Yang, Director of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings, told AFP.\n\"Going forward, its geographical diversification is likely to help it to navigate an increasingly complicated global tariff environment,\" said Yang.\n\nStory Continues\nOverseas rivals to BYD have balked at Chinese state subsidies and other state supports that have allowed the company to sell vehicles cheaply.\nTrump's predecessor Joe Biden imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports that could potentially go even higher under Trump. Europe has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, but BYD is building manufacturing capacity in Hungary.\n\nWhile the chance of Tesla reclaiming its global leadership in EVs looks uncertain, the American company is also potentially positioned for growth.\nMichaeli of TD Cowen sees autonomous technology playing an increasingly important role for Tesla, with breakthroughs in its \"full self-driving\" or \"FSD\" offerings potentially boosting sales.\n\"As Tesla really begins to roll out eyes-off features and expand FSDs capability, if they do that successfully, that should generate more demand for their vehicles,\" Michaeli said.\nMusk has said the Cybercab, an autonomous robotaxi model, will begin production in April 2026. The company has also unveiled lower-priced versions of the Models 3 and Y that could boost sales.\nbur-elm/msp\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Next Stock-Split Stock That Could Make You Rich\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:11 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is trading at a price where big tech peers have announced stock splits.\nIf Meta splits its stock, it could benefit from increased liquidity and broader investor participation.\nWith nearly 3.5 billion daily active users and aggressive capital investments in AI infrastructure, the company’s core digital advertising business continues to grow at an impressive pace.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have soared 443% over the past three years, closing at $661.50 on Dec. 22. At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "2026 will be 'year of autonomous': Analyst on Tesla, Waymo robotaxis\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: LYFT\n\nTSLA\n\nUBER\n\nGOOG\n\n2026 is on the road to being the \"year of autonomous\" driving as Tesla ( TSLA ) and the Alphabet-owned Waymo ( GOOG , GOOGL ) seek to expand their robotaxi services to other major US cities.\nWedbush Securities managing director of equity research Scott Devitt weighs in on the biggest themes and investing plays around self-driving technology, and how he sees 2026 playing out for rideshare companies Uber ( UBER ) and Lyft ( LYFT ).\n\nCatch Scott Devitt's top three consumer internet stock picks heading into 2026.\nAlso watch Yahoo Finance's interview with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign associate professor Katherine Driggs-Campbell about the recent behavior shifts in autonomous vehicles' driving habits\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nSo talk to me a little bit about how you're seeing these themes going into 2026. Robo taxi, AI.\n00:10 Speaker B\nAutonomous is going to be it's going to be the year of autonomous. You know, frankly, particularly in the US with the expansion of Waymo into uh as many as 20 markets in 2026. Our estimate for uh Tesla is that it it enters 30 US markets by the end of 2026 and you're beginning to really see the early stages of a transition from uh human human-driven activity to one that's run by robots. and it's very exciting. It's good for society, it's good for um the health of consumers given that it lowers traffic uh deaths and uh and incidence rates. And so I think autonomous is something that could be a headwind for companies I cover, Lyft and Uber in some ways. Um could be beneficial in other ways and certainly will will be good for Waymo and Tesla. On the AI side, you know, a lot of the the benefits the past two to three years in terms of security prices have come with infrastructure plays. I think you're going to start to see a transition more towards use cases, the enterprise and consumer use cases. And um, you know, these things kind of being found in the wild now and starting to see the ability to quantify uh the returns. Meta's been an early beneficiary of incorporation of AI into the business. I think you'll see more companies as well in 26.\n02:08 Speaker A\nAnd looking at Lyft and Uber, I mean, Uber has done well this year. Uh and I'm curious, is that because of robo taxi uh and and how you see the competition between some of these players uh shaking out? I mean, you've got Waymo that has done so well, and then you've got Tesla that is also making advancements and Tesla which touched all-time highs this year. So I I guess I'm just curious as to how you see it all shaking out within those players.\n02:44 Speaker B\nSo Uber and the performance year to date, it's a little tricky because it did underperform exiting 2024 on fears of autonomous and then recovered this year as it, you know, as autonomous has has been, you know, uh held at bay and hasn't really impacted anyone's business quite yet. And so I I think that that that performance looked over an extended period of time called the next 18 months, Uber's been relatively flat. You know, I think Uber as a company is a bit more insulated than Lyft because it has a delivery business for restaurants as well, which is about half of the gross bookings, and also has a significant business outside the US. In the US, you know, autonomous is ramping quickly and I think it's going only going to accelerate on an S-curve type uh pattern in 2026 and that really exposes Lyft which has over 90% of its gross bookings in the US and and so I think that you're going to start to see the effects of that in the share price which has also done well um this year in 25 could come to an end in 26.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Santa Claus Rally, Fed Minutes and Other Can't Miss Items this Week\n\nGavin McMaster\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMarkets enter the final week of 2025 with focus on the traditional \"Santa Claus Rally\" period that historically sees stocks gain during the last five trading days of December and first two days of January. The week features an abbreviated trading calendar with markets closed Thursday for New Year's Day and light volume expected throughout as institutional participation remains reduced following the Christmas break. Tuesday's FOMC meeting minutes will provide the only major catalyst, offering detailed insights into the Federal Reserve's December policy deliberations and the internal debates that shaped the more hawkish 2026 outlook. Economic data remains sparse with Wednesday's initial jobless claims and Chicago PMI before the holiday, followed by Friday's Manufacturing PMI providing the first economic snapshot of 2026. The week also brings heightened attention to Tesla (TSLA) as CEO Elon Musk's year-end deadline approaches for delivering unsupervised robotaxis in Austin, Texas—a promise that could prove consequential for the stock despite Musk's decade-long history of overly optimistic self-driving timelines.\n\nHere are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.\nMore News from Barchart The Next Market Collapse Will Be Quiet And That Is Exactly Why Investors Will Miss It\nNvidia Stock Is ‘Ripe’ for Gains in 2026, According to This Top Analyst\nThe Saturday Spread: Using Risk Topography to Plan Your Options Strategies (JD, NTAP, ZS)\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nSanta Claus Rally Dynamics and Year-End Positioning\nThe traditional Santa Claus Rally period encompasses the final five trading days of 2025 (December 26, 29, 30, 31, and January 2) and represents one of the most closely watched seasonal patterns in market history. Since 1969, the S&P 500 ($SPX) (SPY) has averaged gains of 1.3% during this seven-day period, with positive returns occurring roughly 78% of the time. The phenomenon is attributed to various factors including year-end portfolio adjustments, tax-loss harvesting completion, pension fund rebalancing, and general holiday optimism. However, this year faces headwinds from the Fed's more hawkish December meeting, persistent inflation concerns, and recent technology sector weakness following disappointing AI infrastructure earnings. Light volume during the period can amplify moves in either direction, making technical levels less reliable while creating potential for momentum-driven rallies or selloffs with limited fundamental justification. Historically, years where the Santa Claus Rally fails to materialize have often preceded weaker performance in the following year, making this week's price action potentially significant for early 2026 sentiment. Window-dressing activity by fund managers seeking to show winning positions in year-end reports may provide technical support for market leaders.\n\nStory Continues\nFOMC Minutes: Decoding the Hawkish Shift\nTuesday's FOMC meeting minutes at 2:00pm represent the week's most important fundamental catalyst, providing detailed insights into the Federal Reserve's December deliberations that resulted in a rate cut coupled with fewer projected cuts for 2026. The minutes will be scrutinized for any discussion about the conditions that would warrant pausing the cutting cycle, concerns about persistent inflation, and assessments of labor market resilience that shaped the more cautious outlook. Investors will search for clues about the internal debate among Fed officials, particularly any dissenting views about the December cut or disagreements about the 2026 policy path. The minutes may reveal how policymakers are weighing conflicting economic signals, including sticky inflation against labor market softening and consumer spending resilience. Any commentary about financial conditions, asset price levels, or concerns about reigniting inflation through excessive accommodation could influence market expectations for the pace of future policy adjustments. The release during a holiday-shortened week with reduced liquidity creates potential for amplified reactions to any hawkish or dovish revelations, particularly if the minutes contradict or significantly expand on Chair Powell's press conference messaging.\n\nTesla's Robotaxi Deadline and Autonomous Driving Reality\nThe year-end arrival brings intense focus on Tesla (TSLA) as CEO Elon Musk's deadline approaches for delivering unsupervised robotaxis in Austin, Texas—a promise that represents his most specific self-driving timeline despite a decade of missed predictions. Musk has raised the stakes by committing to such a near-term deliverable rather than using his typical \"this year\" or \"next year\" language that allows for perpetual postponement. Any successful demonstration of truly unsupervised autonomous operation would represent a watershed moment for Tesla's valuation thesis and the broader autonomous vehicle industry, potentially validating the company's massive investments in Full Self-Driving technology. However, skepticism remains high given Musk's track record of overly optimistic timelines and the significant regulatory, safety, and technical hurdles that remain for Level 4 autonomous operation. Even if Tesla demonstrates some form of unsupervised operation in a limited Austin geofence, questions will immediately arise about scalability, regulatory approval pathways, and commercialization timelines. The market's reaction to any announcements or lack thereof will provide important signals about investor willingness to continue valuing Tesla's autonomous ambitions at premium multiples heading into 2026.\n\nEconomic Indicators and 2026 Setup\nWednesday's initial jobless claims and Chicago PMI before the New Year's Day holiday will provide final 2025 economic data points, while Friday's Manufacturing PMI represents the first economic snapshot of 2026. The Chicago PMI has historically served as a reliable indicator of national ISM Manufacturing trends and will offer insights into industrial sector conditions and pricing pressures as the year concludes. Initial jobless claims continue tracking labor market health amid ongoing questions about employment momentum and the sustainability of consumer spending. Friday's Manufacturing PMI will be closely watched for any signs of industrial sector strengthening or deterioration entering the new year, with particular focus on new orders and employment components that provide forward-looking perspectives. The sparse economic calendar reflects the holiday period but these few releases will help establish baseline expectations for January's more comprehensive data. Any significant surprises could influence early 2026 positioning as institutional participants return from holiday breaks and begin implementing new year strategies based on evolving economic fundamentals.\n\nTransition Week: 2025 Review and 2026 Outlook\nThe year-end week provides natural opportunity to assess 2025's market performance and establish frameworks for 2026 positioning. Technology stocks, particularly AI-related infrastructure plays, have driven much of the year's gains despite recent volatility raising questions about sustainability. The Federal Reserve successfully transitioned from hiking to cutting while avoiding recession, though persistent inflation and the more cautious 2026 outlook create uncertainty about the policy path ahead. Key themes likely to dominate early 2026 include AI monetization and return on investment, inflation trajectory and Fed policy response, consumer spending resilience amid economic uncertainties, and geopolitical developments including potential trade policy shifts. The light volume environment during this transition week means meaningful price discovery will be limited until institutional participation returns in early January. Investors should use this period to review portfolio positioning, assess risk exposures, and develop strategic frameworks for navigating 2026's opportunities and challenges rather than reacting to potentially meaningless holiday-period price fluctuations in thin markets.\nBest of luck this week and don't forget to check out my daily options article.\nOn the date of publication, Gavin McMaster had a position in: SPY.

      "Content": "How Much It Really Costs To Own a Tesla vs. a Toyota Over 10 Years\n\nNicholas Morine\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:41 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTM\n\nHMC\n\nWith Tesla pushing hard into the more affordable vehicle market in attempt to counteract the end of the federal EV tax credit, as Electrek detailed, the question of whether it’s actually more affordable to drop a bit more on a Tesla than more traditional vehicle brands (such as, for example Honda or Toyota) comes to the fore.\n\nPitting Toyota versus Tesla has never seem more ripe a comparison as EVs compete against traditional internal combustion engines (ICE) and hybrid models, and the primary question most have in mind is: How much does it actually cost to run both for a decade? Let’s take a look at the numbers.\nRead More: Which Cars Last Longest? Ranking 32 Brands\nFind Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nBaseline Cost Assumptions and Annual Driving Ranges To set the standard, we’ll assume that drivers are racking up 12,000 miles a year (or 120,000 miles over the course of the decade), that electricity will cost 17.6 cents per kWh (per the EIA ), and that gasoline will cost a U.S. average of $3.10 a gallon (according to the same source ). Depreciation and insurance numbers are drawn from the latest AAA Your Driving Costs report for 2025 .\n\n2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD Concerning the Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, the stated fuel economy measures out to 26 kWh per 100 miles of range, meaning that a total of 312,000 kWh would be necessary over 10 years of use. At today’s energy costs, that comes out to about $5,497, not accounting for any loss of energy during the charging process.\n\nAAA figures the 10-year total cost of operation (TCO), inclusive of the gas figures above in addition to depreciation, maintenance and insurance, at $55,714 for the Tesla Model 3 LR AWD.\n2024 Toyota bZ4X FWD Toyota’s smaller EV SUV might be a little more expensive to operate than it’s closest Tesla competitor, but not by much. With an average fuel economy of 28 kWh per 100 miles of operation, the cost to drive this Japanese import 120,000 miles over a decade evens out to about $5,920.\nAAA’s numbers point to a 10-year TCO of $56,662 for the Toyota bZ4X, slightly higher than the Tesla alternative.\n\n2025 Toyota Corolla The Toyota Corolla is perhaps one of the most iconic ICE vehicles to hit the roads since its U.S. debut in 1968, but can it hold its own against the newcomer EVs in terms of operating costs ?\nWith an average mileage pegged at 36 mpg by Edmunds , gas is definitely going to outpace electricity in terms of fuel costs — the Corolla is estimated to cost drivers $1,033 per year, or $10,333 over a decade, at the pump.\nHowever: AAA’s fact sheet figures can be used to determine a decade-spanning TCO of $52,218 for the 2025 Corolla, coming in slightly under the EV alternatives.\n\nStory Continues\nFor a more broad-based snapshot based on categories rather than brands, consider figures from AAA. They suggest that it costs $13,692 per year to own a medium EV sedan versus $9,956 per year to own a medium ICE sedan, based on 15,000 miles driven. The largest portion of discrepancy is the very steep depreciation curve for EVs at this point in time.\n\nOn SUVs, the numbers are much closer — $12,710 per year for an electric medium SUV, and $12,584 per year for a medium ICE SUV. The above AAA figures include depreciation, insurance, fuel, maintenance, financing charges, and licensing, registration and taxes.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nTrump's $2K Dividend: Who Qualifies and How You'll Get It\nElon Musk Predicts 'Universal High Income' Will Pay For Everything -- How Much Would You Get?\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : How Much It Really Costs To Own a Tesla vs. a Toyota Over 10 Years\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $2 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTSLA\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom each have market caps around $1.6 trillion.\nAI is the driving force behind all three stock prices.\nOne of these tech leaders is seeing immediate results from AI spending, and its stock valuation is more attractive right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is responsible for adding trillions of dollars in value to a handful of companies over the last few years. Nvidia , for example, briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year, thanks to its dominant position in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). Four other companies sit firmly above the $2 trillion threshold as we approach the new year.\nBut three AI stocks currently have similar market caps around $1.6 trillion as of this writing, and are vying to become the first new $2 trillion company of 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Here's my prediction for the next company to top the milestone, and it could come as soon as next year.\nArtificial intelligence is fueling all three Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom have all seen their stock prices heavily influenced by advances in AI this year.\nMeta stock climbed higher early in the year as its efforts to improve its recommendation algorithms bore fruit. Ad revenue climbed higher as time spent on its apps increased, and ads became more effective. However, the stock took a step back recently as management shared plans to increase its AI-related spending.\n\nTesla's value is heavily tied to its robotaxi service and AI innovations. The stock received a boost over the summer when it launched its robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas. Investors added to those gains on promising progress on the company's next-generation AI chip for its vehicles.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator business has gained momentum in 2025, as the company signed big contracts with OpenAI and Anthropic, the latter of which is buying Alphabet 's Broadcom-designed tensor processing units (TPUs). To that end, Alphabet and Broadcom are seeing excellent progress in shifting more developer workloads to TPUs, which offer greater energy efficiency and cost savings versus Nvidia's GPUs.\nBroadcom stock took a step back after its last earnings report, as many analysts were disappointed with management's expectation that greater AI chip sales would come at a lower gross margin.\nWhile all three of these stocks have a path to a $2 trillion valuation in 2026, I expect Meta Platforms to reach the milestone first. Here's why.\n\nStory Continues\nAI-powered earnings growth at an attractive valuation Even with its run rate of $200 billion in annual revenue, Meta is still growing its bottom line quickly. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 20% in the third quarter, and improvements in AI are the reason.\nMeta has seen an increase in both ad impressions and price per ad for eight straight quarters. That indicates that it's increasing user engagement and opening new places within its apps for advertising while making ads more effective.\n\nManagement attributes a shift in its recommendation algorithm to make it more general across formats as the primary reason users are spending more time on its apps. Meta has seen similar improvements by applying the same methodology to its advertising algorithm. In other words, bigger models have directly translated into more revenue.\nThat trend should continue in 2026, as Meta opens up more opportunities for advertising, including on Threads and WhatsApp. It could also begin monetizing Meta AI, its generative AI chatbot. The improvements in its algorithms over the last couple of years should enable it to ramp up advertising quickly without as much negative impact on its pricing as we've seen in the past.\nThe bigger opportunity for Meta in 2026, though, may be the expansion of its generative AI features. It's reportedly working on an AI agent that can manage advertising campaigns for small businesses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly talks about the opportunity to handle everything involved with creating, testing, and optimizing ad campaigns on its platform through an AI agent.\n\nAnd chatbots specializing in sales and customer service for a company could open the door for more businesses to push Facebook and Instagram users to start messaging them through Meta's chat apps.\nWith small- and medium-sized businesses accounting for the bulk of advertisers on Meta's platform, these innovations have the potential to dramatically increase the amount they're willing to spend on ads. If the overhead for these clients is much lower, they can increase their ad spending and scale up their businesses faster.\nThose efforts should fuel another year of strong revenue growth. And while depreciation expense from the increase in AI-related capital expenditures could eat into earnings growth, Meta should be able to manage continued improvements in earnings per share with the help of share repurchases.\n\nThe stock trades for just 26 times forward earnings expectations, which is much lower than Broadcom's multiple and less than one-tenth the multiple Tesla stock trades for. I expect Meta to fetch a higher earnings multiple as it proves its AI spending to be well worth it once again in 2026, pushing its valuation to $2 trillion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "As Tesla Faces a New Investigation Over Door Safety, How Should You Play TSLA Stock Heading into 2026?\n\nNauman Khan\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla (TSLA) is no longer just an automaker, it’s a market-moving technology name whose share price often swings on product news, regulatory headlines, and CEO sentiment.\nRecently, Tesla was again in the news after U.S. auto-safety regulators opened an investigation into about 179,000 Model 3 sedans following a consumer petition alleging that the mechanical emergency door release can be difficult to locate and use in emergencies. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the issue could pose safety risks if occupants are unable to exit the vehicle after a crash. The probe has pushed Tesla back into the regulatory spotlight just as its shares hover near record highs.\n\nMore News from Barchart Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\nAnalysts note that if a defect is confirmed, Tesla could face costly recalls or fixes, e.g., retrofitting clearer manual releases, which would weigh on near-term profits. This investigation ties into broader negative headlines, notably a lawsuit filed by victims’ families over a fatal 2016 Model S crash blamed on door-handle design.\n\nWith 2026 on the horizon, investors are now weighing whether this latest scrutiny is a short-term setback or a meaningful signal for how to position TSLA stock going forward.\nTesla Stock Performance Tesla remains one of the most closely watched growth stocks in the market, backed by its scale, brand strength, and long-term ambitions in AI, autonomy, and energy. Shares of Tesla have moved up and down a lot, as investor mood keeps changing. Even with this volatility, the electric-vehicle maker has still managed to deliver decent performance so far in 2025. Year-to-date (YTD) stock is up 17.67%. Investors cheered on record vehicle deliveries, strong free cash flow, optimism around robotaxis and AI initiatives, renewed confidence in Full Self-Driving, and enthusiasm following Elon Musk’s updated long-term vision.\n\nHowever, the main concern of analysts about Tesla is its valuation, which is significantly stretched compared to its sector peers. The Price to Earnings (P/E) non-GAAP forward ratio is 296.40, vastly higher than the sector median of 17.77, indicating that the stock is trading at nose-bleed levels. In short, TSLA trades at a steep premium, but bulls argue future technology like robotaxis and FSD justifies this premium, while skeptics see it as pricing in lofty, uncertain outcomes.\nTesla Delivered Mixed Q3 Tesla’s latest quarterly results for Q3 2025 showed strong deliveries and cash generation, even as profitability came under pressure.\n\nStory Continues\nRevenue reached about $28.1 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. Automotive sales contributed roughly $21.2 billion, while the energy storage business continued to shine with revenue of about $3.4 billion, and services brought in around $3.5 billion.\nNet income came in at $1.37 billion, down 37% year-over-year (YOY), reflecting higher costs and lower regulatory credit revenue.\n\nOperating cash flow remained strong at $6.24 billion, and after capital spending of $2.25 billion, free cash flow hit a record $3.99 billion. Tesla ended the quarter with about $41.6 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nManagement offered limited formal guidance, but CFO Vaibhav Taneja said capital spending is expected to be around $9 billion for 2025, with a larger increase planned in 2026 to support AI and expansion efforts.\nWall Street expects full-year 2025 revenue of roughly $94.9 billion and earnings of about $1.13 per share, pointing to continued pressure on profitability.\nStill, Elon Musk struck an optimistic tone, saying the company is laying the foundation for long-term growth. CFO Vaibhav Taneja highlighted progress on the “Year of the Y,” noting that multiple Model Y variants helped support demand and keep volumes resilient despite a challenging environment.\n\nHeadwinds Grow, Hopes Remain Tesla is navigating a challenging market as its U.S. retail sales plunged 23% in November to a near four-year low of 39,800 vehicles, despite introducing lower-priced “Standard” variants. Cox Automotive analysts warned that demand for these cheap trims cannibalized higher-margin models, highlighting waning consumer interest after federal credits ended.\n\nIn Europe, stiff competition also chipped away at Tesla’s market share. On the positive side, Tesla’s robotaxi program quietly expanded achieving driverless rides in Austin and regulatory fixes like labeling hidden door releases have been rolled out. However, public controversies – including Musk’s political comments – have drawn protests that analysts say hurt Tesla’s brand.\nWall Street Divided on Tesla Stock Perspective Wall Street analysts remain divided on TSLA. On the one side, bulls remained hopeful, but others showed caution on steep valuation.\nMorgan Stanley’s Andrew Percoco recently shifted Tesla to “Equal-Weight” but raised his price target to $425 from $410, saying the stock deserves a premium despite a choppy outlook.\n\nGoldman Sachs maintains a Neutral rating with a $400 target, noting progress in autonomous technology but warning that much optimism is already priced in.\nBullish firms like Wedbush continue to rate Tesla Outperform, with a $600 target, while Deutsche Bank recently upgraded the stock to “Buy” and lifted its target to $500.\nOverall, the consensus price target is $395.32, with a “Hold” rating from all 40 analysts covering Tesla. This means stock is trading much above its mean target and has 16.8% downside risk here. But the bulls' target of $600 shows a 26.27% upside if Tesla delivers stronger vehicle deliveries, improved margins, and progress on robotaxi and AI initiatives in 2026.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Peter Thiel and Larry Page are preparing to flee California in case the state passes a billionaire wealth tax, report says\n\nJason Ma\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 12:38 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSLA\n\nTech billionaires are making plans to bail on California ahead a possible ballot measure that would tax their assets to help pay for healthcare.\nSources told the New York Times that venture capitalist Peter Thiel has explored spending more time outside California and opening an office for his Los Angeles-based personal investment firm, Thiel Capital, in another state.\n\nMeanwhile, Google cofounder Larry Page has discussed leaving the state by year&#8217;s end, sources told the Times , while three limited liability companies associated with him have filed documents to incorporate in Florida.\nThe Thiel Foundation and Google parent Alphabet didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Thiel and Page did not respond to the Times .\nTech investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned on the risk of a wealth tax in California, saying it will eventually bankrupt the state.\n&#8220;The inevitable outcome will be an exodus of the state’s most talented entrepreneurs who can and will choose to build their companies in less regressive states,&#8221; he posted on X on Monday. &#8220;All that will be left behind is the middle class. The tax burden, then, will fall to the middle class because after the &#8216;richest&#8217; choose to leave, the middle class are both (a) the only ones left and (b) are the largest source of state income to extract taxes from.&#8221;\n\nOn Friday, he posted in a reply to Sen.

Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is also considered a top presidential hopeful, has come out against it.\n\nCompanies have already been leaving California for places with lower taxes and less red tape.

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Here's Why Rivian Stock Is a Buy Before Jan. 1, 2026\n\nRyan Vanzo, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Rivian is a bona fide AI stock.\nSales could skyrocket next year thanks to new, cheaper models in its EV lineup.\n10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›\nShares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) languished for most of 2025. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 1, the company's stock price barely budged, although there were sporadic ups and downs along the way. Over the past month or so, however, shares have skyrocketed in value by more than 40%.\n\nI have been urging investors to take a closer look at Rivian stock all year. In many ways, the company appears to have the potential to become the next Tesla . Even after the latest price spike, shares still appear to be a long-term buy for several reasons, the most significant of which is expected to see serious progress in 2026.\nInvestors finally realize Rivian is an AI stock Take a quick look at Tesla's valuation and you'll realize that its stock is priced at a huge premium to nearly every other electric vehicle (EV) stock . It trades at a price-to-sales ratio of around 17. Rivian, meanwhile, trades at just 4.2 times sales.\nThere are many reasons for Tesla's premium. The company has a huge capital advantage, plus the best brand recognition in the industry. But it also has a leading position in robotaxis, a market that some experts believe will eventually be worth more than $5 trillion.\n\nThe robotaxi market looks like a high-tech business. But it's much more than that. Investors have been betting on autonomous-driving stocks for more than a decade.\nProgress has been slow. Cameras and detection devices cost a lot of money, and real-world testing has been limited due to safety and regulatory concerns. But artificial intelligence (AI) has vastly accelerated the timeline in recent years.\n\"There is a massive leap in AI happening right now, and it is resulting in smarter end-to-end AI systems that can learn much more efficiently, are interpretable, and can generalize to every possible scenario on the road,\" said Raquel Urtasun, the CEO of Waabi, a company that specializes in self-driving technology. \"These advances result in autonomous vehicles with superhuman capabilities that will enhance road safety and transform transportation as we know it.\"\n\nTesla has wisely invested heavily in AI, and investors have been keen to reward it for its efforts. In general, AI stocks have performed very well in 2025, so being lumped into that category has created direct gains for shareholders.\nFor most of the year, Rivian was not considered an AI stock. But I repeatedly pointed out how Rivian was also investing heavily into AI, just like Tesla. Rivian scheduled an AI day in early December, and shares seemingly started rising based on expectations.\n\nStory Continues\nExecutives largely delivered, with fresh updates on hands-free highway assist, point-to-point navigation, eyes-off alerts, and personal level 4 autonomy. Expect the EV maker's AI progress to continue to strengthen in 2026. But there's a catalyst I'm even more excited about over the near term.\nRivian will finally compete with Tesla next quarter Tesla has many vehicle models on the market. But its cheapest two models -- the Model Y and Model 3 -- account for more than 90% of its vehicle sales. To compete directly with Tesla, EV makers must have several impressive models priced under $50,000.\nThus far, few companies have achieved this feat. Most competing EVs are either too expensive or are priced cheaply with lackluster features and relatively minimal range.\n\nRivian currently has only two models on the road: the R1S and R1T. Both are priced above $70,000, significantly above what most consumers are willing to pay. But next quarter, production is expected to begin on the R2, its first model priced under $50,000. Two more models will follow: the R3 and R3X, both expected to be priced under $50,000.\nWithin a few months, Rivian could go from being a niche luxury automaker with AI upside to a legitimate Tesla competitor. More vehicles on the road give it more real-world data, further strengthening its AI.\nEven after the recent share price run-up, Rivian still has a market cap of less than $30 billion. Compare that to Tesla's $1.5 trillion valuation, and the long-term upside in Rivian stock becomes clear.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now? Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Elon Musk Predicts A New Economy: No Poverty, No Hunger And Work Is Optional\n\nErica Kollmann\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:01 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk has often shared a radical vision for the future of the global economy, suggesting that humanity is on the brink of a “post-scarcity” era characterized by the end of poverty and the elimination of labor.\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, he suggested that “applied intelligence” could trigger double-digit economic growth in the near term and triple-digit growth within five years.\n“Double-digit growth is coming within 12 to 18 months. If applied intelligence is proxy for economic growth, which it should be, triple-digit is possible in ~5 years,” he said on X.\nMusk basically predicted the end of the industrial age and the beginning of an “intelligence age” defined by abundance.\nDon't Miss:\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\n“Applied Intelligence” Musk's theory is based on the idea that AI—specifically artificial general intelligence (AGI) and autonomous robotics—is the ultimate hack for productivity.\nIn standard economics, growth is limited by labor and capital. However, if AI can be scaled like software and embodied in hardware (like the Optimus robot), the cost of labor collapses toward the cost of electricity.\n\nNear-term (12-18 months): Double-digit growth (10%+) would be unprecedented for a developed economy like the U.S., which typically grows at 2-3%. This rate and timeframe suggests Musk expects immediate, massive efficiency gains from AI integration.\nLong-term (~5 years): Triple-digit growth (100%+) implies a doubling of the economy annually. This is mathematically transformative, suggesting a world where goods and services are produced so rapidly and cheaply that the GDP metric itself might become obsolete.\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nSkepticism Vs. Vision Critics argue that Musk's proposed timelines ignore realistic physical and regulatory hurdles.\nReal-world economic growth requires energy infrastructure, raw materials and global supply chains, none of which can scale at the speed of code.\nEven if intelligence is infinite, the lithium for batteries and the copper for power grids are not. Other inventions that transformed society, like steam or electricity, took decades to move the needle on national GDP.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, if Musk is even partially correct, the primary challenge for society will shift from “how do we create wealth?” to “how do we distribute it?” in an era where human labor is no longer the primary driver of value.\nRead Next:\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nHave $100k+ to invest?

      "Content": "Analysis-Waymo's San Francisco outage raises doubts over robotaxi readiness during crises\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPCG\n\nTSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A widespread power outage in San Francisco that led to Waymo robotaxis stalling and snarling traffic earlier this month has raised concerns about the readiness of autonomous vehicle operators to tackle major emergencies like earthquakes and floods.\nDriverless taxis from Alphabet unit ​Waymo, a ubiquitous feature on the city's streets, were stuck at intersections with their hazard lights turned on as traffic lights stopped working following a fire ‌at a PG&E substation that knocked out power to roughly one-third of the city on December 20, videos posted on social media showed. Waymo halted operations, resuming a day later.\n\nThe incident has renewed calls for ‌stricter regulation of the nascent but fast-growing industry as other companies including Tesla and Amazon's Zoox race to expand robotaxi services in several cities.\n\"If you get a response to a blackout wrong, regulators are derelict if they do not respond to that by requiring some sort of proof that the earthquake scenario will be handled properly,\" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Waymo said that while its robotaxis are designed to handle non-operational traffic signals as four-way stops, they occasionally request a ⁠confirmation check. Though the vehicles successfully traversed more than 7,000 ‌darkened signals on Saturday, \"the outage created a concentrated spike\" in confirmation requests that \"led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets,\" Waymo said.\n\nRobotaxi operators around the globe use remote access by humans - known in the industry as \"teleoperation\" - in varying degrees to monitor and control ‍vehicles. Waymo, for example, has a team of human \"fleet response\" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver, its bot, when it encounters a particular situation.\nBut such remote assistance has its limitations, and the Waymo outage highlights the need to regulate how robotaxi operators use the technology, said Missy Cummings, director of the George Mason University Autonomy and Robotics Center and former adviser to ​the U.S. road safety regulator.\n\"The whole point of having remote operations is for humans to be there when the system is not responsive in the way it should ‌be,\" she said. \"The federal government needs to regulate remote operations,\" Cummings said. \"They need to make sure that there's backup remote operations when there's some kind of catastrophic failure.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCalifornia's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulate and issue permits for the testing and commercial deployment of robotaxis, have said they are looking into the incident.\nThe DMV said it was talking to Waymo and other autonomous vehicle makers about actions related to emergency response. It also said it was formulating regulations to ensure remote drivers \"meet high standards for safety, accountability and responsiveness.\"\n\n'A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW'\nDeploying and commercializing fully autonomous vehicles have been harder than expected with high investments to ensure the technology is ⁠safe and public outcry after collisions forcing many to shut shop.\nFollowing a high-profile accident in 2023 ​when a robotaxi from General Motors' Cruise dragged a pedestrian, regulators revoked its permit, eventually leading the ​company to cease operations.\nBut robotaxis have returned to the spotlight with Tesla rolling out its service in Austin, Texas earlier this year and CEO Elon Musk promising rapid expansion. Waymo, which has grown slowly and steadily over the years since its launch as Google's self-driving project in ‍2009, has also accelerated expansion.\nWith a fleet of ⁠more than 2,500 vehicles, Waymo operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Metro Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe company said the confirmation processes its vehicles follow were established during early deployment and that it was now refining them to match its current scale. Waymo is implementing fleet-wide updates that provide vehicles with \"specific ⁠power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.\"\nBoth Cummings and Koopman said robotaxi operators should face additional permitting requirements once their fleets grow beyond a certain size to ensure that they have adequate ‌capabilities to deal with large-scale failures.\n\"If this had been an earthquake, it would have been a problem,\" Koopman said. \"This is just a shot across ‌the bow.\"\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Alistair Bell)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But with thin trading volume, investors won&rsquo;t really know if that rally will take shape until next week.\nEither way, investors continue to climb the wall of worry that includes tariffs, inflation, jobs, and the potential bubble in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Much of this is due to the relative strength of the consumer, which will continue to be something to watch in 2026.\n\nNext week will be another shortened trading week. Markets will be closed on Jan. 1. This is a time for many investors to step away, but the MarketBeat analysts will continue to stay on top of the stocks and stories moving the market. Here are some of our most popular stories from this week.\n&rarr; Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\nEarnings season is the time when many companies announce share buyback activity. This week, Thomas Hughes highlighted five companies that have some of the most aggressive share buyback programs and why those buybacks may drive stock price growth in 2026.\n&rarr; These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nHow do you know when a dividend stock is a keeper? This week, Hughes highlighted three companies that are raising their dividends within an environment where analyst sentiment continues to be bullish, suggesting capital growth to go along with that dividend growth.\n\nDarden Restaurants Inc. (NYSE: DRI) had a strong earnings report, but DRI stock has pulled back since the report. Hughes explained why investors should view this as a strong buying signal based on strong technical signals as well as bullish sentiment from analysts and institutions.\n&rarr; MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a volatile stock in 2025, but Sam Quirke explained why the stock continues to have a bullish upside. In his latest article, Quirke explained why a recent failed pullback is likely to be the catalyst for the TSLA share price to move above $500.\nQuirke was also examining the recent price action in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). The reminder to investors is that, in periods of consolidation, watch what analysts are signaling, which in this case suggests bullish upside for AMZN stock.\n\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nThe S&P 500 has continued to make new highs. However, investors may want to watch the Russell 2000, which has been outpacing the market and could signal a surge in small-cap stocks. This week, Chris Markoch made a case for five small-cap stocks that could benefit as investors rotate out of big tech.\n\nStory Continues\nPalantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) has rallied from a recent sell-off. Markoch gave investors three reasons Palantir will continue to be an essential stock in the AI infrastructure trade.\nIt&rsquo;s been a brutal year for beer stocks. However, a recent report from Goldman Sachs suggests that 2026 may be a time for beer to make a comeback. If that&rsquo;s true, Markoch analyzed two brewers that could give investors a buzz in 2026.\n\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nRyan Hasson also looked at small-cap stocks this week by pointing investors to MarketBeat&rsquo;s list of the highest-rated small-cap stocks. Hasson highlighted the top five names on the list and explained the case for future growth.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the best-performing technology stocks of 2025. So, is the recent pullback a healthy pause or the first sign of a correction? Hasson argued for the buy-the-dip story based on technical signals and institutional conviction.\nArticles by Leo Miller\nMarkets are expected to remain volatile in 2026. That's why buying stocks of dividend growers could be a smart strategy. This week, Leo Miller highlighted three companies that have aggressively raised their dividends and why each offers investors a reason to believe in capital growth that drives a higher total return.\n\nOn Dec. 22, three companies began trading as part of the S&P 500 Index. This stamp of approval generally gives stocks a short-term pop, but Miller explained why each company may give investors reasons for a solid growth story in 2026.\nSpace stocks have been strong performers in 2025, but three of these names have had strong insider selling in the last 30 days. Miller reminded investors that not all insider selling is equal, and that only one company may be sending a concerning signal.\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nQuantum computing stocks have given off a &ldquo;hurry up and wait&rdquo; vibe in 2025. That can frustrate traders, but it may give risk-tolerant investors an opportunity to accumulate shares on every pullback. This week, Nathan Reiff provided investors with several reasons to believe that D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) could be setting up investors for a strong 2026.\n\nPrecious metals have been one of the strongest trades in 2025, and that strength is spreading to mining stocks. This may be a case where bigger is better, and Reiff highlighted three large miners with attractive setups for 2026.\nThe oil sector has been on the opposite side of the commodities trade.
