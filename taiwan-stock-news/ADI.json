      "Content": "Analog Devices (ADI) Registers a Bigger Fall Than the Market: Important Facts to Note\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nIn the latest trading session, Analog Devices (ADI) closed at $271.20, marking a -1.32% move from the previous day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.74%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.63%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.76%.\nComing into today, shares of the semiconductor maker had gained 0.68% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 0.14%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.79%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Analog Devices in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.28, showcasing a 39.88% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.11 billion, up 28.21% from the prior-year quarter.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $9.79 per share and a revenue of $12.82 billion, signifying shifts of +25.67% and +16.36%, respectively, from the last year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Analog Devices. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.52% higher. Analog Devices is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\nIn terms of valuation, Analog Devices is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.07. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 44.32 of its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, ADI's PEG ratio is currently 1.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.47.\nThe Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 31, which puts it in the top 13% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Buy 5 Solid Semiconductor Stocks of 2025 With Room for Growth in 2026\n\nRitujay Ghosh\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:10 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMTSI\n\nSLAB\n\nThe semiconductor market had a remarkable year, with more room to grow in 2026, thanks to robust demand from various industries and the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Semiconductor stocks, especially those focused on AI, have been responsible for the broader tech rally this year.\n\nA steady surge in sales throughout the year, along with hefty investment in AI, is fueling optimism that the semiconductor market could be poised for a strong run in 2026.\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in semiconductor stocks, such as Analog Devices ADI, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. MTSI, Silicon Laboratories Inc. SLAB and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, the final quarter of the year started on a high, with sales totaling $72.7 billion in October, increasing 4.7% sequentially and 27.2% year over year from October 2024&rsquo;s total of $57.2 billion.\n\nThe surge comes after a solid first and second quarter. Chip sales totaled $179.7 billion in the second quarter, a 7.8% rise from the first quarter. This follows a robust 2024, during which chip sales totaled $627.6 billion, representing a 19.1% increase from $526.8 billion in 2023.\nSemiconductor sales declined after the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the market remained stagnant till 2022. However, the sudden enthusiasm surrounding AI since the second half of 2023 saw semiconductor sales rebound.\nThis year has been impressive for microchips, with enthusiasm surrounding AI fueling demand. The AI sector remains vast and largely untapped, and major tech companies are pumping in billions of dollars while increasingly crediting AI-driven demand for their revenue growth.\n\nIndustry heavyweights, such as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and NVIDIA Corporation, have recently signed major AI deals that are widely expected to drive higher demand for semiconductors.\nSemiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI), in its Year-End Total Semiconductor Equipment Forecast&mdash;OEM Perspective report, has forecast global sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment by OEMs to hit a record $133 billion, as reported by BISinfotech. The report also forecasts sales to reach $145 billion in 2026 and $156 billion in 2027.\n\nStory Continues\n4 Semiconductor Stocks With Growth Potential Analog Devices Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (&ldquo;DSP&rdquo;) integrated circuits.

      "Content": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Analog Devices (ADI): Read This Before Placing a Bet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADI Check price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Analog Devices, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ADI Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $9.79.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI, Johnson & Johnson&rsquo;s JNJ, The Gap, Inc. GAP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop 5 High-Yield S&P 500 Stock to Buy for 2026\nThe U.S. stock market has experienced significant volatility at the beginning of 2025 owing to a multitude of factors. The trade policy framework undertaken in the new Trump administration has reshaped market sentiment. The aggressive tariff measures imposed by Washington on its major trading partners have left several businesses in a state of uncertainty. The growing Sino-U.S. trade tension was a concerning factor for investors. The U.S. government aims to limit Beijing&rsquo;s access to high-end technologies. It has imposed restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor tech to China.\nThe tariff-related uncertainties have significantly affected companies with a strong presence in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Moreover, the war in Europe and the Middle East has further aggravated the market uncertainty. These developments have led to rising manufacturing costs and supply chain issues, putting pressure on margins. However, there were some positive macroeconomic developments as well in 2025. The federal reserve rate cuts have lowered borrowing costs and improved corporate profitability.\n\nTrade-related risks and changes in monetary policy led to frequent stock price fluctuations. However, broader market momentum remained positive with tech stocks largely leading the bull run. Growing spending on AI infrastructure and digital transformation is driving growth in the tech sector. Despite a hike in energy prices, the overall annual inflation rate was lower than expected in 2025.\nKey Growth Drivers for 2026\nRapid AI buildouts are expected to be a key driver for businesses in 2026. Businesses in several industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, social ecommerce, telecom and others are rapidly incorporating AI across the portfolio to gain a competitive edge. However, this rapid AI build-out requires substantial computing infrastructure, data centers to support these AI workloads, as well as energy optimization and cooling technologies.\n\nStory Continues\nAI integration has become capex-heavy. There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.\n\nChina is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government&rsquo;s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.\nAmid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.\n\nKey Picks\nInternational Business Machines Corp. : Headquartered in Armonk, NY, IBM is a leading provider of cloud and data platforms.

Do they waste a whole day trying to find the next big play in AI or do they just say, you know what? Nvidia's going to win this whole damn thing? I'm just going to bet on them again next year.\n00:15 Adam\nYeah, I definitely wouldn't uh just bet on Nvidia. I I think you do need to do your homework if you want to buy specific names. I think probably the general investor is probably better finding some sort of basket to kind of play the overall space. Uh but we're very early innings in this and\n00:41 Adam\nobviously Nvidia is the winner right now, but uh to say, you know, in five years that we look back that they're going to be the dominant player still, very, very unlikely. Like I said, this is really an evolving space. So I I would be careful with something that's so specific as Nvidia. Uh we kind of like to barbell this with, you know, something like the the big hyperscaler like a like an Alphabet Google, uh because that's really the type of name that uh you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because they just\n01:14 Adam\noverall, the AI story is just benefiting an already existing business model that was doing well. So, I think you would just want to be careful with what we're calling kind of the one trick ponies, like a Nvidia, uh a Core Weve or a Patier right now.\n01:31 Speaker A\nUh, Brooke, let me get over to you because I think what you're seeing in industrial metals and some of the things that Adam's talking about fits nicely with what we heard from Ed Yardini this morning that he might see it is likely to see we are likely to see a broadening out in this rally. Investors doing their homework, trying to get outside of the tried and true Mag 7.\n01:53 Brooke\nYeah, Brian, what we did hear from Ed Danny over the weekend was really ongoing momentum in this market in 2026. He maintained that year end target for the S&P 500 of 7,700 and he said largely it won't be really led by uh the Mag 7, but also what he called the impressive 493 of the S&P 500 as really this broadening out, this boost in productivity growth really leads to overall returns for the\n02:26 Brooke\nS&P 500 in 2026. Specifically, you know, he went on to say that that is really where exactly investors should be thinking about this mindset. You know, not really overweight technology, but more so thinking about the other users of AI as opposed to just the producers of AI.

      "Content": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Is Using Debt Safely\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nDavid Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhen Is Debt A Problem? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Analog Devices Carry? The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at November 2025 Analog Devices had debt of US$8.60b, up from US$7.62b in one year. However, it also had US$3.65b in cash, and so its net debt is US$4.95b.\nHow Strong Is Analog Devices' Balance Sheet? According to the last reported balance sheet, Analog Devices had liabilities of US$3.25b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$10.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.65b in cash and US$1.44b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$9.09b.\n\nOf course, Analog Devices has a titanic market capitalization of US$135.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nStory Continues\nAnalog Devices's net debt is only 0.99 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 14.1 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, Analog Devices grew its EBIT by 45% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Analog Devices can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Analog Devices actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.\nOur View The good news is that Analog Devices's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. It looks Analog Devices has no trouble standing on its own two feet, and it has no reason to fear its lenders. For investing nerds like us its balance sheet is almost charming. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Analog Devices you should know about.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAnalog Devices, Inc. ADI, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Fortive Corp. FTV.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Buy 3 Tech Stocks as Santa Claus Rally Gets Underway The Santa Claus rally appears to have finally taken off, with tech stocks rebounding after a roller-coaster ride over the past month. Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. , Amazon.com, Inc. and Fortive Corp. , which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks with Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc.
