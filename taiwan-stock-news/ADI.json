      "Content": "Possible Bearish Signals With Analog Devices Insiders Disposing Stock\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nIn the last year, many Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Analog Devices Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the CEO & Chair of the Board of Directors, Vincent Roche, for US$5.1m worth of shares, at about US$255 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$278). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 14% of Vincent Roche's stake.\nInsiders in Analog Devices didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\nSee our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\nAnalog Devices Insiders Are Selling The Stock The last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Analog Devices shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$3.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nDoes Analog Devices Boast High Insider Ownership? For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Analog Devices insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$299m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Analog Devices Insiders? Insiders haven't bought Analog Devices stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Analog Devices is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Analog Devices you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Buy 3 Tech Stocks as Santa Rally Begins With a Record High S&P 500\n\nRitujay Ghosh\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nADI\n\nFTV\n\nThe Santa Claus rally appears to have finally taken off, with tech stocks rebounding after a roller-coaster ride over the past month. Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. ADI, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Fortive Corporation FTV, which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks With Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc. Analog Devices, Inc. is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. ADI&rsquo;s product line is composed of amplifiers and comparators; analog to digital converters; digital to analog converters; video encoders and decoders; embedded processing products and DSPs; MEMS and temperature sensors; RF/IF components and converters; power and thermal management ICs, audio/video converters, amplifiers, CODECs, filters and processors.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalog Devices&rsquo; expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 5.3% over the past 60 days. ADI currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\nAmazon.com, Inc. Amazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN&rsquo;s online retail business revolves around the Prime program, well-supported by the company&rsquo;s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish a footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 9.5% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.7% over the last 60 days. AMZN presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\nFortive Corporation Fortive Corporation is a diversified industrial growth company.

      "Content": "These 6 stocks will lead the $1 trillion chip surge in 2026, BofA says\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\nLRCX\n\nKLAC\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom isn't cooling off — it's getting bigger, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya contends.\nWhile AI skeptics have pointed to eye-popping valuations as a reason to run, Arya said the industry is only at the \"midpoint\" of a decade-long transformation, and it's being led by Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ).\n\nIn a report titled \"2026 Year Ahead: choppy, still cheerful,\" Arya forecast a 30% year-over-year surge in global semiconductor sales that will finally push the sector past a historic $1 trillion annual sales milestone in 2026.\nArya noted a strong belief in companies with \"moats that are quantified by their margin structure.\" In addition to Nvidia and Broadcom, he highlighted four other large-cap semiconductor companies — Lam Research ( LRCX ), KLA ( KLAC ), Analog Devices ( ADI ), and Cadence Design Systems ( CDNS ) — as his top picks for 2026.\n\"I often say that investing in semis is very simple,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call. \"You don't need any sell-side analyst to do that. Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?",

The company will serve professionals, enterprises, and public sector organizations across Jordan.

Its low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite solutions will enable reliable primary or back-up connectivity across the nation, allowing businesses and communities to operate more effectively and with confidence.\n\n\"Jordan, with its diverse economy and terrain, presents unique opportunities for latest-generation satellite broadband solutions that combine Starlink's LEO constellation with our local market expertise and value-add. Whether it is a classroom in Tafileh, a logistics convoy near Ma'an, or a refugee clinic in Mafraq, everyone can benefit from the same high-speed internet enjoyed in the capital, Amman,\" said Amit Somani, CEO of Sama X.\nSpaceX's Starlink advanced LEO satellite constellation is the most sophisticated internet system ever deployed. Since 2020, SpaceX has launched more LEO satellites than all other providers combined, building an unparalleled infrastructure that delivers fiber-like speeds without the constraints of traditional ground-based networks.\n\nIn addition to providing the world's most advanced satellite internet, Sama X offers turnkey solutions – from customer consultation to rapid installation and activation – as well as local support, including a 24/7 call center in both English and Arabic.\n\"We are thankful to Jordan's Telecommunications Regulatory Commission for establishing a conducive environment that allows companies like Sama X to operate effectively.

(AIM, TSX-V, NASDAQ Iceland: AMRQ, OTCQX: AMRQF), an independent mine development corporation focused on unlocking Greenland’s mineral potential, is pleased to announce the closing of the previously announced acquisitions of the entire issued share capital of Black Angel Mining A/S (“Black Angel”) from FBC Mining (BA) Limited (“FBC Mining”) and of the Kangerluarsuk licences from 80 Mile plc, (the “Acquisitions”) together creating the West Greenland Hub.\n\nAs consideration for the Acquisitions, the Company issued 7,654,222 common shares of the Company to FBC Mining (the “Black Angel Closing Shares”), and 392,939 common shares of the Company to 80 Mile plc (the “Kangerluarsuk Closing Shares”) (together the “Closing Shares”).\nAs previously announced, the acquisition of Black Angel represented a related party transaction for the purposes of AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies and Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"), and is also considered a transaction with a Non-Arm’s Length Party within the meaning of the TSX Venture Exchange (\"TSX-V\"), by virtue of the fact that the ultimate parent company of Black Angel, BAMAS ehf. (“BAMAS”), is controlled by certain directors of Amaroq.\n\nPursuant to MI 61-101, related party transactions require a formal valuation and minority shareholder approval unless exemptions from these requirements are available. With respect to the Black Angel acquisition, the Company is relying on the exemption from the formal valuation requirements and minority approval requirements in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a), respectively, of MI 61-101, as neither the fair market value of the subject matter of, nor the fair market value of the consideration for, the transaction, insofar as it involves interested parties, exceeds 25% of the Company’s market capitalisation.\nFollowing the issuance of the Closing Shares, the beneficial ownership in Amaroq shares of the directors who also hold an interest in FBC Mining will be as follows:\nDirector\nShares held (directly & indirectly)\n% of ISC\nEldur Olafsson\n16,031,691\n3.46\nSigurbjorn Thorkelsson\n13,616,139\n2.94\nGraham Stewart\n2,982,537\n0.64\n\nApplication has been made for the admission (“Admission”) of the Black Angel Closing Shares and the Kangerluarsuk Closing Shares to trading on (a) AIM; and (b) Icelandic Exchange. Admission is expected to take place on AIM at 8.00 a.m. GMT on 30 December 2025, on the Icelandic Exchange at 9.30 a.m. UTC on 30 December 2025. The listing of the Black Angel Closing Shares and the Kangerluarsuk Closing Shares on the TSX-V remains subject to the final approval of the TSX-V.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Black Angel Closing Shares and the Kangerluarsuk Closing Shares were issued to persons outside of Canada pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirements in Canada available under OSC Rule 72-503 – Distributions Outside Canada and, accordingly, the Black Angel Closing Shares and the Kangerluarsuk Closing Shares are not subject to a four-month hold period in Canada.\n\nThe Company also confirms that an additional 562,449 common shares of the Company were issued under the Company’s share-based incentive plans. None of the shares issued under these plans were allocated to PDMRs.\nFollowing the issue of common shares under the Company’s share-based incentive plans and the Closing Shares, the Company’s issued share capital will consist of 463,648,822 common shares of no par value, each carrying one voting right.\nGiven that the Company does not hold any common shares in treasury, this figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in interest in, the share capital of the Company.\nEnquiries:\nAmaroq Ltd.\nEd Westropp, Head of BD and Corporate Affairs\n+44 (0)7385 755711\newe@amaroqminerals.com\n\nEddie Wyvill, Corporate Development\n+44 (0)7713 126727\new@amaroqminerals.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Nominated Adviser and Corporate Broker)\nScott Mathieson\nFreddie Wooding\n+44 (0) 20 7886 2500\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Corporate Broker)\nJames Asensio\nHarry Rees\n+44 (0) 20 7523 8000\nCamarco (Financial PR)\nBilly Clegg\nElfie Kent\nFergus Young\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nFurther Information:\nAbout Amaroq\nAmaroq’s principal business objectives are the identification, acquisition, exploration, and development of gold and strategic metal properties in South Greenland.

The Supreme Court decided to dismiss the cassation appeals filed by TKM Grupp AS and KIA Auto AS and upheld the judgment of the Administrative Regional Court of 4 June 2025 (company announcement on June 6, 2025 ), which confirmed the Competition Council’s decision to impose a fine of EUR 135 thousand on KIA Auto AS, of which EUR 95 thousand was imposed jointly and severally on TKM Grupp AS. The judgment is final and cannot be appealed. TKM Grupp AS maintains its position that it has not violated competition law; however, KIA Auto AS will comply fully with the judgment and continue its normal business operations.\n\nThe proceedings began in August 2014 when the Latvian Competition Council notified TKM Grupp AS and KIA Auto AS of its decision to impose a fine for an alleged infringement of competition law. The Competition Council found that, under the warranty conditions applicable during the period 2004–2009, KIA car owners were required to carry out regular maintenance exclusively at KIA authorised service centres and to use only KIA original spare parts. TKM Grupp AS and KIA Auto AS disagreed with these findings and appealed the decision (company announcement dated September 16, 2014 ), arguing that the Competition Council had misinterpreted the warranty conditions and that TKM Grupp AS could not be held jointly or separately liable, as it is merely a holding company.\n\nAfter several years of litigation, on 22 nd of December 2021 the Supreme Court of Latvia referred the case back to the Administrative Regional Court for re-examination (company announcement dated December 22, 2021 ), emphasizing the need for a thorough analysis of the alleged anti-competitive conduct and its impact on the market, as well as verification of the Competition Council’s assessment and market analysis. In September 2022, the Regional Court suspended the proceedings at the request of the Competition Council to seek a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (company announcement dated September 15, 2022 ). The preliminary ruling was issued on 5 December 2024, clarifying that the Competition Council must demonstrate potential and sufficiently appreciable anti-competitive effects (company announcement dated December 5, 2024 ). Following receipt of the preliminary ruling, the Regional Court resumed the proceedings and, on 4 June 2025, upheld the Competition Council’s decision despite extensive explanations, submissions and additional evidence provided by KIA Auto AS and TKM Grupp AS. We turned to the Supreme Court for their assessment as we did not agree with the ruling of the regional court.\n\nLire la suite\nThe Supreme Court has now concluded that the Regional Court assessed the Competition Council’s decision in accordance with the guidance provided by the Court of Justice of the European Union and established significant potential anti-competitive effects and does not need to identify actual consequences. The Court also stated that the 100% shareholding of the parent company creates a presumption of decisive influence over the subsidiary’s conduct. Consequently, the Supreme Court found no grounds to initiate cassation proceedings.\nRaul Puusepp\nChairman of the Board\nPhone: +372 731 5000\ninfo@tkmgrupp.ee\n\nCGU et Politique de confidentialité\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The purpose of ING Bank is: empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. ING Bank’s more than 60,000 employees offer retail and wholesale banking services to customers in over 100 countries.\n\nING Group shares are listed on the exchanges of Amsterdam (INGA NA, INGA.AS), Brussels and on the New York Stock Exchange (ADRs: ING US, ING.N).\nING aims to put sustainability at the heart of what we do. Our policies and actions are assessed by independent research and ratings providers, which give updates on them annually. ING's ESG rating by MSCI has been upgraded from 'AA' to 'AAA' in October 2025. As of June 2025, in Sustainalytics’ view, ING’s management of ESG material risk is ‘Strong’ with an ESG risk rating of 18.0 (low risk). ING Group shares are also included in major sustainability and ESG index products of leading providers. Here are some examples: Euronext, STOXX, Morningstar and FTSE Russell. Society is transitioning to a low-carbon economy. So are our clients, and so is ING. We finance a lot of sustainable activities, but we still finance more that’s not.

      "Content": "Analog Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ADI) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nMost readers would already be aware that Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) stock increased significantly by 18% over the past month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Analog Devices' ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:\n6.7% = US$2.3b ÷ US$34b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2025).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.07 in profit.\n\nView our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nAnalog Devices' Earnings Growth And 6.7% ROE When you first look at it, Analog Devices' ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 11%. However, the moderate 6.3% net income growth seen by Analog Devices over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing Analog Devices' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 5.3% over the last few years.\n\nStory Continues\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Analog Devices is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry.\n\nIs Analog Devices Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? The high three-year median payout ratio of 85% (or a retention ratio of 15%) for Analog Devices suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.\nBesides, Analog Devices has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 39% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 16% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.\n\nConclusion In total, it does look like Analog Devices has some positive aspects to its business. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?
