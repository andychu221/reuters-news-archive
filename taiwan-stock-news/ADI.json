      "Content": "Has Analog Devices’ 110% Five Year Surge Left Much Upside at $278?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nWondering if Analog Devices is still worth buying after its huge run, or if most of the upside is already priced in, you are not the only one asking that question right now.\nThe stock has climbed to around $278.40, adding 0.8% in the last week, 18.5% over the last month, and delivering 31.7% year to date and 32.4% over the past year, with a massive 110.6% gain over five years that highlights its long term momentum.\nMuch of this strength ties back to the market rewarding high quality analog and mixed signal chip makers as AI, automotive, and industrial demand reshape the semiconductor landscape. This has pushed investors to pay up for durable cash flows. At the same time, broader enthusiasm for infrastructure, automation, and energy efficiency has kept capital flowing into companies like Analog Devices that sit at the heart of these themes.\nDespite that backdrop, Analog Devices only scores 1 out of 6 on our undervaluation checks. Next we will break down what the main valuation models say about the stock, and then finish with a more holistic way to judge whether the current price truly makes sense.\n\nAnalog Devices scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Analog Devices Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to today, using a rate that reflects risk and the time value of money.\nFor Analog Devices, the latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is about $4.0 billion. Analysts expect FCF to keep rising, with projections, and then Simply Wall St extrapolations, pointing to around $6.3 billion by 2029 and just over $8.2 billion by 2035. These figures assume healthy but gradually moderating growth as the business matures.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back and summed, the DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of roughly $162.04 per share. Compared with the current share price near $278, the model implies the stock is about 71.8% overvalued. This suggests the market is paying a steep premium for growth and quality.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Analog Devices may be overvalued by 71.8%. Discover 912 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Analog Devices.\nApproach 2: Analog Devices Price vs Earnings For profitable, established businesses like Analog Devices, the Price to Earnings, or PE, ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are paying for each dollar of current profits. In general, faster expected earnings growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or higher uncertainty call for a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalog Devices currently trades on a PE of about 60.1x, which is well above both the broader Semiconductor industry average of around 36.8x and the peer group average of roughly 62.4x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio of 31.4x for Analog Devices, which is the PE you might expect based on its specific earnings growth profile, margins, industry positioning, market cap and risk factors.\n\nThis Fair Ratio is more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the sector, because it adjusts for how Analog Devices differs from other chip makers in quality and growth, rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. With the current PE of 60.1x sitting far above the 31.4x Fair Ratio, the stock screens as materially overvalued on this metric.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1463 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Analog Devices Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about a company, translated into numbers like future revenue, earnings, margins and a fair value estimate. A Narrative connects what you believe about Analog Devices, such as AI and autos driving a durable recovery, to a concrete financial forecast and then to a specific fair value you can compare against today’s share price. On Simply Wall St, Narratives are an easy tool available on the Community page, where millions of investors share these story driven models and see in real time whether their Fair Value suggests a buy, hold or sell at the current market price. Because Narratives update dynamically as new news, earnings or guidance comes in, your view of ADI can evolve automatically as the facts change. For example, one investor might build a bullish ADI Narrative that supports a fair value near $310, while a more cautious investor could justify something closer to $155. Both perspectives are made explicit, comparable and testable against the live price.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Analog Devices?

      "Content": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Analog Devices (ADI): Should You Buy?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 15, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nThe recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Analog Devices (ADI).\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADI Check price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Analog Devices, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ADI Worth Investing In? In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.7% over the past month to $9.74.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices.

      "Content": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Analog Devices Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 15, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nHow much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Analog Devices (ADI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ADI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nAnalog Devices' Business In-Depth With that in mind, let's take a look at Analog Devices' main business drivers.\nAnalog Devices, Inc. is headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts. The company is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.\n\nThe product line is composed of amplifiers and comparators; analog to digital converters; digital to analog converters; video encoders and decoders; embedded processing products and DSPs; MEMS and temperature sensors; RF/IF components and converters; power and thermal management ICs, audio/video converters, amplifiers, CODECs, filters and processors.\n\nThe company also offers analog, digital and RF switches and multiplexers; analog microcontrollers; clock and timing products; voltage references; interface products such as isolators, translators and transceivers; wireless products and converters; broadband products including amplifiers, CODECs, chipsets, splitters.\n\nAnalog Devices has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Ireland, and Southeast Asia. The company also uses outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.\n\nNotably, the company generated $11.02 billion in revenues in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company generates revenues from four organized end-markets &ndash; Industrial, Consumer, Communications and Automotive.\n\nIn the Industrial market (46% of fiscal 2025 revenues), Analog Devices caters to the needs of industrial and instrumentation, defense/aerospace, energy management and healthcare sectors.\n\nIn the Communications market (13%), Analog Devices offers products required in internet infrastructures, broadband and wireless applications.\n\nFor the Automotive market (28%), the company offers products that are utilized in infotainment, electrification, autonomous, ADAS and safety applications.\n\nFurther, the company takes care of the requirements in feature-rich, high-performance products such as portable devices and prosumer video/audio equipment in the Consumer market (13%).\n\nThe company caters to the growing demand for its products in these aforementioned markets via its strong sales channels. We note that it has direct sales offices, sales representatives and distributors in more than 50 countries.\n\nStory Continues\nBottom Line Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Analog Devices, ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in December 2015 would be worth $4,906.38, or a gain of 390.64%, as of December 15, 2025, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 239.27% and gold's return of 289.52% over the same time frame.\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for ADI too.\nAnalog Devices' latest quarterly results demonstrate broad-based recovery, margin resilience and strong free cash flow generation. Secular growth drivers in automation, AI infrastructure and automotive electrification provide multi-year tailwinds. Strong momentum across the electric vehicle space on the back of its robust Battery Management System solutions remains a tailwind. Strong investments in technology and business innovation are contributing well. Key partnerships and internal fab investments position Analog Devices for sustainable growth. Its strong cash flow generation capability and aggressive shareholder return policies are other positives. However, rising exposure to geopolitical uncertainties and tariffs could curtail production and disrupt customer demand, while increasing operating expenses may weigh on profitability.\n\nShares have gained 18.92% over the past four weeks and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2026 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "Content": "Is It Time To Consider Buying Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)?\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 15, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nAnalog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Analog Devices’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nIs Analog Devices Still Cheap? Analog Devices is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that Analog Devices’s ratio of 60.32x is above its peer average of 37.03x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Semiconductor industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Analog Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nWhat does the future of Analog Devices look like? Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Analog Devices. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ADI’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ADI should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nStory Continues\nAre you a potential investor?

      "Content": "Return Trends At Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Aren't Appealing\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, December 11, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nThere are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Analog Devices ( NASDAQ:ADI ), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Analog Devices:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.067 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$48b - US$3.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2025) .\nThus, Analog Devices has an ROCE of 6.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Semiconductor industry average of 8.9%.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Analog Devices compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Analog Devices .\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us The returns on capital haven't changed much for Analog Devices in recent years. The company has employed 123% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 6.7%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Analog Devices' ROCE Long story short, while Analog Devices has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 115% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.\n\nOn a final note, we've found 1 warning sign for Analog Devices that we think you should be aware of.\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Q3 Earnings Roundup: Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) And The Rest Of The Analog Semiconductors Segment\n\nKayode Omotosho\nWed, December 10, 2025 at 7:37 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here’s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q3. Today, we are looking at analog semiconductors stocks, starting with Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI).\nDemand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years.\n\nThe 15 analog semiconductors stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.8% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 7,676% above.\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 1.1% on average since the latest earnings results.\nAnalog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Founded by two MIT graduates, Ray Stata and Matthew Lorber in 1965, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is one of the largest providers of high performance analog integrated circuits used mainly in industrial end markets, along with communications, autos, and consumer devices.\nAnalog Devices reported revenues of $3.08 billion, up 25.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.1%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with revenue guidance for next quarter beating analysts’ expectations and a decent beat of analysts’ revenue estimates.\n\"ADI's strong fourth quarter capped a robust year of both cyclical and idiosyncratic growth,\" said Vincent Roche, CEO and Chair.\nInterestingly, the stock is up 17.4% since reporting and currently trades at $281.08.\nIs now the time to buy Analog Devices? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free for active Edge members .\nBest Q3: Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) Result of a merger of Alpha Industries and the wireless communications division of Conexant, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) is a designer and manufacturer of chips used in smartphones, autos, and industrial applications to amplify, filter, and process wireless signals.\nSkyworks Solutions reported revenues of $1.1 billion, up 7.3% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 5.4%. The business had a stunning quarter with a beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and revenue guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts’ expectations.\nAlthough it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 4.6% since reporting. It currently trades at $68.67.\n\nStory Continues\nIs now the time to buy Skyworks Solutions? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free for active Edge members .\nWeakest Q3: Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) Serving major consumer electronics manufacturers, Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) is a provider of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies used in display and lighting applications.\nUniversal Display reported revenues of $139.6 million, down 13.6% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 15.9%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts’ revenue estimates and a significant miss of analysts’ adjusted operating income estimates.\n\nUniversal Display delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 9.8% since the results and currently trades at $122.21.\nRead our full analysis of Universal Display’s results here.\nNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) Spun off from Dutch electronics giant Philips in 2006, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) is a designer and manufacturer of chips used in autos, industrial manufacturing, mobile devices, and communications infrastructure.\nNXP Semiconductors reported revenues of $3.17 billion, down 2.4% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations. Taking a step back, it was a mixed quarter as it also logged revenue guidance for next quarter topping analysts’ expectations but EPS in line with analysts’ estimates.\n\nThe stock is up 4.1% since reporting and currently trades at $230.61.\nRead our full, actionable report on NXP Semiconductors here, it’s free for active Edge members.\nMACOM (NASDAQ:MTSI) Founded in the 1950s as Microwave Associates, a communications supplier to the US Army Signal Corp, today MACOM Technology Solutions (NASDAQ: MTSI) is a provider of analog chips used in optical, wireless, and satellite networks.\nMACOM reported revenues of $261.2 million, up 30.1% year on year. This number met analysts’ expectations. More broadly, it was a mixed quarter as it also recorded revenue guidance for next quarter topping analysts’ expectations but an increase in its inventory levels.\n\nMACOM achieved the fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is up 24.3% since reporting and currently trades at $186.06.\nRead our full, actionable report on MACOM here, it’s free for active Edge members.\nMarket Update Thanks to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been on a steady path downward, easing back toward that 2% sweet spot. Fortunately (miraculously to some), all this tightening didn’t send the economy tumbling into a recession, so here we are, cautiously celebrating a soft landing. The cherry on top? Recent rate cuts (half a point in September 2024, a quarter in November) have propped up markets, especially after Trump’s November win lit a fire under major indices and sent them to all-time highs. However, there’s still plenty to ponder — tariffs, corporate tax cuts, and what 2025 might hold for the economy.\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?
