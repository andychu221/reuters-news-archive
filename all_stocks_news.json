      "Content": "4 Stocks to Buy in January That Could Join Nvidia in the $1 Trillion Club by 2030\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 5:29 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nORCL\n\nV\n\nXOM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Visa and ExxonMobil are highly efficient businesses that return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nOracle is a high-risk, high-potential-reward bet on increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nNetflix deserves a premium valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Visa ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ended 2025 as the most valuable company in the world. It is one of nine S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stocks with market capitalizations exceeding $1 trillion -- the others being Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Broadcom , Tesla , and Berkshire Hathaway .\nEli Lilly , Walmart , and JPMorgan Chase only need to rise 14% or less to expand the list to 12 companies.\nHere's why Visa (NYSE: V) , ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) , and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) have what it takes to be winning investments over the next five years and join the $1 trillion club by 2030.\n1. Visa Visa's path to $1 trillion is fairly straightforward. The payment processor has high margins, a reasonable valuation , and steady earnings growth, and returns tons of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nVisa can generate high single-digit or double-digit earnings growth even during challenging periods.\nDespite slowdowns in consumer spending, Visa grew non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) earnings per share by 14% in 2025. If Visa can maintain that growth rate going forward, it could reach a market cap well beyond $1 trillion by 2030.\n\n2. ExxonMobil ExxonMobil will need to double in five years to surpass $1 trillion in market cap. It absolutely has what it takes.\nExxonMobil is generating gobs of free cash flow (FCF) and high earnings, even though oil prices are hovering around four-year lows. It has reduced its production costs and can break even at low oil prices, and has plenty of upside potential during a higher-price environment. It also has a growing low-carbon business and a massive refining and marketing segment.\n\nExxonMobil's corporate plan through 2030 forecasts double-digit earnings growth even if oil and gas prices are mediocre. Although the U.S. Energy Information Administration is only forecasting $55 per Brent crude oil barrel in 2026, oil prices could rise in the coming years due to economic demand fueled by artificial intelligence (AI), as well as overall economic growth and geopolitical tensions.\nEither way, ExxonMobil doesn't need a lot of help from oil prices to grow earnings at a solid pace. A 15% annual growth rate, compounded over five years, would double earnings. Given the stock's reasonable volatility, it could double as well, pole-vaulting ExxonMobil over the $1 trillion bar.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the meantime, ExxonMobil investors will benefit from its stable and growing 3.4% dividend, which ExxonMobil has increased for 43 consecutive years.\n3. Oracle Oracle almost surpassed $1 trillion in market cap in September before falling over 40% from that high due to concerns about its AI spending and mounting debt.\nOracle is ramping up spending to build out data center infrastructure to grow its cloud computing market share, especially for high-performance computing workflows. It exited its most recent quarter with $523 billion in remaining performance obligations, signaling demand is high for its infrastructure. But Oracle needs to convert capital expenditures into earnings. In the meantime, it is FCF negative, making Oracle a leveraged bet on increased AI adoption.\n\nDespite its risks, Oracle's potential is impossible to ignore. Oracle is a great buy for investors who agree that its aggressive AI investments are the right long-term move and are willing to endure what will likely be a highly volatile period in the stock price.\n4. Netflix Over the last six months, Netflix's market cap has slipped from over $560 billion to under $400 billion due to a mix of valuation concerns and uncertainties regarding its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) . Netflix will probably receive regulatory approval for the acquisition, but still faces challenges from Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ: PSKY) , which is attempting a hostile takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nBut with or without Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix has what it takes to steadily grow earnings through a combination of global subscriber growth and pricing power. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, it could create a highly lucrative top-tier streaming platform that features content from both Netflix and HBO, as well as a revamped ad-supported tier.\nEven without HBO, Netflix has mastered the art of aligning content spending with steady subscription revenues, thanks to its depth and breadth of content -- from building global franchises from scratch like Stranger Things , to the success of KPop Demon Hunters.\nNetflix has already demonstrated impeccable pricing power with multiple price increases in a relatively short amount of time and a crackdown on password sharing that was largely accepted by users -- even during a period when people are pulling back on discretionary spending. So even if it doesn't quite crack the $1 trillion club, I still fully expect Netflix to be a winning investment and outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years.\n\nStart the new year off right with these top stocks With the broader indexes around all-time highs, it's easy to get enamored by the companies that could surge in value in the coming months or in 2026. But a far more rewarding approach is to invest in companies that have what it takes to compound in value over the long term.\nVisa, ExxonMobil, Oracle, and Netflix certainly fit that mold. That's why I expect all four stocks to outperform the S&P 500 and join the $1 trillion club over the next five years, even though they are currently far from reaching that milestone.\n\nShould you buy stock in Visa right now? Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

I wrote a story yesterday on Yahoo Finance saying laying out why the stock could rise 50% next year. I got a lot of uh, let's say negative feedback on that. Very important, I wasn't making this call. I was just laying out the reasons why it could happen. Am I out of my mind here?\n00:22 Speaker B\nWelcome to the investment business.\n00:25 Speaker B\nUm no, I saw it and I do agree. I think there are a number it it's been a laggard. Uh they delivered robust earnings. I mean, really a massive earnings beat last quarter. Um the AWS business is very mature but still growing at 20%. and they and they offered this tidbit that I didn't see many people talk about and that is that October growth in that business was bigger than the whole third quarter. So, I I wouldn't underestimate them. Traium is at full capacity and uh has a backlog and it's a stock that's trading at a peg of 1.4 times. If you go back and look at the S&P historically, it's traded at a peg of 1.5 to two times. Um so I think this company is fairly valued um and has the ability to deliver not just robust earnings growth, but free cash flow is going to increase next year to levels we haven't seen in five years.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "在討論晶片赴美生產時，「可持續性」始終是外界最關切的問題之一。對台積電 (2330-TW) 而言，在美國設廠生產晶片，代表必須承受毛利率明顯下滑的代價，這也成為其海外擴張面臨的核心挑戰。\n\n根據《Wccftech》報導，川普政府高度重視「美國製造」的政策敘事，半導體更被視為戰略核心產業。\n\n在此背景下，台積電與三星等晶片大廠紛紛加大對美投資，試圖在美國建立具韌性的半導體供應鏈。\n\n台積電計畫將對美國供應鏈的整體承諾擴大至最高 3,000 億美元，涵蓋亞利桑那州晶圓廠群、先進封裝，以及研發設施。\n\n然而，根據分析師 Jukan 在社群平台 X 上分享、並由 SemiAnalysis 彙整的數據顯示，台積電若在美國生產晶片，勢必對獲利能力造成明顯衝擊。\n\n數據顯示，台積電在美國營運晶圓廠的成本遠高於台灣，其中最主要的支出來源為「折舊」與「人力成本」。\n\n折舊指的是晶圓廠建設與設備在使用年限內攤提的成本。若美國廠採用與台灣相同製程技術，卻因產能與產量不足，僅能生產約四分之一的晶圓數量，等同於每片晶圓必須分攤更高的「折舊成本」。\n\n這也是為何美國晶圓的折舊成本約為台灣的四倍。再加上建廠費用與日常營運支出，美國晶圓廠必須承擔更高的固定成本，進一步壓縮毛利空間。\n\n除了折舊，人力成本也是美國設廠的一大痛點。台積電若要為美國晶圓廠補足人力，選項無非是聘用當地員工，或從台灣調派工程師，但在成本結構上，後者明顯更具效率。\n\n台積電創辦人張忠謀曾形容台美工程師文化差異指出，若設備在凌晨出問題，美國通常要等到隔天早上才會處理，但在台灣，「工程師半夜接到電話，會立刻起床穿衣、趕赴現場。」\n\n為了維持對美投資的承諾，台積電仍必須優先顧及整體毛利率，並滿足美國在地無晶圓廠客戶的需求。\n\n然而，高漲的營運成本已對獲利造成實質衝擊，亞利桑那晶圓廠近期更出現單季獲利下滑幅度創新高的情況，也凸顯在台灣以外地區製造晶片的可持續性挑戰。\n\n更多鉅亨報導&bull;台積電2奈米被瘋搶！訂單滿到2026年、蘋果A20成史上「最燒錢」手機晶片",

      "Content": "Is This a Rare Buying Opportunity for Amazon Stock?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 10:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon has multiple high-growth business segments, despite low stock returns in 2025.\nThis mismatch presents a buying opportunity, especially as Amazon continues to harness artificial intelligence.\nAmazon's online ads are boosting margins while catching up to Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a reliable long-term performer, but the growth stock didn't have a spectacular 2025. The growth stock only gained 5% despite strong financial results throughout the year, and this mismatch makes Amazon look promising.\nIt has made great strides in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), four industries that are poised for long-term growth. That's enough to warrant a closer look, and when you dig into recent results, Amazon's stock seems undervalued at current levels.\nOnline ads can boost margins Amazon's margins have received a massive boost in recent years as its business diversifies beyond online retail. While Amazon Web Services has taken center stage in the company's long-term plans, investors should also consider the growth in Amazon's online advertising segment.\nThat part of the business was up by 24% year over year in Q3, reaching $17.7 billion. Although ad revenue is a little less than 10% of Amazon's total revenue, it is a high-margin business. Amazon is also competing with tech giants Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) with online ads. Meta Platforms earned $51.2 billion in Q3, while Alphabet brought in $65.9 billion from ads.\n\nAmazon's ad business is catching up to the two adtech leaders. It's still growing at a great pace despite the one-year stock gains not reflecting that.\nArtificial intelligence enables multiple tailwinds While some AI stocks are speculative, Amazon is already making money with this technology. Amazon Web Services revenue growth has accelerated and achieved a 20% year-over-year growth rate, returning to 2022 growth levels, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\nArtificial intelligence requires more cloud computing, and that has resulted in more companies turning to Amazon Web Services. Amazon's cloud platform also lets businesses build AI agents.\n\nAmazon is also using internal Trainium2 chips to power parts of its cloud platform. Trainium2 AI chips can reduce Amazon's chip costs, making it easier for the company to expand its AI presence. These same AI chips are generating strong demand and can become another valuable segment under Amazon's corporate umbrella. For instance, Trainium2 AI chips grew by 150% sequentially and are now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is also using AI to enhance its offerings, such as its online marketplace. AI lets Amazon present personalized product recommendations and display ads that are more likely to get clicks.\nThe tech giant's stock price movements over the past year do not reflect the quality of the business. Amazon's overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year in Q3, while net income rose by 38% year-over-year.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】2026年初，全球科技股將迎來兩個高度關鍵事件：美國拉斯維加斯的CES消費電子展，以及台積電1月法人說明會。前者代表終端需求與應用場景的最新風向，後者則是半導體供給端與資本支出循環的核心指標。在AI投資主軸仍然清晰的背景下，這兩項事件有望協助市場從短期題材修正回到基本面，並引導資金重新聚焦在具備結構性成長與出貨能見度的受惠族群。\n\n從CES展的角度來看，2026年的最大特色在於市場不再單純為「AI 能做什麼」買單，而是開始檢驗「AI是否真的能被穩定使用」。無論是智慧家居、穿戴裝置或機器人，展會訊息顯示，廠商正試圖以續航時間、即時反應與隱私保護等實際體驗，說服消費者與企業端加快採用。對投資人而言，CES的價值不在於單一明星產品，而在於平台化與生態系是否成形，以及量產與上市時程是否同步揭露。\n\n值得注意的是，本屆CES的另一條隱性主線，落在「端側AI的基礎建設」。隨著AI功能逐步下放至終端設備，對高效率電源管理、感測器融合、記憶體頻寬與高速介面的需求同步上升。這類需求雖不如終端產品吸睛，卻直接影響整體使用體驗與成本結構。若展後能看到OEM與平台商在規格與供應鏈選擇上趨於一致，將有助於相關零組件供應商取得較長期的訂單能見度，也更容易被資本市場視為「可投資的成長題材」。\n\n機器人與Physical AI仍是CES最具想像空間的板塊，但同時也是市場最謹慎看待的領域。投資焦點已從舞台展示轉向實際任務的穩健度與商業可行性，尤其是在非受控環境下的安全性與長期維護成本。若主流平台能在展期或展後釋出清楚的SDK、生態夥伴與應用案例，相關的致動器、視覺感測、邊緣運算與工業電腦供應鏈，才有機會從題材性評價，轉為基本面驅動。\n\n然而，CES所釋出的需求訊號，最終仍需上游供應鏈的產能與技術配合，這也使得台積電1月法說成為市場更關鍵的定錨點。2026年初法說會的重心，將不只是單季營運表現，而是資本支出規模、先進製程擴產節奏，以及先進封裝是否持續放量。\n\n隨著AI應用由雲端延伸至邊緣，晶片設計對能效與異質整合的依賴程度提高，台積電在2nm製程與CoWoS、SoIC等封裝技術上的布局，直接影響整條供應鏈的投資信心。\n\n市場普遍預期，2026年台積電資本支出將由2025年的400～420億美元提高至500億美元，重點放在3nm擴產、2nm量產爬坡以及先進封裝產能擴張。\n\n由於CoWoS仍是AI晶片的關鍵瓶頸，任何關於產能提升、良率改善與交期穩定的說法，都可能成為資金重新布局封裝測試與材料族群的重要催化劑。即便海外新廠與新節點初期可能壓抑短期毛利，但只要定價能力與長期毛利率目標維持不變，市場對先進製程的估值邏輯仍將站得住腳。整體而言，CES與台積電法說形成了需求端與供給端的雙重驗證。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一凱基投顧董事長朱晏民)",

Srinivas noted that no AI model has yet been released that can run efficiently on a local chip while completing tasks reliably.\nThe Indian-born entrepreneur expects early adoption on MacBooks or iPads before reaching smartphones.\nImplications For Robotics And Labor He also discussed the potential for AI in the physical world, especially in robotics.

      "Content": "【時報記者張佳琪台北報導】台股2026年第一個交易日成績亮眼，指數盤中刷新歷史新高紀錄至29363點，終場收在29349點，大漲386點，漲幅1.33%。累計單週強漲793點，週線連2紅，漲幅達2.78%，平均日均量5388.51億元。隨著CES展即將登場，且台積電法說會在即，投信對於元月行情抱持樂觀。\n\n台股2025年封關日的強勢行情延續至2026年紅盤日，大盤新年度開門喜，法人也同步買超。統計顯示，外資與自營商連袂買超台股，外資單週回補254.81億元，連續兩週站在買方；自營商買超169.02億元，已連續六週回補台股。僅投信法人連續兩週調節124.8億元。合計三大法人單週共買超台股299.04億元。\n\n保德信市值動能50 ETF(009803)經理人楊立楷展望台股2026年，認為有望續創新高。他說明，主要受惠AI需求有增無減，盤點於全球對台灣出口產品的需求持續強勁，尤其是涵蓋AI、半導體與電子零組件相關領域的電子產品、資訊通信年增率相對突出，也推升台灣企業產能，預估2026年台股企業獲利將延續雙位數高速成長。\n\n楊立楷表示，國際AI巨頭紛紛擴張資本支出並簽署合作協議，預期相關乘數效應將推動應用層面百花齊放，對於台廠AI供應鏈不啻為重大利多。而根據歷史數據，台股走勢與企業獲利呈現高度正向關聯，獲利增長往往伴隨指數上行，未來行情更值得期待。\n\n針對未來一週台股脈動，楊立楷表示，首先關注將於6日至9日在拉斯維加斯舉行的CES展，根據主辦單位預估，本次吸引約13萬名與會者、4500家廠商參展，且隨著AI持續發展，本屆CES以「AI Forward」為主題，反映出AI已不只停留在概念驗證階段，而是正式走向新的應用面與商業化階段。他說，本次CES展主題可預期人工智慧、智慧家居、綠色科技及車用技術將為焦點，並釋出AI落地與新應用的最新趨勢，而這些需求面將直接影響封裝、PCB、光通訊與記憶體等產業的拉貨節奏，進而激勵台廠供應鏈股價的表現空間。\n\n再者，光學龍頭大廠大立光於8日舉行法說會，晶圓龍頭大廠台積電法說會也將於15日舉辦。楊立楷提醒，兩大廠釋出的展望預料將牽動市場投資情緒。\n\n整體而言，楊立楷認為，從目前至1月上半月，美台股市通常呈現易漲難跌走勢，且時序進入1月，外資可望於假期結束全面回流，配合美股維持強勢及企業展望正向，台股有望再度放量推升，元月行情值得期待。",

      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Loaded Up on Nike Stock. Should You?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 12:38 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tim Cook bought 50,000 shares of Nike stock.\nThe Apple CEO is a director on Nike's board.\nNike recently returned to top-line growth, but there are still some major concerns.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nWhen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE) in late December, it got a lot of attention and even sent shares of the athletic apparel and shoe company sharply higher. After all, not only is Cook a successful businessman, but he is a Nike insider. The CEO sits on Nike's board of directors.\nInvestors sometimes treat insider buying as a simple signal: management (or board members) think the stock is undervalued. Sometimes that's right. But investors shouldn't follow blindly.\nSo, is Nike stock a good buy today or not? Let's take a look.\nCook's buy matters, but so does the context Notably, Cook's purchase was an open market one. This means it wasn't part of a stock option compensation plan (or a similar plan). Rather, he had to pay full price for his shares. Additionally, the purchase was sizable, totaling nearly $3 million. It also nearly doubled his stake in the company. Given the size of the purchase and the significant increase in Cook's stake, it's not surprising that the market interpreted the purchase as good news.\n\nStill, it's important to remember that Cook is a Nike director.\nThat doesn't mean the purchase is meaningless. But it does mean he may have incentives beyond pure return maximization. Directors often want to demonstrate alignment with shareholders, reinforce confidence during a rough stretch, or meet (or stay ahead of) internal ownership expectations. In other words, it can be both a sincere vote of confidence and a governance-minded move.\nA rough patch Investors should look beyond Cook's purchase to answer this simple question: Does Nike's business momentum (or lack of it) and valuation offer an attractive risk-reward right now?\nUnfortunately, I don't think so.\nNike's turnaround is making progress, but the business still looks challenged.\n\nRevenue in the company's second quarter of fiscal 2026 (a period ended on Nov. 30, 2025), rose just 1% year over year. Further, the composition of this revenue was probably even more discouraging than this anemic headline figure. Yes, wholesale revenue rose 8% year over year, but its higher-margin Nike Direct revenue fell 8%. Nike Direct is the company's direct-to-consumer channel, made up of Nike-owned stores and sales through its digital platforms. So, this channel speaks to the company's brand power with consumers, given how directly these channels are tied to its business and to consumers.\n\nStory Continues\nNike's profitability also moved in the wrong direction. Gross margin fell 300 basis points to 40.6%, and net income declined 32% to $792 million.\nSome of Nike's near-term problems are self-inflicted as it tries to reposition parts of its business and sharpen its product and brand message so that it can perform better over the long term. But Nike still has a lot of work to do.\n\n\"NIKE is in the middle innings of our comeback,\" said Nike CEO Elliott Hill in the company's latest earnings release, adding that the company is working through its \"Win Now\" strategic actions, including \"strengthening partner relationships\" and \"rebalancing our portfolio...\"\nMeanwhile, the athleisure space remains intensely competitive , as the company faces major competition from younger brands like Lululemon , Vuori, and Hoka, as well as more established brands like Adidas . Of course, Nike's brand still has enormous global equity. But consumers have more choices than ever.\nA look at valuation I'd be more willing to recommend Nike in the middle of its turnaround and an intensely competitive environment, but shares arguably don't look cheap enough. Sure, the company's dividend yield of 2.6% is solid, and Nike has an exceptional balance sheet. But with earnings moving in the wrong direction and sales barely growing, it's tough to justify the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 37.\n\nEven Nike's forward price-to-earnings is high, at 40. Measuring its price as a multiple of analysts' expected earnings per share over the next year, the fact that Nike's forward price-to-earnings ratio is higher than its trailing price-to-earnings ratio shows that analysts expect earnings to remain under pressure.\nGiven the competitive intensity in athleisure, declining sales in its direct-to-consumer channel, margin pressure, and ongoing uncertainty as far as tariffs go, I personally will be staying on the sidelines.\nCook's buy in Nike stock is interesting. But, for me, that's about all it is.\nShould you buy stock in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Should You Think About Buying Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Now?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 5:46 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. ( NASDAQ:SWKS ), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$80.66 and falling to the lows of US$60.50. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Skyworks Solutions' current trading price of US$64.40 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Skyworks Solutions’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhat Is Skyworks Solutions Worth? The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Skyworks Solutions today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $78.52, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Skyworks Solutions’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nWhat kind of growth will Skyworks Solutions generate? Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Skyworks Solutions' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? SWKS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nStory Continues\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SWKS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Skyworks Solutions , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\nIf you are no longer interested in Skyworks Solutions, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Marvell Technology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRVL) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nWith its stock down 9.0% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study Marvell Technology's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marvell Technology is:\n18% = US$2.5b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2025).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Marvell Technology\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nMarvell Technology's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE To start with, Marvell Technology's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Marvell Technology's net income shrunk at a rate of 6.6% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\nThat being said, we compared Marvell Technology's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 5.0% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MRVL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory Continues\nIs Marvell Technology Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? When we piece together Marvell Technology's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 8.4% (where it is retaining 92% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nIn addition, Marvell Technology has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 3.9% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.\nConclusion In total, it does look like Marvell Technology has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia has purchased Intel shares worth $5 billion, carrying out a transaction ‌announced in September.\nThe AI chipmaker had announced back then that it would pay $23.28 per share for Intel ⁠common stock, buying over 214.7 million Intel shares at the price set out in the agreement, as per Monday's filing. The deal forms part of a broader strategic agreement to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers.\nThe share purchase comes just a week after Reuters reported that Nvidia Corp. has halted a test to use Intel’s advanced 18A manufacturing process to make advanced chips. The AI chipmaker tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, the report said.\nInvestors had been closely watching Intel's advanced 18A as a milestone that could help the company compete more directly with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in advanced chip manufacturing. However, the halt now raises concerns about the company’s ability to regain ground in the foundry race.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures, and sells computer products and technologies, delivering data storage, computer, networking, and communications platforms.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) share price has soared 109% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock!\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring three years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 28% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Apple will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 112% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective Apple shareholders are up 12% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 16% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Apple you should know about.\n\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

Analyst sentiment has followed that move. Jefferies upgraded the shares to Buy and lifted its price target to $1,500. Oppenheimer kept an Outperform rating and set a $1,400 target. Those calls helped reinforce momentum and pushed investor confidence higher.\n\nThe broader backdrop has also helped. SEMI expects semiconductor equipment sales to hit a record in 2025, driven largely by AI-related investment. Those macro tailwinds fueled a rally across the sector, lifting many equipment names at the same time.\nEarlier in October, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates. Management pointed to strong AI-linked demand for its chipmaking tools, while also calling out growing risks tied to its China exposure amid ongoing US–China trade tensions.\nDemand for advanced chips that support generative AI workloads has continued to climb. That trend benefits niche suppliers like KLA, whose equipment is used inside semiconductor manufacturing facilities, commonly known as fabs.\n\nTrade policy remains a clear headwind. KLA expects US export restrictions to reduce sales by $300M to $350M over the next five quarters. The company said this reflects “additional market access loss related to certain customers in China resulting from extended export controls from the U.S. government,” according to a letter to shareholders.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is based in Milpitas, California. The company designs wafer fab equipment and supplies process control and yield management systems used across the semiconductor industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Moreover, AMD will be looking to build a platform, not just offer alternatives.\nCES 2025 recap: what Nvidia and AMD showed last year That said, here’s the lowdown from last year’s event for both tech giants.\nNvidia showed off its powerful Cosmos platform for “physical AI,” positioning it as a foundation for real-world deployment.\nNvidia introduced Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs while highlighting new RTX-PC AI tooling (including NIM microservices/Blueprints).\nAMD rolled out its AI PC portfolio, covering Ryzen AI Max/Max PRO , and expanded Ryzen AI 300 chips tailored to Copilot+ PCs.\nAMD leaned into gaming/graphics with Ryzen X3D desktop chips and Ryzen Z2 handheld processors. Also, it offered previews of the Radeon RX 9070- series (RDNA 4) GPUs and FSR 4.\n\nStory Continues\nAt CES 2026, the real fight is over AI CES 2026 runs January 6 to 9 in Las Vegas , and though it has historically been more of a gadget showcase, this year it’s shaping up to be the year’s first high-stakes tech meeting.\nInvestors expect a needle-moving event, spearheaded by concrete roadmaps, partnerships, and major commitments.\nFor the biggest chipmakers, CES will be all about owning the AI conversation early . Nvidia will seek to reinforce its dominance by rallying partners with demos, keynotes, and industry-wide signaling.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood shells out $1.3 million on biotech stock\nAMD will look to rain on Nvidia’s parade.\nBy spotlighting new PC platforms and capitalizing on a larger OEM market share , AMD will aim to carve out its own lane for AI-driven growth.\nFor perspective, the AI trade has lost its luster lately, and big-name skepticism targets are growing louder.\nFront and center is the “Big Short” Michael Burry , who is openly comparing the current AI frenzy to past manias.\nBurry delivered a scathing takedown of Nvidia.\nThat’s exactly why Nvidia and AMD will be looking for a strong start to set the tone early in 2026.\nBig banks reset targets on Nvidia and AMD Nvidia and AMD both had a solid outing at the stock market last year.\nFor perspective, Nvidia stock ended 2025 up 41% , while AMD posted an 83% gain .\nNow, Wall Street is recalibrating its expectations for 2026, with investors in “show-me” mode when it comes to AI.\nBank of America : Nvidia buy, $275 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nMorgan Stanley : Nvidia overweight, $250 price target; AMD equal weight, $260 price target\nUBS : Nvidia buy, $235 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nGoldman Sachs : Nvidia buy , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $210 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nJPMorgan : Nvidia overweight , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $270 price target\nSource: Barron's\nRelated: Veteran analyst resets AI stock buy list for 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 2, 2026, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

Dan, tell us.\n00:15 Dan Howley\nYeah, Jared, there's going to be a number of big announcements at this year's show. The the first obviously, will probably, and biggest, be out of Nvidia. They're hosting their own press event on January 5th. CEO Jensen Wong will take the stage. He did it last year as well. They announced a number of new products, a new chip for a smaller bitesize desktop AI computer, as well as a number of different software innovations that they've really been pushing as of late.

I mean, you know, the chips themselves are are, you know, obviously enough to say that AI is going to dominate, but uh you can expect to see a lot of robots, uh a lot of smart home devices. You can even see some wearables that are AI powered. And those usually, you know, so far we haven't seen anything too interesting as far as AI powered wearables outside of maybe, you know, the intelligence built into smart glasses or smart watches.

Shares of networking chips designer Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 4.9% in the afternoon session after positive reports highlighted strong momentum in its AI-focused custom chip business and optimistic growth projections for the year ahead.\nThe company’s AI XPU offerings experienced significant traction, which led to a 37.8% year-over-year increase in its data center segment revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. This growth was driven by its custom silicon products. Looking forward, analysts projected a “snap-back” year for Marvell, with expectations for revenue to surge by approximately 40% in fiscal 2026. This anticipated growth was fueled by both the recovery of its carrier and enterprise segments and the high-volume production of custom AI silicon, as previous inventory issues were largely resolved.\n\nIs now the time to buy Marvell Technology? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Marvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% on the news that investment firm Citi issued a positive catalyst watch for the stock ahead of the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES), contributing to a broader rally in the chip sector. Citi noted that worries about competition from two major clients were likely unfounded and viewed the stock's recent price drop as a buying opportunity. The firm anticipated Marvell would showcase wider use of its networking solutions at the conference. Adding to the positive sentiment, analysts at Benchmark clarified that Marvell had retained its role in Amazon's Trainium chip designs, easing recent investor concerns. The stock's move also came amid general strength in the semiconductor market, as other chipmakers like Micron and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index also posted gains.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,931.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

      "Content": "Is Broadcom Stock a Buy After the Dip?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:43 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Some investors are feeling skittish about the high levels of capital spending on AI.\nOne important player, Broadcom, has a big opportunity in custom chip production.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nSemiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the big winners in the recent generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom that started with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. Shares have soared by roughly 350% in three years as investors bet on its ability to capitalize on the soaring demand for advanced computing hardware.\n\nThat said, some market participants feel that the AI boom might be getting ahead of itself as companies overspend on data centers without a meaningful guarantee of future returns. This uncertainty has sent Broadcom's stock down by around 15% from its all-time high of $412.\nLet's dig deeper into the pros and cons of the stock to see if this dip is a buying opportunity or a signal for investors to stay far away.\nWhy are investors getting nervous? The stock's recent slide came after Broadcom's fourth-quarter earnings report in mid-December. On the surface, the numbers were fantastic.\nRevenue jumped 28% year over year to a record of $18 billion, driven by soaring demand for AI semiconductor revenue, which rose 74% in the period. This operating segment reflects sales of Broadcom's advanced computer hardware to AI data centers, and management expects the momentum to continue into 2026 as demand for these products continues to surge.\n\nBroadcom's bottom line is also looking great, with net income doubling to $8.5 billion. With numbers like these, it's hard to believe shares are on a two-week downtrend. However, the correction makes more sense when you look at some of the uncomfortable dynamics of the AI industry itself.\nAccording to analysts at Goldman Sachs , hyperscalers are on track to spend an eye-popping $527 billion on AI-related capital expenditures (capex) , with some of this going to hardware produced by companies like Broadcom. The problem is that the scale of the spending doesn't really match up with the profits generated by AI-related software services.\nDeutsche Bank expects ChatGPT creator OpenAI to lose $140 billion by 2029. And despite being one of the top hardware spenders (with roughly $125 billion in capex for 2025), Amazon saw its cloud computing revenue rise by a relatively modest $5.6 billion compared to the prior-year period. The fear is that eventually shareholders will start to push back on all the AI spending. After all, this is money that could be going to buybacks or dividends.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom might be better positioned than Nvidia It is fair to assume that AI-related capex spending could soon drop to reasonable levels, which could reduce the growth potential of infrastructure providers like Broadcom. That said, the company is better positioned to weather a potential fallout than the industry leader, Nvidia. To understand why, we must first look at the reasons why AI development is so expensive and generally unprofitable right now.\n\nRunning and training large language models like ChatGPT requires thousands of expensive AI accelerators (such as Nvidia's Blackwell series), which consume significant amounts of energy. Broadcom's semiconductor business actually helps solve this problem by helping its clients develop appl ication-specific integrated circui ts (ASICs). These are custom chips designed to do a specific workload, making them cheaper and easier to run than Nvidia's large, general-purpose chips.\nObviously, ASICs won't be the magic bullet that makes AI companies stop burning through money. But they are the natural first step as companies seek to reduce their reliance on expensive third-party hardware. In October, cloud giant Google selected Broadcom to build its first in-house AI processor chips. This development follows a deal with OpenAI to co-develop AI accelerators and Ethernet solutions.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy? Broadcom's ability to benefit from the transition to custom chips makes it a strong bet in the generative AI opportunity. That said, the AI boom is getting long in the tooth, and investors may want to wait until there is more clarity about the sustainability of current industry hardware spending before taking a position in such a highly exposed stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?

      "Content": "Dear AMD Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 5\n\nChris MacDonald\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:08 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nAmong the world's largest semiconductor makers, Nvidia (NVDA) remains the go-to choice for investors. And rightfully so—looking at this stock's long-term chart, investors who have stuck with this name have outperformed the market by an incredible margin in recent decades.\nOf course, it's not just a one-horse race, regardless of what the media tries to tell you. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is another top name worth considering, and one that's actually outperformed Nvidia on a year-to-date basis (YTD). Surging 77% to end 2025, AMD roughly doubled Nvidia's performance this year (the world's largest chipmaker still surged 39% higher in 2025, so not bad). Thus, there are plenty of eyeballs already on AMD as 2026 kicks off.\n\nMore News from Barchart NVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\nAfter Record Runs for Western Digital and Sandisk in 2025, Consider This 1 Data Center Storage Stock for 2026\nCrowdStrike Insiders Are Offloading CRWD Stock.

Sign Up Now!\nAs it turns out, there's another major catalyst on the horizon investors are watching when it comes to both companies. Analysts at Wedbush have pointed out that AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, is expected to make the keynote address at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on this date, with the potential for a big announcement to come.\n\nWhy Is This Catalyst So Important for AMD? I think the key announcements for AMD for this coming year are indeed likely to come at this event. CES is the biggest show in the world when it comes to anything tied to consumer electronics and is honestly one of the key shows I've always wanted to attend, for this reason. Many CEOs are expected to make big product announcements, from technological upgrades to next-generation technology expected to be released over the course of the year.\n\nI'd expect to see a strong narrative from Lisa Su around the company's roadmap moving forward, and Wedbush analysts tend to agree. They think that some “significant” technological improvements to AMD's core Ryzen chips could be announced at this conference. Doing so may propel a range of mega-cap tech companies who are looking for reasons to buy AMD chips (at a lower price point) to do so. Especially if the output differential between these Ryzen chips and Nvidia's new Blackwell and Rubin chips isn't as wide as it appears now.\n\nStory Continues\nWe'll have to see, of course, what is ultimately announced. But any sort of meaningful improvements in AMD's core CPU chip technology could spur greater investor interest in 2026 and take this stock's recent momentum to new levels. It does appear that AMD has retained strong pricing power, reflected in the company's margins above. If these margins expand further in the coming quarters, and AMD can show a cash flow growth profile that's above Wall Street estimates, I certainly think this is a stock that could be off to the races.\n\nSo, What Does Wall Street Think? As it turns out, Wedbush is just one of 44 analysts currently covering AMD stock. With a consensus price target of $285.05 per share on AMD stock, analysts believe that this chipmaker could have roughly 33% upside from current levels.\nThat's a healthy potential gain for investors looking to add some momentum to their portfolios in 2026. Indeed, momentum-driven growth stocks have provided most of the gains in the markets over the course of the past decade and a half. Thus, for those who think this trend is likely to continue and risk-on sentiment will remain in the coming year, AMD's fundamentals do point in a very positive direction right now.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 5.3% in the morning session after investor optimism grew following favorable analyst predictions for 2026 and anticipation of new product announcements.\nThe move came as top Wall Street analysts predicted a potential 32% jump in the stock's value for 2026, building on significant gains from the previous year. This positive outlook was tied to AMD's role in the artificial intelligence sector, driven by demand for high-performance computing and data centers. Adding to the excitement were rumors that the company planned to reveal a new, faster Ryzen chip and a new generation of processors at the upcoming CES 2026 conference. AMD's stock also benefited from a broader rally in tech stocks, as fresh excitement surrounding the prospects of AI lifted the sector.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $220.34, up 2.9% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us AMD’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 30 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago when the stock gained 6.8% on the news that investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains. Technology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Companies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflects a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity. The rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented companies.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,387.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened.

Customers shift to cloud subscriptions compared with on-premise deals for Splunk, and lower revenues from prior generation products negatively impacted top-line growth. Cisco’s Security offerings primarily include Network Security, Identity and Access Management, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Response offerings.\n\nHowever, Cisco’s new and refreshed products, which comprise roughly one-third of its security portfolio, are expected to help in reviving top-line growth. Solutions like SecureAccess, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense and refreshed firewalls are driving order growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Cisco saw mid-teens growth in demand for next-gen firewalls, and roughly 3,000 customers have purchased a new product since launch.\n\nSplunk continues to gain traction with annualized recurring revenues and product remaining performance obligations growing double digits in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Cisco believes the shift to cloud subscriptions reflects greater adoption and expansion of Splunk products. The addition of Splunk has strengthened CSCO’s TIDR offerings. The company has been integrating Cisco Extended Detection and Response (XDR) with Splunk Enterprise Security to create a unified and highly effective solution that helps in preventing, detecting, and responding to sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2026 service revenues is pegged at $2.16 billion, indicating 2.6% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nCSCO Faces Tough Competition in the Security Domain Cisco is facing stiff competition from Fortinet FTNT and Okta OKTA in the security domain.\n\nFortinet's AI-powered security operations business is accelerating rapidly. The company powers more than 20 AI-driven solutions through its FortiAI technology across three main areas: FortiAI-Protect for secure AI usage, FortiAI-Assist for AI-assisted operations, and FortiAI-SecureAI for secure LLM and AI systems. With more than 500 issued and pending AI patents, Fortinet is well-positioned to capitalize on growing AI security demand. The company launched its Secure AI Data Center solution, the industry's first end-to-end framework specifically designed for AI workloads, delivering high-capacity connectivity and up to 69% lower energy consumption than alternative solutions.\n\nOkta’s offerings include Okta AI, a suite of AI-powered capabilities embedded across several products, which empowers organizations to harness AI to build better experiences and protect against cyberattacks. The company benefits from strong demand for its new products, including Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Device Access, Fine Grained Authorization, Identity Security Posture Management and Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI. The company expects revenues to see a CAGR of 16% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026.

(NASDAQ:AVGO), its AI semiconductor division achieved $6.5 billion in Q4, improving 76% year-over-year and 25% sequentially.\nThe company reported $21 billion in orders from Anthropic over the last two quarters, while its six-quarter AI order backlog climbed to $73 billion. Broadcom’s list of clients now includes giants like Meta, ByteDance, and Google, as well as an additional contract with OpenAI to supply $1 billion in chips by late 2026.\n\nAccording to Reuters, while Broadcom’s backlog is scheduled to ship over the next 18 months, CFO Kirsten Spears warned that margins could fall. She stated that the Q1 consolidated gross margin is likely to fall roughly 100 basis points sequentially, owing to a higher percentage of AI revenue.\nAnalysts quoted by Reuters emphasize two main risks for the company, including its excessive concentration on just five AI customers, and weaker margins on AI systems, which are likely to account for a greater share of the total revenue in coming quarters, notably in the second half of fiscal year 2026.\nBroadcom Inc.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, Marvell Technology’s data center segment posted revenues of $1.52 billion, growing 37.8% year over year, led by strong traction in custom XPU silicon products.\n\nMarvell Technology expects its custom silicon business to roughly contribute to one-fourth of its overall data center revenues and grow at least 20% next year. The company recently unveiled 18 XPU and XPU-attach socket design wins, among which many are already in volume production.\nThese design wins include full custom XPU programs, XPU-attached silicon, electrical I/O chiplets integrated inside multi-die XPU packages and other products, contributing to a pipeline of more than 10% of a $75 billion lifetime revenue funnel. MRVL’s custom silicon strategy has evolved from a niche application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) offering into a deeply embedded, multi-year hyperscaler partnership model.\nNow, Marvell Technology develops custom ASIC designs for AI, cloud data center and OEM customers using its advanced 5nm and 3nm processes like 112G XSR serializer/de-serializer (SerDes), Long Reach SerDes, PCIe Gen 6 SerDes. These capabilities enable MRVL to stay ahead of its competitors in the custom AI silicon space.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against MRVL Broadcom AVGO is one of the leading suppliers of custom silicon solutions for data center, service provider and enterprise networking customers. Broadcom’s advanced 3.5D XDSiP packaging platform is specifically designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of custom AI XPUs.\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD is another player in the custom silicon solutions and AI accelerator space with its semi-custom SoC offerings and Instinct Accelerators that power numerous data centers. Advanced Micro Devices’ reconfigurable Alveo Adaptable Accelerator Cards are used to speed up compute-intensive applications in data centers.\n\nWhile Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices are formidable players in the custom silicon space for AI acceleration, Marvell Technology’s deep partnership with NVIDIA provides MRVL necessary support to sustain in this space.\nMRVL's Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Marvell Technology have gained 13.1% in the past six months compared with the Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s growth of 22.3%.\nMRVL 6-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Marvell Technology is trading at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 7.31X, lower than the industry’s average of 8.46X.\n\nStory Continues\nMRVL Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 81% and 26%, respectively.

      "Content": "Those who invested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) five years ago are up 89%\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nGenerally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 59% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 28%, including dividends.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.9% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 58.57.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Analog Devices will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective It's nice to see that Analog Devices shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors.

      "Content": "2 Reasons to Like QCOM (and 1 Not So Much)\n\nKayode Omotosho\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 8:04 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\nQualcomm trades at $171.30 per share and has stayed right on track with the overall market, gaining 5.5% over the last six months. At the same time, the S&P 500 has returned 9.9%.\nIs now the time to buy QCOM? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nWhy Does QCOM Stock Spark Debate? Having been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\nTwo Positive Attributes: 1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Luckily, Qualcomm’s sales grew at an impressive 15.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n2. Stellar ROIC Showcases Lucrative Growth Opportunities Growth gives us insight into a company’s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? A company’s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nQualcomm’s five-year average ROIC was 47%, placing it among the best semiconductor companies. This illustrates its management team’s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\nOne Reason to be Careful: Projected Revenue Growth Is Slim Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Qualcomm’s revenue to rise by 3%, a deceleration versus its 15.3% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nFinal Judgment Qualcomm’s merits more than compensate for its flaws, but at $171.30 per share (or 14.2× forward P/E), is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\n\nStory Continues\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions If your portfolio success hinges on just 4 stocks, your wealth is built on fragile ground.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】大摩日前發布報告，點名亞洲AI前十強，其中台灣包含台積電、聯發科、京元電、信驊、世芯、創意等6檔上榜，統一投顧總經理、PCB女王廖婉婷認為，6檔當中世芯股價低、成長性夠，是2026開門就可以找買點的個股；如果眼光放遠，創意、聯發科續航力強勁；而台積電則是「神主牌」，本土法人遲早會回補。\n\n大摩選的台股六強都是優質個股，如果硬要挑該如何選擇？廖婉婷在「鈔錢部署」中表示，自己會先考慮獲利成長性，如果基期夠低，2026就比較有機會。\n\n她以世芯-KY(3661)為例，2025業績呈現衰退，但因為它是AWS Trainium 3供應鏈，屬於後段ASIC供應商，因此2026的業績貢獻度會很大，光是AWS貢獻世芯營收成長就接近1倍，獲利更會有1倍以上的成長，目前本益比才20出頭，空間還蠻大。\n\n世芯前3季歸屬母公司業主淨利為41.14億元，年減10.7％，每股純益為50.89元，較去年同期58.43元衰退13%，主因是北美主要CSP客戶5奈米AI晶片在2025年畫句點，法人預估世芯2025年EPS為67.8元。\n\n廖婉婷表示，世芯大客戶AWS的Trainium 3大概會在第2季出，通常法人布局都會提前1季，因此當跨入元月1日、2026第1季剛開始的時候就可以加碼。\n\n除世芯外，2026年會打進馬斯克的xAI的創意(3443)，也是廖婉婷長期看好個股。馬斯克先前發下豪語，2027年的AI晶片需求會比全市場目前用的GPU加ASIC來得更多。\n\n大客戶因台積電產能，喜歡和台灣ASIC廠合作廖婉婷分析，如果以Robotaxi，加上他的AI機器人大軍有可能成真，果真如此，對創意2027年的業績貢獻將會很大。\n\n另外聯發科(2454)也是從消費性產品打進ASIC市場，不過它Google的TPU下一代要等到2026年下半年、甚至第4季才可能出貨，所以業績貢獻會比較慢，但市場認為，即使到2027年再下一代，聯發科還是會是供應商。\n\n對於國外的客戶偏好找台灣的IP廠商合作ASIC，廖婉婷說，原因是台廠和台積電合作緊密，大家都想拿到台積電的產能，再加上台灣的封測產業很強，因此讓國際大廠頻頻登門合作。\n\n廖婉婷評估大摩挑選的6檔中，世芯因為股價低、成長性夠強，會有很大的成長空間，被認為是首選；但如果需要續航力、把眼光放大2027年，創意和聯發科都有很大成長機會。\n\n至於台積電是「神主牌」，廖婉婷說，一定會帶領台股再創新高，台股現在本益比23、24倍，台積電本益比才20倍，對台積電而言股價太委屈。\n\n她分析，主要是先前外資放假、內資減碼，加上年底壽險銀行必須獲利了結，以及會計制度改變，以及外價金的提列得減碼，所以很多金控銀行壽險年底會減低持股，明年第1季外資、本土法人會回補台積電，台積電的本益比至少應回到22倍到24倍之上。\n\n※免責聲明：文中所提之個股、ETF內容，並非任何投資建議與參考，請審慎判斷評估風險，自負盈虧。(新聞來源：旺得富理財網 王郁惠)",

      "Content": "The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10%\n\nSam Quirke, MarketBeat\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 11:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nKey Points Qualcomm’s MACD just flipped bearish again, and the stock is already slipping after a strong run from April.\nA similar signal in early November was followed by a fast, double-digit drop, making this setup hard to ignore.\nThe near-term “tell” is whether buyers defend the low-$170s, or whether the stock breaks down ahead of February earnings.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAfter showing many promising signs over the past quarter, shares of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) are flashing a sudden warning signal as the new year begins. Just before Christmas, the stock’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) chart logged a bearish crossover, confirming a momentum shift that has continued into this week. The mega-cap tech stock closed just below $174 on Dec. 30, still up roughly 40% since April, but also down about 15% from the late-October surge that briefly reignited bullish enthusiasm.\nSince then, however, Qualcomm has been narrowing into a tight range, and while its long-term fundamentals remain supportive, its short-term technicals are flashing caution. What makes it all the more noteworthy is that the last time this exact setup appeared, the outcome was not kind to the bulls. Could history be about to repeat itself? Let’s jump in and take a closer look.\n\n→ Hi Ho Silver Away! Silver Breaks $80 as Poor Man's Gold Explodes\nWhat Qualcomm’s Bearish MACD Crossover Signals Now The MACD is a momentum indicator that tracks the relationship between two moving averages. When the shorter-term average crosses below the longer-term one, it’s regarded as a reliable signal that upside momentum is fading and that sellers are beginning to gain the upper hand. Importantly, this is not just an intraday wobble. The crossover that appeared just before Christmas has now continued and picked up pace into this week.\n\nThat matters because MACD signals tend to be more reliable when they appear after extended rallies. Qualcomm’s run since April has been one of its most sustained in years, and so this sudden divergence could be an early warning that buyers are starting to step back, rather than to continue building positions.\n→ D-Wave vs. IonQ vs. IBM vs. Google: Which Quantum Bets Will Win 2026?\nNow, it doesn’t mean a breakdown from here is inevitable. But it does suggest that the stock is vulnerable if bulls fail to step in soon, especially given how the stock behaved the last time this happened.\nThe Last Time QCOM Flashed This Signal, Shares Dropped 10% The most recent comparison point came less than two months ago in early November. At the time, Qualcomm had also printed a bearish MACD crossover after a strong move to multi-year highs. In a move that surprised us all, what followed was a swift decline of more than 10% over the following two weeks.\n\nStory Continues\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02\nThe setup then shares several similarities with today. The stock had been moving higher into the middle of December since bottoming out from November’s correction, but in the face of increased selling pressure over the past fortnight, the bulls have been nowhere to be seen.\n\nHistory might not repeat perfectly when it comes to stocks, but it often rhymes. The point isn’t so much that Qualcomm is definitely going to fall another 10% from here; it’s that, at the very least, the stock is flashing a warning signal that is worth noting.\nWhy This Qualcomm Setup Could Play Out Differently There are also reasons not to be overly negative. Unlike early November, Qualcomm hasn’t just retreated from a multi-year high, and is actually starting to trade within a tightening range. With the longer-term uptrend still intact, it could be said to have been coiling into a pre-breakout setup over the past week, more so than starting to break down.\n\nIts fundamentals also look as strong as they have all year, with expectations building for Qualcomm to once again top the consensus in their first earnings report of 2026, due in early February. As we’ve highlighted in recent weeks, too, investor perception has been improving as the company’s diversification efforts continue to build momentum.\nEspecially when the broader equity market is in risk-on mode, this underlying narrative supports higher prices over time, even if the near-term path is choppy. That longer-term view is supported by TradeSmith’s Health Indicator, a volatility-based metric that has consistently ranked Qualcomm in the green zone for six consecutive months.\n\nWhat Bulls Must Do for Qualcomm to Start 2026 Strong Still, for Qualcomm to start 2026 on the right foot, the bulls need to reassert control soon. If the stock continues to drift lower below $172, it would significantly increase the odds of another leg down similar to November’s move.\nConversely, if buyers step in and momentum begins to turn back up, this crossover could prove to be a false alarm within a broader uptrend. Having worked hard to shake off its reputation for exasperating investors with multiple false promises, Qualcomm has earned some benefit of the doubt after its strong performance since April, but that goodwill is not unlimited.\nThe next week or two will tell a lot. A stock can coil only for so long before it has to choose a direction, one way or the other. With its fundamentals pointing higher and technicals pulling in the opposite direction, Qualcomm is approaching a moment of decision.\nThe article \" The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10% \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Goldman Sachs Downgrades Arm Holdings (ARM) Amid Limited AI Cycle Exposure and Non-Traditional Market Challenges\n\nMaham Fatima\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ARM\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2026 . On December 15, Goldman Sachs downgraded Arm Holdings to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $120, which was brought down from $160. This decision was made as the firm updated its 2026 semiconductor sector outlook and predicted that rising AI spending by hyperscalers will support digital, memory, and storage markets, while a recovery in the automotive and industrial sectors should benefit analog chips. However, Goldman Sachs downgraded Arm Holdings due to its limited exposure to the AI cycle, its ongoing business model transition, and the challenges it faces in gaining traction across non-traditional markets.\n\nIn FQ2 2026, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) achieved its best FQ2 performance to date, with total revenue reaching $1.14 billion, which was a 34% increase year-on-year. This growth was fueled by record royalty revenue of $620 million (up 21%) and a massive 56% surge in licensing revenue, which totaled $515 million. The licensing spike reflects intense global demand for next-gen AI products and Arm Holdings’ high-efficiency compute architecture. The company also delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of its previous guidance.\nStrategically, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is positioning itself as the primary solution to the power bottlenecks currently hindering data center expansion. The company’s platform is approximately 50% more energy-efficient than its competitors, a factor that has led to widespread adoption by industry giants including Nvidia, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. This efficiency drove ARM’s Neoverse royalties to more than double year-on-year. Furthermore, the company announced a strategic partnership with Meta to optimize AI efficiency and revealed plans to acquire DreamBig Semiconductor to secure critical intellectual property for data center networking and high-speed communications.\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) architects, develops, and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies for semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.74%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.63%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.76%.\nComing into today, shares of the semiconductor maker had gained 0.68% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 0.14%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.79%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Analog Devices in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.28, showcasing a 39.88% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.11 billion, up 28.21% from the prior-year quarter.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $9.79 per share and a revenue of $12.82 billion, signifying shifts of +25.67% and +16.36%, respectively, from the last year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Analog Devices. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.52% higher. Analog Devices is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\nIn terms of valuation, Analog Devices is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.07. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 44.32 of its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, ADI's PEG ratio is currently 1.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.47.\nThe Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 31, which puts it in the top 13% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

      "Content": "Why Qualcomm (QCOM) Dipped More Than Broader Market Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) closed at $171.05 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.5% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.74%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.63%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.76%.\nComing into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 1.73% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 0.14%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.79%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Qualcomm in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $3.38, showcasing a 0.88% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.25 billion, up 4.99% from the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.15 per share and revenue of $45.69 billion, which would represent changes of +1% and +3.52%, respectively, from the prior year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Qualcomm. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.02% downward. Qualcomm is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nIn the context of valuation, Qualcomm is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 14.29. This denotes a discount relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 35.99.\n\nInvestors should also note that QCOM has a PEG ratio of 3.11 right now.

      "Content": "Tower Semiconductor Draws New $109 Million Institutional Stake Amid a 127% Stock Run\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 10:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nAPLD\n\nMTZ\n\nKey Points Florida-based Hood River Capital Management initiated a new stake in Tower Semiconductor, buying up 1.51 million shares in the third quarter.\nThe shares were worth about $109.22 million as of September 30.\nThe position places Tower Semiconductor outside the fund's top five holdings.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nFlorida-based Hood River Capital Management reported a new position in Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) valued at approximately $109.22 million, according to a November 14 SEC filing.\nWhat Happened Hood River Capital Management established a new position in Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) , acquiring 1.51 million shares valued at $109.22 million as of September 30, according to its SEC filing dated November 14. The new stake amounts to 1.29% of the fund’s $8.47 billion in reportable U.S. equity assets, raising its total number of holdings to 152 at quarter-end.\n\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:APLD: $482.81 million (5.7% of AUM)\nNYSE:MTZ: $350.38 million (4.13% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:KTOS: $246.07 million (2.91% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:DAVE: $215.46 million (2.54% of AUM)\nNYSE:FIX: $199.03 million (2.35% of AUM)\nAs of Wednesday, shares of Tower Semiconductor were priced at $118.08, up a staggering 127% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500's 17% gain in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.51 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$195.48 million\nPrice (as of Wednesday)\n$118.08\n\nCompany Snapshot Tower Semiconductor offers analog-intensive mixed-signal semiconductor devices, including SiGe, BiCMOS, RF CMOS, CMOS image sensors, integrated power management, and MEMS, as well as wafer fabrication and design enablement services.\nIt operates as an independent foundry, generating revenue through manufacturing and customizing semiconductor wafers for integrated device manufacturers and fabless companies on a contract basis.\nThe company serves a diversified customer base across consumer electronics, communications, automotive, industrial, aerospace, military, and medical device sectors worldwide.\n\nTower Semiconductor is a leading pure-play foundry specializing in analog and mixed-signal semiconductor manufacturing, with a global footprint and a workforce of over 5,600 employees. The company leverages advanced process technologies and a flexible manufacturing model to address specialized customer requirements in high-growth, high-reliability end markets. Its competitive edge is built on technology customization, deep industry expertise, and broad market reach across multiple geographies and applications.\n\nStory Continues\nFoolish Take This move shows conviction during a staggering stock run. Tower Semiconductor exited the third quarter with momentum across revenue, margins, and capital deployment. Revenue reached $396 million in the third quarter, up 6% sequentially, while net income climbed to $54 million, or $0.48 per share, reflecting operating leverage across its core platforms. Meanwhile, management’s guidance for a record $440 million of revenue in the fourth quarter underscores why some investors are still leaning in despite the stock’s sharp run-up.\n\nWhat also stands out is where Tower is spending. The company committed an additional $300 million to expand SiPho and SiGe capacity, targeting optical transceivers and data center demand, segments with structurally higher margins and long-duration growth drivers.\n\nAnd as for the broader context, this fund’s largest holdings skew toward higher-volatility growth names, suggesting Tower is being used as a quality compounder rather than a speculative swing.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable assets: Assets disclosed by institutional investment managers in quarterly SEC filings, covering U.S. equity holdings.\nAssets under management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or investment firm.\nTop holdings: The largest individual investments in a fund's portfolio, typically ranked by market value or portfolio weight.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nPure-play foundry: A semiconductor company that manufactures chips for other companies but does not design its own products.\nAnalog-intensive mixed-signal: Semiconductor devices combining analog and digital circuits, often used for processing real-world signals.\nSiGe: Silicon-germanium, a semiconductor material used to enhance performance in certain electronic devices.\nBiCMOS: A technology combining bipolar and CMOS transistors on a single chip for improved speed and power efficiency.\nRF CMOS: Radio frequency complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor; technology for integrating radio frequency circuits on standard CMOS chips.\nCMOS image sensors: Devices that convert light into electronic signals, widely used in cameras and imaging equipment.\nMEMS: Microelectromechanical systems; tiny mechanical devices built onto semiconductor chips for sensing or actuation.\nFabless companies: Firms that design semiconductor chips but outsource manufacturing to foundries rather than owning fabrication facilities.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is trading at an all-time high with the share price of $1,279.60 on December 26. This comes after impressive 100.59% year-to-date gains.\nWall Street is bullish ahead of the company’s fiscal Q2 2026 earnings, expected to be released on January 28. Analysts expect the company to post around $3.25 billion in revenue along with a GAAP EPS of $8.49. Recently, on December 19, Deutsche Bank reiterated a Hold rating on the stock without disclosing any price targets. Earlier, on December 16, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $1,400 to $1,450.\nArya of BofA noted that the US semiconductor stocks are attractively positioned for 2026. He sees 2026 as the halfway point of an 8-10 year-long cycle. Arya sees 2026 to be the year of faster IT upgradation, AI utilization, and AI workloads. He cautioned the investors regarding slight choppiness due to increased investor scrutiny on AI return on investment; however, this is expected to be offset by fast AI LLM builders and AI factories.\n\nThat said, on December 15, Blayne Curtis from Jefferies upgraded KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) from Market Perform to Outperform with a $1,500 price target. The analyst believes that the company enjoys a significant edge on a stronger leading edge/packaging outlook. The firm also has a constructive outlook on the wafer fab equipment growth in 2026 and 2027.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced process control equipment and services for the semiconductor and electronics industries, helping chipmakers find tiny defects, improve yields, and enhance quality in making logic chips, memory (like DRAM/NAND), LEDs, and more, essentially providing the high-tech tools to ensure flawless microchip production.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop Upgrades:\n\nKeefe Bruyette upgraded TeraWulf (WULF) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $24, up from $9.50. The firm believes investors are underestimating the magnitude of TeraWulf's bitcoin mining to high performance compute leasing mix shift in 2026 and 2027.\nClear Street upgraded Plug Power (PLUG) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $3, down from $3.50. The firm sees more attractive upside in the shares following the recent selloff. It cites dilution from Plug Power's convertible refinancing in late November for the target drop.\n\nTop Downgrades:\n\nWedbush downgraded GlobalFoundries (GFS) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $40, down from $42. While the firm believes that GlobalFoundries has a path to a model with stronger revenues, improved utilization, and better margins on improved end market fundamentals and a shift towards local supply chains, it also believes recent developments have elongated the timeframe around when those catalysts might play out, the firm tells investors.\nWedbush downgraded Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) to Neutral from Outperform with a $125 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade, noting that the stock is approaching the firm's target price and the 25-times multiple it uses to value Tower Semiconductor ostensibly already assumes some upside vs. its current estimates.\nTruist downgraded DigitalBridge (DBRG) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $16 following the announced all-cash acquisition by SoftBank Group (SFTBY) at $16 per share. The firm sees a low probability of a competing bid emerging.\nRaymond James double downgraded OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) to Market Perform from Strong Buy without a price target following the company's announcement to acquire Flushing Financial (FFIC) . The firm expects \"significant\" dilution and says the deal slows the benefit of OceanFirst's shift to a stronger core deposit franchise.\nRaymond James downgraded Flushing Financial (FFIC) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company agreed to be acquired by OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) . The deal was done at a fair price given the earnings challenges Flushing has faced due to the challenging rate environment for the past several years, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop Initiations:\n\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Serve Robotics (SERV) with a Buy rating and $16 price target. The firm believes Serve is positioned for \"strong growth and eventual profitability.\"\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of International Bancshares (IBOC) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. While the bank has elevated commercial real estate concentration, interest-rate sensitivity, and exposure to cross-border activity, the firm sees these factors being balanced by strong profitability supported by \"best-in-class\" efficiency and conservative balance sheet positioning.\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Butterfly Network (BFLY) with a Buy rating and $5 price target. The firm sees continued revenue expansion for Butterfly, driven by iQ3 probe and enterprise software adoption.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Analog Devices (ADI): Read This Before Placing a Bet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADI Check price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Analog Devices, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ADI Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $9.79.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices.

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Silicon Motion falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Silicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share, indicating a change of +44% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 points to a change of +3.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.88 indicates a change of +37.5% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nStory continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $260.55 million indicates a year-over-year change of +36.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $863.29 million and $1.05 billion estimates indicate +7.4% and +21.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $242 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.07 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.52%. The EPS surprise was +23.46%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Can Qualcomm Stock Benefit From a Foray Into Mid-Range AI Chips?\n\nSupriyo Bose\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 5:23 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nMSFT\n\nARM\n\nQualcomm Incorporated QCOM has forayed into mid-range AI desktops and laptops with its Snapdragon X chip. This SoC is the fourth such product in the Snapdragon X processor line, following the successful launch of the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite series. Based on a 4-nanometer process, the Snapdragon X chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs – Microsoft’s vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware.\n\nAI PCs incorporate an additional processor designed specifically to accelerate AI capabilities. This specialized hardware enhances features like personal assistants and task automation. One of the significant selling points of AI PCs is their enhanced battery life. Qualcomm's chips, which are based on Arm Holdings Plc designs, promise extended use without frequent charging.\n\nLeveraging processors with multi-core CPUs with cutting-edge features, amazing graphics and worldwide network connectivity, Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platforms are fast and have superb power efficiency. Smartphones and mobile devices built with Snapdragon mobile platforms enable immersive augmented reality and virtual reality experiences, brilliant camera capabilities, superior 4G LTE and 5G connectivity with state-of-the-art security solutions.\n\nTech Firms Focusing on AI NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is rapidly gaining traction in enterprise AI, expanding its market beyond cloud providers. Major companies across industries are integrating NVIDIA’s AI platforms to automate workflows, enhance productivity and improve decision-making. The company’s DGX Cloud AI infrastructure, which allows enterprises to train and deploy AI models at scale, has seen increased adoption. The expansion of CUDA software and AI frameworks strengthens NVIDIA’s ecosystem, making it the preferred choice for enterprises developing AI applications. With AI adoption expected to accelerate in 2025 and beyond, NVIDIA’s software and AI cloud solutions are a significant revenue driver.\n\nIntel Corporation INTC is investing to expand its manufacturing capacity to accelerate its IDM 2.0 (Integrated Device Manufacturing) strategy. The company is taking various decisions to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector. Its Xeon 6 processors with Performance-cores (P-Cores) can support large AI workloads across diverse sectors. With industry-leading capabilities in AI processing, the Xeon 6 family delivers the industry’s best CPU for AI at a lower total cost of ownership. Intel's innovative AI solutions are likely to benefit the broader semiconductor ecosystem by driving down costs, improving performance and fostering an open, scalable AI environment.\n\nStory Continues\nQCOM’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Qualcomm’s shares have gained 13% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 41%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/earnings ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 14.16 forward earnings, lower than 34.14 for the industry.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for fiscal 2026 have increased 2% to $12.15 per share over the past 60 days, while the same for fiscal 2027 are up 3.4% to $12.6.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "KLA (KLAC) Suffers a Larger Drop Than the General Market: Key Insights\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nKLA (KLAC) ended the recent trading session at $1,243.65, demonstrating a -1.33% change from the preceding day's closing price. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.14%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.24%.\nThe maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors's stock has climbed by 8.92% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.94%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of KLA in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $8.75, up 6.71% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $3.24 billion, indicating a 5.39% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nKLAC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $35.44 per share and revenue of $13.04 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.49% and +7.31%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for KLA. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.1% upward. KLA is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\nIn the context of valuation, KLA is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 35.57. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.48, so one might conclude that KLA is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that KLAC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.36. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Miscellaneous Products was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.9 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 79, this industry ranks in the top 32% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "PLTR vs. ARM: Which AI-Tech Stock is the Better Buy Now?\n\nShuvra Shankar Dey\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nARM\n\nPalantir Technologies PLTR and Arm Holdings ARM are both deeply aligned with the same powerful theme: the accelerating global adoption of artificial intelligence. Each plays a foundational role in enabling AI at scale.\nPalantir supports AI deployment through sophisticated data integration, analytics and decision-making platforms that help organizations operationalize complex data. ARM underpins AI progress at the hardware level by licensing energy-efficient processor architectures that power AI workloads across mobile devices, cloud infrastructure and data centers. While their offerings differ, both companies occupy critical points in the AI value chain, directly benefiting from the rising demand for intelligent, scalable computing solutions from enterprises, governments and consumers.\n\nThe Case for PLTR Palantir has strategically positioned itself to capitalize on the changing dynamics of the AI economy.\nAt the core of Palantir’s strategy is its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which enables businesses to structure and organize their data, whether financial, supply chain, operational or HR-related, so that AI can process and execute tasks more effectively. By leveraging an ontology-driven approach, Palantir creates digital representations of entire enterprises, allowing AI to interact seamlessly with business operations. Unlike companies that contribute to the oversupply of AI models, Palantir is actively shaping the demand side of the AI economy, positioning itself as a key player in the adoption of enterprise AI.\n\nPalantir’s financial health further reinforces its investment appeal. As of Sept. 30, 2025, the company held $6.4 billion in cash and equivalents, with zero debt, providing ample liquidity to invest in growth initiatives.\nMoreover, Palantir’s recent financial performance underscores its strength. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues surged 63% year over year, with U.S. revenues increasing 77% year over year and U.S. commercial business experiencing 121% growth. The company closed 204 deals of at least $1 million, 91 deals of at least $5 million and 53 deals of at least $10 million in the quarter.\nThe company achieved its highest-ever adjusted operating margin of 51%, reflecting the scalability of its software business model and disciplined cost control. GAAP operating income reached $393 million, while GAAP net income came in at $476 million, translating to GAAP EPS of 18 cents and adjusted EPS of 21 cents, which increased 110% year over year.\n\nThe Case for ARM Arm Holdings’ foundational advantage in power-efficient chip architecture continues to anchor its dominance in mobile computing, but its influence extends far beyond smartphones and tablets. Long known for enabling energy-saving designs for Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Samsung, Arm is becoming increasingly central as these companies accelerate their focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nStory Continues\nARM’s unique ability to deliver high performance with minimal power makes its architecture ideal for an era where intelligence is embedded everywhere, from wearables to edge devices and cloud infrastructure. AI models are being deployed across a wide array of consumer and enterprise products, and Arm’s flexible, power-thrifty designs are being adopted to support these new workloads. Apple continues to rely on ARM-based architecture for its M-series chips as it deepens AI integration across its devices. Qualcomm is using ARM designs to drive AI-enhanced smartphones and automotive platforms, while Samsung leverages ARM’s technology across mobile, consumer electronics and its expanding Exynos portfolio targeting AI and IoT applications.\n\nThe reliance of these major tech players on Arm Holdings is not only consistent but also strengthening. As Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung scale their AI ambitions and broaden their IoT ecosystems, they depend even more on ARM’s ability to deliver power-efficient performance at global scale. The company’s ongoing push to optimize its architecture for machine learning and edge computing ensures tight alignment with the emerging needs of its top customers.\nAs a result, Arm Holdings is evolving from a mobile-centric enabler to a critical AI and IoT infrastructure layer for the world’s leading device makers, solidifying its strategic importance across the broader technology landscape.\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for PLTR & ARM? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR’s 2025 sales and EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 54% and 78%, respectively. EPS estimates have been trending upward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARM’s fiscal 2026 sales and EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 21.5% and 5.5%, respectively. EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nARM’s Valuation More Attractive Than PLTR While ARM appears attractively valued with a forward 12-month P/E of 52.93X versus its median of 121.35X, suggesting that the stock could be undervalued relative to its historical range, PLTR is trading at a forward 12-month P/E of 177.24X, below its 12-month median of 308.7X.\nPLTR Seems a Choice In the current AI-driven market environment, Palantir stands out as the more compelling choice. While both companies benefit from long-term AI adoption, Palantir is more directly tied to real-world AI execution and enterprise decision-making. Its platforms are already embedded in mission-critical operations across commercial and government sectors, creating durable demand and high switching costs. Palantir’s focus on operational AI positions it on the front lines of adoption rather than infrastructure dependency. With stronger momentum, clearer AI monetization and a Buy rating compared with Arm’s Hold stance, Palantir offers greater upside for investors seeking exposure to AI as a transformative business force rather than a supporting technology layer.\n\nWhile PLTR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), ARM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in KLA Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\nFor most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in KLA (KLAC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to KLAC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nKLA's Business In-Depth With that in mind, let's take a look at KLA's main business drivers.\nSan Jose, CA-based KLA Corporation is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of process diagnostics and control (PDC) equipment and yield management solutions required for the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) or chips. The company has a comprehensive portfolio of products addressing each major PDC subsegment&mdash;photomask (reticle) inspection, wafer inspection/defect review and metrology.\n\nReticle production is vital to the semiconductor device formation process. Reticles are used to control the precise deposition of materials onto the wafer, which ultimately change its chemical characteristics, imparting specific functionalities to the ICs thus created. Inspection and metrology tools measure the quality of the reticles, helping to improve reticle production yields. As a result of the broader applicability of semiconductors, shrinking form factors and increasing functionalities of individual chips, reticle design and production are growing in importance. Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor were the largest customers in the last three years, accounting for more than 10% of total sales in each year.\n\nKLA reported revenues of $12.16 billion in fiscal 2025. Product revenues accounted for 78% while the rest came from Service segment.\n\nKLA&rsquo;s two main product lines are defect inspection and metrology. The company&rsquo;s defect inspection tools have very broad application in chip, wafer, reticle, storage, compound semiconductor and MEMS manufacturing. Metrology tools are used to gather critical dimension measurements of the wafer and process dimensions such as film thickness, lithography overlay and surface profiling. The company&rsquo;s metrology products are used in chip, wafer, reticle and solar device manufacturing. KLA also offers other products and services.\n\nIn addition to new tools, KLA also offers a comprehensive portfolio of refurbished tools that upgrade and improve yields of existing equipment under the KT-Certified program. Refurbished tools are currently sold to IC, reticle, substrate, MEMS and data storage manufacturers.\n\nAlthough KLA is a major player in each of its served markets, it faces competition from other large equipment suppliers such as Applied Materials and Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation.\n\nStory Continues\nBottom Line While anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in KLA ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in December 2015 would be worth $18,031.33, or a 1,703.13% gain, as of December 30, 2025, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 232.27% and the price of gold increased 293.02% over the same time frame in comparison.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for KLAC.\nKLA's fiscal first-quarter revenues and earnings increased year over year. The uptick can be attributed to strong demand in leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging, which drove growth in the semiconductor industry. Advanced packaging is expected to exceed $925 million in 2025. The company's robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. The services business also performed well, contributing significantly to revenue growth. KLA is well-positioned to capitalize on AI advancements, with AI driving demand for higher-value wafer processing and more complex designs. However, extended U.S. export controls on China impacted revenues in the reported quarter. Tariff-related uncertainties also impacted the company's performance.\nThe stock is up 8.92% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2025. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

AAPL, Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and IBM Corp. IBM.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop Research Reports for Apple, Cisco & IBM\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc. and IBM Corp.

The company is benefiting from strong growth in its Services revenues. The company now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The new iPhone 17 series is expected to drive top-line growth. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy.\n\nApple expects the December quarter&rsquo;s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) net sales to grow between 10% and 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company expects iPhone sales to grow in double digits year over year. The Mac segment is expected to face a tough year-over-year comparison, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate.\n\nHowever, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> )\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past six months (+14% vs. +13.6%). The company&rsquo;s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk's acquisition enhances the company&rsquo;s recurring revenue base.\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco&rsquo;s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco&rsquo;s security portfolio.\n\nNetworking sales benefited from strong demand for AI infrastructure and campus networking solutions. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers were strong driven by high double-digit order growth in hyperscalers. However, stiffening competition is a headwind.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>> )\n\nIBM&rsquo;s shares have gained +4.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry&rsquo;s gain of +47.8%. The company is betting big on the Watsonx platform, which is likely to be its core technology platform for AI capabilities. The company&rsquo;s focus on quantum technology for solutions to complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing is a tailwind.\n\nIBM is benefiting from a surge in demand for heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has led to sustainable growth through advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nHowever, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Macroeconomic headwinds are worrisome. IBM&rsquo;s acquisition spree has also escalated integration risks, while its high debt level is burdensome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> )\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI, Johnson & Johnson&rsquo;s JNJ, The Gap, Inc. GAP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop 5 High-Yield S&P 500 Stock to Buy for 2026\nThe U.S. stock market has experienced significant volatility at the beginning of 2025 owing to a multitude of factors. The trade policy framework undertaken in the new Trump administration has reshaped market sentiment. The aggressive tariff measures imposed by Washington on its major trading partners have left several businesses in a state of uncertainty. The growing Sino-U.S. trade tension was a concerning factor for investors. The U.S. government aims to limit Beijing&rsquo;s access to high-end technologies. It has imposed restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor tech to China.\nThe tariff-related uncertainties have significantly affected companies with a strong presence in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Moreover, the war in Europe and the Middle East has further aggravated the market uncertainty. These developments have led to rising manufacturing costs and supply chain issues, putting pressure on margins. However, there were some positive macroeconomic developments as well in 2025. The federal reserve rate cuts have lowered borrowing costs and improved corporate profitability.\n\nTrade-related risks and changes in monetary policy led to frequent stock price fluctuations. However, broader market momentum remained positive with tech stocks largely leading the bull run. Growing spending on AI infrastructure and digital transformation is driving growth in the tech sector. Despite a hike in energy prices, the overall annual inflation rate was lower than expected in 2025.\nKey Growth Drivers for 2026\nRapid AI buildouts are expected to be a key driver for businesses in 2026. Businesses in several industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, social ecommerce, telecom and others are rapidly incorporating AI across the portfolio to gain a competitive edge. However, this rapid AI build-out requires substantial computing infrastructure, data centers to support these AI workloads, as well as energy optimization and cooling technologies.\n\nStory Continues\nAI integration has become capex-heavy. There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.\n\nChina is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government&rsquo;s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.\nAmid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.\n\nKey Picks\nInternational Business Machines Corp. : Headquartered in Armonk, NY, IBM is a leading provider of cloud and data platforms.

      "Content": "CRDO vs. MRVL: Which Data Center Connectivity Stock Is Smarter Pick?\n\nVaishali Doshi\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRDO\n\nMRVL\n\nCredo Technology Group Holding Ltd . ( CRDO ) and Marvell Technology, Inc . ( MRVL ) are semiconductor companies that specialize in high-speed connectivity solutions that are essential for AI-driven data centers.\nAmid rapid artificial intelligence (AI) proliferation, investors are focusing on companies that offer the infrastructure behind it. Semiconductor companies are at the core of AI workloads as these offer solutions to enable augmented processing power and efficiency. CRDO and Marvell are key players in this domain and bring to the table unique strengths. This makes it an intriguing comparison for investors.\n\nNow the question arises: which stock makes a better investment pick at present? Let us dive into the fundamentals, valuations, growth outlook and risks for each company.\nThe Case for CRDO Credo’s leadership in the AEC space is one of its biggest catalysts. AEC business remains its fastest-growing segment. CRDO noted that AECs, now scaling to 100-gig per lane and transitioning to 200-gig per lane architectures, have become the “de facto” standard for inter-rack connectivity. These are now replacing optical rack-to-rack connections of up to 7 meters. The increasing adoption of zero-flap AECs is mainly due to these cables offering up to 1,000 times more reliability with 50% lower power consumption than optical solutions, added CRDO.\n\nBeyond AECs, Credo’s IC portfolio, which includes retimers and optical DSPs, continued to show a healthy performance. Credo’s PCIe retimer program remains on track for design wins in fiscal 2026 and revenue contributions in the next fiscal year.\nOne of the most important recent developments for Credo is its introduction of three growth pillars, each representing a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. These include Zero-Flap (“ZF”) optics, active LED cables (ALCs) and OmniConnect gearboxes (Weaver).\nZF optics is a laser-based connectivity solution delivering AEC-level reliability through a custom optical DSP tightly integrated with Credo’s software stack. The optics are already in live data-center trials, with sampling to a second U.S. hyperscaler expected later in fiscal 2026. ALCs utilize micro-LEDs, delivering AEC-level reliability and power efficiency, and support up to 30-meter connections for row-scale data center networks. Sampling is planned for fiscal 2027, with revenues in fiscal 2028. Credo expects the ALC market to grow to more than twice the size of the AEC market. OmniConnect gearboxes are designed to optimize XDU connectivity.\nCredo now has five main high-growth pillars — AECs, IC solutions (retimers and optical DSPs), Zero-Flap optics, ALCs and OmniConnect gearboxes. Collectively, these present a total market opportunity likely to surpass $10 billion, more than tripling Credo’s market reach just 18 months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Case for MRVL Marvell is a semiconductor company with a diversified product portfolio that includes custom ASICs, data center switches and 5G chips. The company’s strategic pivot to prioritize the data center market is proving to be a successful growth catalyst. The data center end market emerged as the company's largest segment, with revenue contribution of 73% in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. The company's custom XPU silicon, electro-optic interconnect products and next-generation switch offerings are the primary drivers of its strong data center performance.\n\nInterconnect business remains impressive. The increasing demand for AECs and retimers, driven by the shift to high-speed PAM-based solutions, is likely to drive revenues from this segment moving forward. It has been working with the cable ecosystem to enable 100 and 200 gig per lane AECs and is likely to begin significant product ramps. It also noted that PCIe Gen6 retimers are also witnessing “broad traction.”\nThe data center switching business remains another catalyst with revenues expected to exceed $300 million in fiscal 2026 and top $500 million in fiscal 2027. Drivers include sustained demand for 12.8T platforms and accelerating ramps of next-generation 51.2T switches. Meanwhile, development is underway for 100T architectures, which are set to be introduced next year.\n\nThe company has been divesting non-core assets (like the Automotive Ethernet business) while layering in acquisitions, such as Avera, Aquantia , Inphi and Innovium , and now Celestial AI (expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027). Celestial AI specializes in the Photonic Fabric technology platform. This platform is purpose-built for scale-up optical interconnect. Management highlighted that Celestial AI is “deeply engaged” with several hyperscalers and ecosystem partners. Celestial AI has already won a major contract with one of the biggest hyperscalers. This hyperscaler intends to use the photonic fabric chiplets in its next-generation scale-up architecture.\nStrong cash flow and subsequent buybacks enhance Marvell’s appeal. Marvell has returned $1.35 billion through buybacks (including ASR) and dividends in the fiscal third quarter, highlighting financial flexibility even while investing.\n\nPrice Performances & Valuations of CRDO & MRVL In the past month, CRDO and MRVL have declined 15.3% and 5.2%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price/sales ratio, Credo is trading at 17.53X, higher than Marvell’s 7.44X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO? Analysts have revised earnings estimates 30% upward for CRDO for the current fiscal year in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThere is a marginal upward revision for MRVL’s bottom line\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCRDO or MRVL: Which Is a Better Pick? Credo and Marvell are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI-driven data center market.\nCRDO currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Marvell carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Is Marvell (MRVL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Marvell Technology (MRVL).\n\nMarvell currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 24 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 5.6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MRVL Check price target & stock forecast for Marvell here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Marvell, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in MRVL? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marvell, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.1% over the past month to $2.84.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marvell.

      "Content": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Is Using Debt Safely\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nDavid Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhen Is Debt A Problem? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Analog Devices Carry? The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at November 2025 Analog Devices had debt of US$8.60b, up from US$7.62b in one year. However, it also had US$3.65b in cash, and so its net debt is US$4.95b.\nHow Strong Is Analog Devices' Balance Sheet? According to the last reported balance sheet, Analog Devices had liabilities of US$3.25b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$10.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.65b in cash and US$1.44b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$9.09b.\n\nOf course, Analog Devices has a titanic market capitalization of US$135.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nStory Continues\nAnalog Devices's net debt is only 0.99 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 14.1 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, Analog Devices grew its EBIT by 45% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Analog Devices can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Analog Devices actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.\nOur View The good news is that Analog Devices's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. It looks Analog Devices has no trouble standing on its own two feet, and it has no reason to fear its lenders. For investing nerds like us its balance sheet is almost charming. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Analog Devices you should know about.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

      "Content": "【時報記者王逸芯台北報導】智原（3035）旗下小金雞、32位元微控制器（MCU）設計廠雅特力-KY（6907）預計於明年1月在櫃買中心掛牌。智原董事長、同時也是雅特力-KY董事長王國雍今日表示，目前公司營運表現相當不錯，雅特力持續深耕主流MCU應用，並從中尋找可發揮的利基市場，包括機器人、無人機以及電競等新興應用，看好今年營收可望再優於去年，對明年展望亦抱持正向態度。\n\n王國雍指出，MCU本身是一項可銷售十年以上的產品，但實際上單一客戶的使用週期可能僅兩至三年，在工控等應用中則可能拉長至十年不等，因此公司在營運評估上，會更著重整體底站與出貨結構。目前公司整體狀況良好，去年營收年增達60%，在整體MCU市場仍承壓之際，已率先繳出明顯成長成績；今年營收預期將再優於去年，且底站動能仍接近歷史高點水準，為明年營運奠定穩定基礎。\n\n王國雍進一步表示，第四季多項晶片幾乎銷售一空，目前正積極推動晶圓代工產能加量，主因新應用放量速度快，例如無人機等需求持續拉升，部分客戶甚至出現供貨吃緊的情況。從庫存面來看，無論是代理商、經銷商或終端客戶端，整體庫存水位皆偏低，也成為支撐明年營運的重要正向指標。\n\n雅特力-KY亦積極布局車用及特殊MCU應用領域。副總經理黃呈俊指出，車用市場的應用範圍相當廣泛，目前公司產品已通過AEC-Q100認證，車用應用本身也具備多個層次，公司現階段著力較多的是車載、耐用度要求較高、且具備實際出貨量的應用領域，整體車用相關營收占比約在一成多。至於AI與機器人應用，公司認為目前仍處於產業初期，但更看重其中長期成長潛力。\n\n針對MCU市場競爭態勢，王國雍表示，若晶片功能單純，確實難以做出差異化，這也是8位元市場高度內捲的主因；但在32位元MCU領域，公司採取全產品公規策略，涵蓋多元應用，即使導入車規相關設計，也不僅限於汽車市場，而是透過高規格品質驗證，提升其他高可靠度應用客戶的信任感。\n\n黃呈俊補充，所謂「內捲」在任何產業競爭中其實都是長期存在的現象，但MCU所屬產業結構相對特殊，具備少量多樣、客群分散、屬於長期且穩定的常態性市場特性，並非典型的「贏者全拿」型產業；相較外商競爭對手，公司在價格策略上更具彈性，能提供具吸引力的報價，但產品效能並不遜色。若與大陸廠商相比，公司則在產品品質與可靠度上更具優勢，這與台灣半導體產業長期累積的技術基礎與製造經驗密不可分。實務上，一項產品動輒數千美元，客戶不會因為幾毛美元的價差輕易更換供應商，因為整體系統導入涉及龐大的工程成本與時間投入，最終仍高度仰賴品牌信任與長期穩定性；也因此，即便市場競爭激烈、價格壓力升高，公司仍能在內捲環境中以產品、品質與服務正面競爭，維持長期競爭力。\n\n營收占比上，雅特力-KY 目前大陸市場營收占比約落在八成至九成之間，部分時間點甚至接近九成，不過整體結構也正逐步出現變化，這與地緣政治因素及產業供需循環有一定關聯。從國際競爭來看，主要對手為ST（意法半導體），其在疫情初期因大缺貨，與多家客戶簽訂長期供貨合約，隨著這幾年市場逐步去化，部分韓國等海外客戶的長約已陸續到期，公司在海外市場，包括韓國、台灣及亞太地區品牌的設計導入與用量明顯回升，像電競領域已成功打入全球最大電競品牌廠。整體來看，台灣與海外營收占比已由過去約一成出頭，逐步往11%、12%以上提升，但由於大陸市場營收同步成長，兩者在比例上仍呈現拉鋸狀態，目前台灣加海外合計約占十多個百分點。",
