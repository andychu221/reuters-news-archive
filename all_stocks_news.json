      "Content": "Veteran analyst delivers blunt 3-word take on Tesla after report\n\nMoz Farooque\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 12:13 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n“ Better than feared. ”\nThat’s the three-word verdict from Wedbush’s Dan Ives after Tesla ( TSLA ) reported its latest lackluster production and delivery numbers.\nWith most leaning bearish, Ives' take wasn’t the reaction investors were expecting.\nTesla’s delivery numbers came in behind internal targets, but landed close enough to Wall Street ’s expectations.\n\nDeliveries are under duress following the loss of the critical $7,500 U.S. tax credit, along with ongoing weakness across Europe. Still, the overall report pointed to stability instead of deterioration.\nHowever, having covered Tesla for years, this isn’t the same EV-centric company it once was.\nIves is echoing the same sentiment, saying investors are judging Tesla on more than just quarterly car deliveries, but also on AI , energy, and autonomy.\nCEO Elon Musk made that point clear on Tesla’s Q4 2024 earnings call .\nFor these reasons, we could see a new-look Tesla, with multiple AI and autonomy catalysts masking weaknesses in its core EV business.\nWhat Tesla’s Q4 numbers say At first glance, Tesla ’s Q4 and full-year 2025 production and delivery report was another headline miss.\nHere’s where the numbers actually stand.\nQ4 2025 deliveries: 418,227 vehicles , about 1.1% behind Tesla’s company-compiled analyst consensus of 422,850 and nearly 3.4% under Visible Alpha’s 432,810 estimate.\nQ4 2025 production: 434,358 vehicles , lagging Bloomberg’s cited consensus of 470,780 by about 7.7% .\nFull-year 2025 deliveries: 1,636,129 vehicles , mostly in line with Tesla’s compiled consensus of 1,640,752 and close to third-party expectations of about 1.65 million .\nFull-year 2025 production: 1,654,667 vehicles , which means Tesla produced slightly more than it delivered.\nEnergy storage (Q4): 14.2 GWh deployed , a record quarter , beating Tesla’s compiled consensus of 13.4 GWh by nearly 6% .\n\nIves sees Tesla on firm ground heading into 2026 Veteran Tesla bull Dan Ives feels the gap between production and delivery numbers was small enough to avoid raising any major red flags.\nIves also believes that Tesla faces significant challenges in achieving delivery growth again, particularly after the loss of the EV tax credit in Q3 and European headwinds.\n\nHowever, with deliveries more or less matching expectations, he feels Tesla enters 2026 in a strong position.\nRelated: Top analyst resets price target on Micron stock\nPerhaps the brightest spot is its energy business, where deployments jumped to 46.7 gigawatt-hours for the year.\nMore importantly, though, Ives reiterated the importance of AI, Full Self-Driving, Optimus robotics, and Robotaxis in 2026.\nHe keeps a buy rating on Tesla stock, with a massive $600 price target .\nFor perspective, that’s the highest rating on Wall Street.\nAnalysts stay divided on Tesla’s upside from here Tesla stock is currently trading near $438 after releasing its latest delivery report.\nThe past week has been tough for the stock (down 8%), but it capped off 2025 in the green, delivering a 16% gain .\nWhen I last covered Tesla stock (December 18, 2025), it was trading at $483.37 , so it has since declined by roughly 9.4% .\n\nRelated: Morgan Stanley drops surprising message on tech stocks\nNevertheless, it’s still trading at what bears would call a nosebleed valuation , at 268 times non-GAAP forward earnings .\nThat said, here’s where the big banks and major analysts are pegging the stock right now.\nDeutsche Bank : $500 price target (+14%) — stays buy, leaning into the Robotaxi/AI narrative.\nBofA Securities : $471 price target (+8%) — raised target but kept a neutral stance, calling Tesla the “physical AI” leader while raising concerns over its valuation. Source: Investing.com\nGoldman Sachs : $420 price target (-4%) — nudged its target higher, but it’s still sitting below the tape.\nMorgan Stanley : $425 price target (-3%) — equal weight, with Robotaxi framed as the key catalyst for the first half of 2026. Source: Investing.com\nUBS : $247 price target (-44%) — sell, arguing the stock’s pricing in too much autonomy upside too soon. Source: Investing.com\n\nA choppy year put Tesla’s Q4 in context Tesla ’s 2025 delivery story has been anything but smooth.\nThe year 2025 began with a major stumble, as Tesla’s Q1 deliveries slid to 336,681 , primarily due to Model Y line changeovers, effectively sidelining production for weeks.\nQ2 brought improvement with 384,122 deliveries, but it still felt more like grinding progress than a real comeback.\n\nMore Tesla:\nTop-rated analyst drops curt 8-word take on Tesla stock\nTesla investors may miss game-changing move\nJudge orders Tesla to make major change or halt sales in California\nRivian doubles down on new plan to beat Tesla\nQ3 then changed the tone with deliveries surging to 497,099 , turning into Tesla’s best quarter of last year, driven mainly by customers rushing to access the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit before it expired.\nAdditionally, the competition only adds to the current context.\nChinese EV giant BYD yet again ended last year emphatically, selling 4.6 million vehicles , which includes nearly 2.26 million battery EVs , The Guardian reported, blowing past Tesla’s 1.64 million haul .\nMoreover, rivals including Geely , NIO , and Li Auto also posted impressive late-year numbers, highlighting the unforgiving nature of the EV landscape for Tesla.\nRelated: Analyst who nailed 2020 lows drops take on S&P 500\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 4, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Is Apple’s Valuation Still Justified After AI Push and Recent Share Price Drop?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 12:11 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nWondering if Apple still looks attractive at today's levels, or if most of the upside has already been realized? This breakdown will help you decide whether the current price really matches the story.\nDespite dipping around 0.9% over the last week and 2.8% over the past month, Apple is still up 11.9% over the last year and 112.2% over three years. This shows that long term holders have been well rewarded even as short term sentiment has wobbled.\nRecent headlines have focused on Apple's ongoing push into AI features across its devices and ecosystem, along with regulatory scrutiny around its App Store practices and broader tech competition. Together, these themes help explain why the market has been periodically reassessing both Apple's potential growth and its risk profile.\nRight now, Apple scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks , suggesting the stock only screens as undervalued on one of six measures. Next, we will unpack the popular valuation approaches investors rely on, and then finish with a more nuanced way to think about what Apple might really be worth.\n\nApple scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Apple Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future, then discounting those cash flows back to today in $ terms.\nFor Apple, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $99.9 billion. Analysts and the model expect this to rise steadily, with projected Free Cash Flow of around $184.1 billion by 2030. Near term projections are based on analyst estimates, while later years are extrapolated using Simply Wall St assumptions to create a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of roughly $223.60 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies Apple is about 21.2% overvalued on this metric. This suggests the market is paying a premium to the model’s cash flow based estimate.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Apple may be overvalued by 21.2%. Discover 875 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Apple.\nApproach 2: Apple Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Apple, the Price to Earnings ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are willing to pay today for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or greater uncertainty should translate into a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nStory Continues\nApple currently trades on a PE of about 35.8x. That is well above the broader Tech industry average of roughly 23.0x, and also a premium to its peer group, which sits around 33.0x. On the surface, that suggests investors are paying up for Apple relative to both its sector and close comparables.\nSimply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework estimates that, given Apple’s growth profile, profit margins, size and risk factors, a more appropriate PE would be closer to 37.7x. This Fair Ratio is more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it explicitly bakes in company specific fundamentals instead of assuming all tech stocks deserve the same multiple. Since Apple’s actual PE of 35.8x is slightly below this 37.7x Fair Ratio, the shares appear modestly undervalued on this metric.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1464 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Apple Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to attach your story about Apple to the numbers by setting your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins, and a fair value estimate. A Narrative connects three pieces together: the business story you believe, the financial forecast that flows from it, and the fair value that drops out at the end. On Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page used by millions of investors, where you can quickly choose or adjust a Narrative instead of rebuilding a model from scratch. Narratives can then help you decide whether to buy, hold, or sell by comparing your Fair Value to today’s share price, and they update dynamically as new earnings, news, or guidance arrive so your view does not go stale. For example, some Apple Narratives currently see fair value near $177, while others are closer to $287, reflecting how cautious and optimistic investors can look at the same company and still reach very different, but clearly quantified, conclusions.\n\nFor Apple however we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Apple Narratives:\n🐂 Apple Bull Case\nFair value: $275.00\nImplied undervaluation vs last close: approximately -2.9%\nRevenue growth assumption: 12.78%\nSees the recent near 35% share price drop as an overreaction to steep U.S. tariffs on China assembled iPhones, with Apple actively shifting production to India and Vietnam and pursuing exemptions.\nHighlights resilient fundamentals, including Q1 2025 profit of $36.33 billion that beat expectations and record $26.3 billion services revenue, alongside a \"Moderate Buy\" analyst consensus and a mean target of $251.72.\nArgues that AI investments, strong brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams position Apple for long term recovery and growth despite short term geopolitical and supply chain volatility.\n\n🐻 Apple Bear Case\nFair value: $177.34\nImplied overvaluation vs last close: approximately 52.9%\nRevenue growth assumption: 14.68%\nViews Apple as significantly overvalued, pointing to a P/E multiple well above the market given moderating growth and maturing product lines, especially the iPhone.\nFlags slowing hardware momentum, margin pressure from rising costs and lower priced products, and heavy dependence on China amid intensifying local competition and geopolitical risk.\nArgues that large cash reserves are not being deployed aggressively into transformative innovation, so the market's optimism and lofty valuation leave the stock vulnerable to a correction.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Apple?

      "Content": "在全球供應鏈重組與「美國製造」政策推動之下，台積電加速擴大美國布局，但是高昂的生產成本正對獲利能力形成明顯壓力。Wccftech網站引用SemiAnalysis資料指出，台積電在美國設廠後，單位晶圓毛利率與台灣相比出現巨大落差，主因在於人力成本與晶圓折舊費用大幅攀升。\n\n根據分析師彙整的數據，台積電台灣晶圓廠每片晶圓的人力成本約1,800美元，美國晶圓廠則高達3,600美元，整整高出1倍。在晶圓折舊方面差距更為驚人，台灣廠每片晶圓折舊費用約1,500美元，美國廠卻高達7,289美元，是台灣廠的4倍以上。受此影響，台灣晶圓廠單片晶圓毛利率約62％，美國晶圓廠僅約8％，幾乎只剩八分之一。\n\n所謂晶圓折舊，指的是晶圓廠建設與設備投資在使用年限內的成本攤提。由於美國晶圓廠產能規模與產能利用率相對較低，即便採用相同製程技術，單位產出的固定成本卻必須由更少的晶圓分攤，導致每片晶圓承擔更高的「固定費用」，進一步侵蝕毛利空間。\n\n此外，美國高昂的人力成本亦成為沉重負擔。為支撐美國晶圓廠運作，台積電必須要在聘用當地員工與從台灣派遣工程師之間做出取捨。無論採取何種方式，整體用人成本皆明顯高過於台灣，成為影響營運效率的重要因素。\n\n市場人士指出，這也是台積電亞利桑那州晶圓廠近期出現獲利下滑的主要原因。在建廠成本、營運費用與折舊壓力同步放大的情況下，美國生產晶片的經濟性仍有待時間與規模放大來改善。\n\n儘管短期毛利承壓，台積電推進美國布局的戰略意義依然明確。此舉有助於分散地緣政治風險，確保關鍵客戶在不同地區都能取得穩定產能，也獲得包括輝達在內的重要客戶支持。\n\n業界普遍認為，建立具韌性的美國半導體供應鏈是一項長期工程，台積電勢必在成本與戰略之間持續權衡，但美國擴產方向短期內不會改變。\n\n更多工商時報報導台股基金夯 19檔淨值破百元欣興董座：載板樂觀到2026養地怎麼認定？ 動工合理期間出爐",

      "Content": "4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points AI hyperscalers are ramping up their spending.\nThe stock is reasonably valued compared to its big tech peers.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the top stocks to own in 2025, marking the third straight year in which Nvidia outperformed the market. That's an impressive run, and I have no reason to doubt that Nvidia will continue that streak heading into 2026.\nEven after its 38% rise in 2025, I think Nvidia is still a top buy for 2026. I've got a handful of reasons why Nvidia is still a top buy now, and investors who don't have enough exposure to the top growth stock in the market should consider them as a reason to buy more.\n1. AI spending isn't slowing down After three years of artificial intelligence spending increasing, 2026 appears to be another year of growth. All the AI hyperscalers have informed investors that they should expect higher capital expenditures in 2026 than in 2025. Several companies benefit from these higher spending amounts, and Nvidia is one of them.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms told investors during its Q3 earnings announcement that its \"capital expenditures dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025.\" In 2024, Meta spent $39 billion on capital expenditures. For 2025, it expects full-year capital expenditures to be around $70 billion to $72 billion. If Meta continues this acceleration, it's reasonable to expect its AI spending to reach $100 billion by 2026.\nWhile Meta isn't spending all of that money on Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) , a decent chunk will be heading Nvidia's way. This same story can be repeated for practically any AI company, making Nvidia a strong candidate to own in 2026.\n2. 2026 isn't going to be the last year of AI growth This won't be the last year we see strong AI growth. Data centers take a considerable amount of time to build, and many of the plans announced in 2025 won't be fully operational for several years. This means that they won't be purchasing Nvidia chips for a few years, so the AI growth trend will stretch out beyond 2026. That's why Nvidia has informed investors that it expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.\n\nWith multiple years of AI growth expected, Nvidia is a great stock to buy and hold.\n3. Nvidia isn't as expensive as you may think There is a common misconception in the market that Nvidia's stock is overvalued. However, when you factor in the growth Nvidia is expected to deliver, this argument breaks down quickly. Nvidia trades for about 25 times fiscal year 2027's (ending January 2027) earnings.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's right in line with where other big tech companies trade, yet they don't have the great long-term prospects Nvidia does.\n4. Nvidia doesn't have the capacity to meet demand The massive AI demand for advanced chips has consumed all of Nvidia's production capacity. During its earnings call for the fiscal 2026 third quarter, Nvidia informed investors that it is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. When demand outpaces supply, that allows Nvidia to maintain its high margins and also control the supply of chips. Although alternatives are starting to emerge as real competition for Nvidia, it's still at the top of the AI food chain.\n\nNvidia is working as hard as it can to increase capacity to meet demand for its products, but just because you hear about an AI hyperscaler creating its own chips doesn't mean it's completely shifting away from Nvidia's technology.\nNvidia is still the top name in AI computing, and with AI spending expected to continue rising over the next few years, Nvidia is an excellent stock to buy hand over fist.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $489,825 !*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $51,557 !*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $490,703 !*\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee the 3 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 2, 2026\nKeithen Drury has positions in Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia.

      "Content": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 7:07 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has been down over the past few months.\nIt continues to have a dominant position in AI, and it's rolling out new products to keep it.\nNvidia is facing competition from a growing number of AI tech companies.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIs Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) finally slowing down? The artificial intelligence (AI) giant ended 2025 on a high note, up 39%. However, it's down about 7% from its highs at the end of October, when it became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap .\nCan it get back there? And does it still offer value for investors from this level? Let's see where it could be a year from now.\nNew products, rising competition Nvidia plays a central role in AI development. Its product line, including its various graphics processing units (GPU) and CUDA software, are relied upon by its many high-profile clients like Amazon and Microsoft .\nAI is a fast-moving and rapidly changing industry, and Nvidia continues to roll out innovative technology and new products to provide the necessary power for its clients to process data. Data centers are one of its biggest growth drivers today, and it keeps bringing out new graphics processing units (GPU) with more processing power to handle greater data loads. It's also rolling out many vertically integrated solutions that keep clients within its ecosystem. That protects it to some degree from the onslaught of new competition in the space. As a high-growth industry, there's no shortage of companies trying to develop more sophisticated AI technology.\n\nThat brings us to where Nvidia could be in a year. Considering its dominance and innovation, I don't envision it slowing down and losing ground just yet. So while new competition could eventually put a dent in its growth, it may take a while to make a big impact. At the same time, it looks like the market is already pricing in these worries into the stock's cost. As long as the AI market continues to grow, Nvidia is likely to follow suit, albeit at a slower pace than in the past.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

PS5 prices aren't helping\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Jared Blikre\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 7:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: SNEJF\n\nSONY\n\nWedbush Securities managing director of strategic planning Michael Pachter explains to Yahoo Finance how Sony's ( SONY ) gaming console business is struggling, underlining how Playstation 5 prices have seen little reduction under inflation since its launch in November 2020.\nAlso catch Michael Pachter's analysis on the bidding wars for Warner Bros.

Yes.\n00:02 Speaker B\nYou know, they they lost their way on on movies a long, long time ago. Their their television unit's actually quite good. Um the gaming unit has gone all in on on selling more consoles. And Microsoft by kind of pulling away from the console business, um gave Sony an opening to not cut price. So, you know, here we are, uh what, five full years into the launch of the PlayStation uh 5 and prices are higher than the launch price. Now, obviously, some of that is due to Trump, but, you know, tariffs. But um you this is just unprecedented that we haven't seen console prices decline. So Sony's selling a kind of a weak number of consoles, but they think they're winning because Microsoft's selling virtually none. Um I think the console business is going away. Um it'll it'll be a niche business like 3D televisions. There'll still be people who buy them like turntables for for listening to music. There are people who will buy them. But ultimately, we're going to get everything, you know, on connected TV and Sony is just not part of that. Their acquisition strategy has been downright stupid. Uh they bought Bungie for $3.6 billion dollars. You know, and just to compare and contrast that EA bought uh Vince Zampella, the late Vince Zampella's Titanfall maker respawn for 450 million. So Sony is just ridiculously overpaying for things. Uh Bungie's produced nothing that has worked. Uh the console business is dying and they don't have a backup plan.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "With 81% ownership in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:SIMO), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 6:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nKey Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Silicon Motion Technology's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nThe top 18 shareholders own 51% of the company\nOwnership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nEvery investor in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation ( NASDAQ:SIMO ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nLast week’s 3.9% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 75% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Silicon Motion Technology, beginning with the chart below.\nView our latest analysis for Silicon Motion Technology\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Silicon Motion Technology? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Silicon Motion Technology. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Silicon Motion Technology's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Silicon Motion Technology. FMR LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 10.0% of shares outstanding. Reinhart Partners, LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 4.4% of common stock, and Acadian Asset Management LLC holds about 3.8% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Chia-Chang Kou, the CEO has 1.4% of the shares allocated to their name.\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of Silicon Motion Technology The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$100m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Silicon Motion Technology. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nNext Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

      "Content": "Tesla Stock Has Been Flat For 2 Months - How to Make a 3.2% Yield in One-Month Puts\n\nMark R. Hake, CFA\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 6:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla, Inc. ( TSLA ) stock has been flat over the last 2 months. But investors are making money by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options. For example, over the next month, Tesla put options with exercise prices 6.4% lower than today's price provide a 3.2% income yield.\nTSLA closed at $438.07 on Friday, Jan. 2, 2026. That is about where it was on Nov. 6, 2025, when it closed at $445.91. However, some investors have made money by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options (and OTM calls).\n\nMore News from Barchart The Saturday Spread: How Basketball Analytics May Help Extract Alpha (CPNG, DBX, BBY)\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nMaking Money with Out-of-the-Money Xash-Secured Put Sales For example, I discussed this in a Dec. 2, 2025, Barchart article, “ Tesla Stock Has Been Flat - Good for Shorting Puts to Make a One-Month 2.5% Yield .”\nI demonstrated how an investor could earn $1,068 on December 2, 2026, by securing $40,500 in collateral with their brokerage firm for a put that expired on January 2, 2026.\n\nThat was a cash-secured short-put play for investors, giving them an immediate 2.637% one-month yield (i.e., $10.68/$405.00). In return, the investors had an obligation to buy 100 shares with the collateral at $405.00, if TSLA stock fell by 5.6% to that price on or before Jan. 2, 2026.\nSince TSLA closed at $438.07, this obligation expired, and the investors made a clean 2.64% one-month yield. (By the way, TSLA rose from $430.46 to $438.07 over the last month, or just +1.77% - so shorting OTM puts was a better play).\nTherefore, it now makes sense to repeat this short put play.\nShorting TSLA Puts Over the Next Month For example, look at the Feb. 6, 2026, expiration TSLA put option chain. It shows that the $410 exercise price put option contract has a midpoint premium of $13.23.\nAn investor can earn an immediate yield of 3.226% (i.e., $13.23/$410.00) for an obligation to buy 100 shares at $410, i.e., 6.4% below Friday's close.\nIn other words, by securing $41,000 with their brokerage firm, the investor who enters an order to “Sell to Open” 1 put contract at $410 expiring Feb. 6, immediately collects $1,323.00 .\nMoreover, even if TSLA falls to $410 on or before Feb. 6, 2026, the investor's net cost, i.e., the breakeven (B/E) point, is below $400 per share:\n$410.00 - $13.23 income received = $396.77 B/E\nIn other words, this is a good way to set a potential lower buy-in point. That B/E is $41.30 below Friday's close at $438.07 , or a downside protection of 9.4%\n\nStory Continues\nThat seems like a good way for existing investors to make extra income, plus potentially lower their average cost in TSLA stock.\nFor new investors, it also sets a lower buy-in point but provides income while waiting.\nRisks and How to Handle Them Nevertheless, it could result in an unrealized loss if TSLA falls below $410 and the puts are assigned to buy 100 shares with the cash-secured collateral. For example, if TSLA falls to $396.00, the investor would have a net unrealized loss, as it would be below the B/E point.\nHowever, all would not be lost. Don't forget that by doing successive one-month short-put plays, the investor builds up income. For example, over the last two months, an investor would have gained $1,068 + $1,323, or $2,391, or $23.91 per put contract shorted.\n\nThat means that the net breakeven is now $410-$23.91, or $386.09. That's 11.9% below today's price.\nMoreover, even after having an assignment, the investor now owns 100 shares of TSLA. They have not sold anything. That means they could sell out-of-the-money (OTM) covered calls over the next month. This would help defray any potential unrealized loss - again without selling any TSLA shares.\nThe bottom line is that if TSLA stock stays flat over the next several months, it makes sense to take advantage of the high put option premiums.\nShorting one or two-month out-of-the-money put options provides good income and a potentially lower buy-in point.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Buy in January That Could Join Nvidia in the $1 Trillion Club by 2030\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 5:29 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nORCL\n\nV\n\nXOM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Visa and ExxonMobil are highly efficient businesses that return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nOracle is a high-risk, high-potential-reward bet on increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nNetflix deserves a premium valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Visa ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ended 2025 as the most valuable company in the world. It is one of nine S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stocks with market capitalizations exceeding $1 trillion -- the others being Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Broadcom , Tesla , and Berkshire Hathaway .\nEli Lilly , Walmart , and JPMorgan Chase only need to rise 14% or less to expand the list to 12 companies.\nHere's why Visa (NYSE: V) , ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) , and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) have what it takes to be winning investments over the next five years and join the $1 trillion club by 2030.\n1. Visa Visa's path to $1 trillion is fairly straightforward. The payment processor has high margins, a reasonable valuation , and steady earnings growth, and returns tons of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nVisa can generate high single-digit or double-digit earnings growth even during challenging periods.\nDespite slowdowns in consumer spending, Visa grew non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) earnings per share by 14% in 2025. If Visa can maintain that growth rate going forward, it could reach a market cap well beyond $1 trillion by 2030.\n\n2. ExxonMobil ExxonMobil will need to double in five years to surpass $1 trillion in market cap. It absolutely has what it takes.\nExxonMobil is generating gobs of free cash flow (FCF) and high earnings, even though oil prices are hovering around four-year lows. It has reduced its production costs and can break even at low oil prices, and has plenty of upside potential during a higher-price environment. It also has a growing low-carbon business and a massive refining and marketing segment.\n\nExxonMobil's corporate plan through 2030 forecasts double-digit earnings growth even if oil and gas prices are mediocre. Although the U.S. Energy Information Administration is only forecasting $55 per Brent crude oil barrel in 2026, oil prices could rise in the coming years due to economic demand fueled by artificial intelligence (AI), as well as overall economic growth and geopolitical tensions.\nEither way, ExxonMobil doesn't need a lot of help from oil prices to grow earnings at a solid pace. A 15% annual growth rate, compounded over five years, would double earnings. Given the stock's reasonable volatility, it could double as well, pole-vaulting ExxonMobil over the $1 trillion bar.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the meantime, ExxonMobil investors will benefit from its stable and growing 3.4% dividend, which ExxonMobil has increased for 43 consecutive years.\n3. Oracle Oracle almost surpassed $1 trillion in market cap in September before falling over 40% from that high due to concerns about its AI spending and mounting debt.\nOracle is ramping up spending to build out data center infrastructure to grow its cloud computing market share, especially for high-performance computing workflows. It exited its most recent quarter with $523 billion in remaining performance obligations, signaling demand is high for its infrastructure. But Oracle needs to convert capital expenditures into earnings. In the meantime, it is FCF negative, making Oracle a leveraged bet on increased AI adoption.\n\nDespite its risks, Oracle's potential is impossible to ignore. Oracle is a great buy for investors who agree that its aggressive AI investments are the right long-term move and are willing to endure what will likely be a highly volatile period in the stock price.\n4. Netflix Over the last six months, Netflix's market cap has slipped from over $560 billion to under $400 billion due to a mix of valuation concerns and uncertainties regarding its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) . Netflix will probably receive regulatory approval for the acquisition, but still faces challenges from Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ: PSKY) , which is attempting a hostile takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nBut with or without Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix has what it takes to steadily grow earnings through a combination of global subscriber growth and pricing power. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, it could create a highly lucrative top-tier streaming platform that features content from both Netflix and HBO, as well as a revamped ad-supported tier.\nEven without HBO, Netflix has mastered the art of aligning content spending with steady subscription revenues, thanks to its depth and breadth of content -- from building global franchises from scratch like Stranger Things , to the success of KPop Demon Hunters.\nNetflix has already demonstrated impeccable pricing power with multiple price increases in a relatively short amount of time and a crackdown on password sharing that was largely accepted by users -- even during a period when people are pulling back on discretionary spending. So even if it doesn't quite crack the $1 trillion club, I still fully expect Netflix to be a winning investment and outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years.\n\nStart the new year off right with these top stocks With the broader indexes around all-time highs, it's easy to get enamored by the companies that could surge in value in the coming months or in 2026. But a far more rewarding approach is to invest in companies that have what it takes to compound in value over the long term.\nVisa, ExxonMobil, Oracle, and Netflix certainly fit that mold. That's why I expect all four stocks to outperform the S&P 500 and join the $1 trillion club over the next five years, even though they are currently far from reaching that milestone.\n\nShould you buy stock in Visa right now? Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

So, I I wouldn't underestimate them. Traium is at full capacity and uh has a backlog and it's a stock that's trading at a peg of 1.4 times. If you go back and look at the S&P historically, it's traded at a peg of 1.5 to two times. Um so I think this company is fairly valued um and has the ability to deliver not just robust earnings growth, but free cash flow is going to increase next year to levels we haven't seen in five years.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】上周五是2026年的第一個交易日，台股大盤不負眾望，直接跨越29,000點大關，這種氣勢如虹的表現，不僅宣示多頭架構的延續，更為今年的台股行情定下了「強者恆強」的基調。統一投顧分析師陳立委新一周選入旺宏（2337）、益登（3048）、光頡（3624）、欣興（3037）、惠特（6706）。\n\n受惠台積電法說會前樂觀氛圍及產業重磅利多加持，上周五加權指數以29,016點紅盤開出，隨後買盤源源不絕，指數開高走高，盤中幾乎沒有太大回檔壓力，終場大漲386點，收在29,349點，漲幅達1.33％，再度刷新歷史新高紀錄。成交量能配合擴大至6,488億元之上，顯示這波攻勢並非虛火，而是有實質買盤進場承接。\n\n推動大盤再創高峰的動力，主要來自半導體與AI產業鏈強力利多。市場傳出中國為加速AI布局，擬在2026年向輝達採購超過200萬顆H200晶片，這項消息含金量極高。與此同時，美國向台積電核發出口許可，准許其將美國晶片製造設備出口至中國，這讓半導體設備族群吃下定心丸。\n\n全球矚目的CES消費電子展即將在1/6登場，AI PC、AI眼鏡以及各類邊緣運算應用將是展場焦點；此外，光學鏡頭龍頭大立光將於8日召開法說會，護國神山台積電則在15日接棒。市場預期在先進製程產能滿載及CoWoS擴產順利的背景下，法說會將釋出正向展望。\n\n從技術面來看，上周五這根實體大紅K棒具有指標性意義。指數目前穩穩站在所有均線之上，呈現標準的多頭排列。KD指標與RSI指標同步向上，顯示短線動能強勁；MACD紅柱體持續放大，代表多方力道正在加速集結。在技術面毫無敗象的情況下，拉回找買點仍是目前最順勢的操作邏輯。\n\n中國亦傳出開發出名為 LightGen的光子晶片，試圖在運算效能上挑戰輝達，這顯示美中科技戰將進入新一輪技術軍備競賽，長線可能對現有供應鏈版圖產生微妙變化。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一陳昱光／台北報導)",

      "Content": "Is This a Rare Buying Opportunity for Amazon Stock?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 10:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon has multiple high-growth business segments, despite low stock returns in 2025.\nThis mismatch presents a buying opportunity, especially as Amazon continues to harness artificial intelligence.\nAmazon's online ads are boosting margins while catching up to Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a reliable long-term performer, but the growth stock didn't have a spectacular 2025. The growth stock only gained 5% despite strong financial results throughout the year, and this mismatch makes Amazon look promising.\nIt has made great strides in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), four industries that are poised for long-term growth. That's enough to warrant a closer look, and when you dig into recent results, Amazon's stock seems undervalued at current levels.\nOnline ads can boost margins Amazon's margins have received a massive boost in recent years as its business diversifies beyond online retail. While Amazon Web Services has taken center stage in the company's long-term plans, investors should also consider the growth in Amazon's online advertising segment.\nThat part of the business was up by 24% year over year in Q3, reaching $17.7 billion. Although ad revenue is a little less than 10% of Amazon's total revenue, it is a high-margin business. Amazon is also competing with tech giants Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) with online ads. Meta Platforms earned $51.2 billion in Q3, while Alphabet brought in $65.9 billion from ads.\n\nAmazon's ad business is catching up to the two adtech leaders. It's still growing at a great pace despite the one-year stock gains not reflecting that.\nArtificial intelligence enables multiple tailwinds While some AI stocks are speculative, Amazon is already making money with this technology. Amazon Web Services revenue growth has accelerated and achieved a 20% year-over-year growth rate, returning to 2022 growth levels, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\nArtificial intelligence requires more cloud computing, and that has resulted in more companies turning to Amazon Web Services. Amazon's cloud platform also lets businesses build AI agents.\n\nAmazon is also using internal Trainium2 chips to power parts of its cloud platform. Trainium2 AI chips can reduce Amazon's chip costs, making it easier for the company to expand its AI presence. These same AI chips are generating strong demand and can become another valuable segment under Amazon's corporate umbrella. For instance, Trainium2 AI chips grew by 150% sequentially and are now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is also using AI to enhance its offerings, such as its online marketplace. AI lets Amazon present personalized product recommendations and display ads that are more likely to get clicks.\nThe tech giant's stock price movements over the past year do not reflect the quality of the business. Amazon's overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year in Q3, while net income rose by 38% year-over-year. Both of those rates are higher than the stock's one-year return, which may set the stage for a 2026 rally.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】2026年初，全球科技股將迎來兩個高度關鍵事件：美國拉斯維加斯的CES消費電子展，以及台積電1月法人說明會。前者代表終端需求與應用場景的最新風向，後者則是半導體供給端與資本支出循環的核心指標。在AI投資主軸仍然清晰的背景下，這兩項事件有望協助市場從短期題材修正回到基本面，並引導資金重新聚焦在具備結構性成長與出貨能見度的受惠族群。\n\n從CES展的角度來看，2026年的最大特色在於市場不再單純為「AI 能做什麼」買單，而是開始檢驗「AI是否真的能被穩定使用」。無論是智慧家居、穿戴裝置或機器人，展會訊息顯示，廠商正試圖以續航時間、即時反應與隱私保護等實際體驗，說服消費者與企業端加快採用。對投資人而言，CES的價值不在於單一明星產品，而在於平台化與生態系是否成形，以及量產與上市時程是否同步揭露。\n\n值得注意的是，本屆CES的另一條隱性主線，落在「端側AI的基礎建設」。隨著AI功能逐步下放至終端設備，對高效率電源管理、感測器融合、記憶體頻寬與高速介面的需求同步上升。這類需求雖不如終端產品吸睛，卻直接影響整體使用體驗與成本結構。若展後能看到OEM與平台商在規格與供應鏈選擇上趨於一致，將有助於相關零組件供應商取得較長期的訂單能見度，也更容易被資本市場視為「可投資的成長題材」。\n\n機器人與Physical AI仍是CES最具想像空間的板塊，但同時也是市場最謹慎看待的領域。投資焦點已從舞台展示轉向實際任務的穩健度與商業可行性，尤其是在非受控環境下的安全性與長期維護成本。若主流平台能在展期或展後釋出清楚的SDK、生態夥伴與應用案例，相關的致動器、視覺感測、邊緣運算與工業電腦供應鏈，才有機會從題材性評價，轉為基本面驅動。\n\n然而，CES所釋出的需求訊號，最終仍需上游供應鏈的產能與技術配合，這也使得台積電1月法說成為市場更關鍵的定錨點。2026年初法說會的重心，將不只是單季營運表現，而是資本支出規模、先進製程擴產節奏，以及先進封裝是否持續放量。\n\n隨著AI應用由雲端延伸至邊緣，晶片設計對能效與異質整合的依賴程度提高，台積電在2nm製程與CoWoS、SoIC等封裝技術上的布局，直接影響整條供應鏈的投資信心。\n\n市場普遍預期，2026年台積電資本支出將由2025年的400～420億美元提高至500億美元，重點放在3nm擴產、2nm量產爬坡以及先進封裝產能擴張。\n\n由於CoWoS仍是AI晶片的關鍵瓶頸，任何關於產能提升、良率改善與交期穩定的說法，都可能成為資金重新布局封裝測試與材料族群的重要催化劑。即便海外新廠與新節點初期可能壓抑短期毛利，但只要定價能力與長期毛利率目標維持不變，市場對先進製程的估值邏輯仍將站得住腳。整體而言，CES與台積電法說形成了需求端與供給端的雙重驗證。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一凱基投顧董事長朱晏民)",

      "Content": "護國神山台積電即將於1月15日召開法說會，外資研究機構Aletheia Capital釋出最新產業觀察，直指在雲端業者自研晶片加速、AMD市占擴張，以及NVIDIA AI需求持續爆發的帶動下，台積電已站上新一輪長線成長循環的起跑點，重申「買進」評等，並將合理股價上看新台幣2,400元。\n\n在基本面利多支撐下，台積電股價2日收在1,585元、再寫新高，市值同步突破41兆元；Aletheia也將台積電ADR目標價上調至500美元，較目前水準仍具逾五成上行空間。\n\n先進製程放量速度被低估 2027年為關鍵轉折年\n\nAletheia指出，市場低估了台積電未來幾年的擴張速度。報告預估，2025至2028年間，5奈米以下先進製程產能將進入高速成長期，年複合成長率（CAGR）上看30%以上。\n\n其中，2027年被視為關鍵轉折年，當年先進製程產能年增幅可能一舉放大至40%～50%。屆時，台積電將同時量產N3、N2／A16，並推進至A14世代。若計畫順利，至2028年，最先進製程占12吋晶圓總產能比重，將由2025年不到三成，躍升至2028年逾五成。\n\n兩大「超級園區」規劃曝光 全台先進製程火力全開\n\n為支撐龐大的產能需求，報告指出，台積電可能啟動兩項全新的「超級園區」計畫。首先是南科Fab18擴建案，擬在現有廠區旁新增三座晶圓廠，整體規模擴大約五成，主攻N3、N2與A16製程，預計2026年動工、2027年底裝機。\n\n其次，台積電可能在台中中科、鄰近既有Fab15的用地，規劃代號「Fab25」的新園區，初期以A14節點為主，後續延伸至A12，整體可容納4至6座先進製程廠房。\n\n既有據點方面，新竹Fab20、高雄Fab22將持續擴充N2／A16產能；海外部分，美國亞利桑那Fab21也將依計畫於2024年底至2028年間，陸續導入N4、N3與N2製程。\n\n舊廠資產活化 先進封裝成第二成長引擎\n\n除先進製程外，先進封裝被視為另一具強力引擎。Aletheia指出，台積電正將多座8吋舊廠（如Fab2、3、5、6、8）轉型為高附加價值的先進封裝基地，預計12至24個月內完成。\n\n分析指出，轉型後的單位價值可達傳統8吋晶圓的5～10倍；隨竹南、嘉義、台南等新據點陸續加入，先進封裝營收預估將由2025年的150億美元，成長至2027年約380億美元。\n\nAI營收占比逼近半數 獲利與現金流同步放大\n\n在財務面，Aletheia預估，台積電2026年營收將年增約33%至1,633億美元，2027年更有機會突破2,000億美元；每股盈餘（EPS）則可望由2024年的45.2元，跳升至2027年的120.2元。\n\n至2027年，AI相關營收占比預估將逼近40%～45%。即使資本支出同步拉高至600億美元以上，在高成長支撐下，資本支出占營收比重仍可維持在約三成的健康水準，顯示台積電在積極擴張之餘，仍具充沛現金流與長線競爭力。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導開春除息1表看》11檔月配集中「這3天」 00953B連8次填息 高股息也比不上…專家：想要高收益率選它60億科技大廠無預警關廠！股價大逃殺跌停 1.1萬張排隊搶賣新生兒年少2成 今年恐剩8萬",

      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Loaded Up on Nike Stock. Should You?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 12:38 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tim Cook bought 50,000 shares of Nike stock.\nThe Apple CEO is a director on Nike's board.\nNike recently returned to top-line growth, but there are still some major concerns.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nWhen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE) in late December, it got a lot of attention and even sent shares of the athletic apparel and shoe company sharply higher. After all, not only is Cook a successful businessman, but he is a Nike insider. The CEO sits on Nike's board of directors.\nInvestors sometimes treat insider buying as a simple signal: management (or board members) think the stock is undervalued. Sometimes that's right. But investors shouldn't follow blindly.\nSo, is Nike stock a good buy today or not? Let's take a look.\nCook's buy matters, but so does the context Notably, Cook's purchase was an open market one. This means it wasn't part of a stock option compensation plan (or a similar plan). Rather, he had to pay full price for his shares. Additionally, the purchase was sizable, totaling nearly $3 million. It also nearly doubled his stake in the company. Given the size of the purchase and the significant increase in Cook's stake, it's not surprising that the market interpreted the purchase as good news.\n\nStill, it's important to remember that Cook is a Nike director.\nThat doesn't mean the purchase is meaningless. But it does mean he may have incentives beyond pure return maximization. Directors often want to demonstrate alignment with shareholders, reinforce confidence during a rough stretch, or meet (or stay ahead of) internal ownership expectations. In other words, it can be both a sincere vote of confidence and a governance-minded move.\nA rough patch Investors should look beyond Cook's purchase to answer this simple question: Does Nike's business momentum (or lack of it) and valuation offer an attractive risk-reward right now?\nUnfortunately, I don't think so.\nNike's turnaround is making progress, but the business still looks challenged.\n\nRevenue in the company's second quarter of fiscal 2026 (a period ended on Nov. 30, 2025), rose just 1% year over year. Further, the composition of this revenue was probably even more discouraging than this anemic headline figure. Yes, wholesale revenue rose 8% year over year, but its higher-margin Nike Direct revenue fell 8%. Nike Direct is the company's direct-to-consumer channel, made up of Nike-owned stores and sales through its digital platforms. So, this channel speaks to the company's brand power with consumers, given how directly these channels are tied to its business and to consumers.\n\nStory Continues\nNike's profitability also moved in the wrong direction. Gross margin fell 300 basis points to 40.6%, and net income declined 32% to $792 million.\nSome of Nike's near-term problems are self-inflicted as it tries to reposition parts of its business and sharpen its product and brand message so that it can perform better over the long term. But Nike still has a lot of work to do.\n\n\"NIKE is in the middle innings of our comeback,\" said Nike CEO Elliott Hill in the company's latest earnings release, adding that the company is working through its \"Win Now\" strategic actions, including \"strengthening partner relationships\" and \"rebalancing our portfolio...\"\nMeanwhile, the athleisure space remains intensely competitive , as the company faces major competition from younger brands like Lululemon , Vuori, and Hoka, as well as more established brands like Adidas . Of course, Nike's brand still has enormous global equity. But consumers have more choices than ever.\nA look at valuation I'd be more willing to recommend Nike in the middle of its turnaround and an intensely competitive environment, but shares arguably don't look cheap enough. Sure, the company's dividend yield of 2.6% is solid, and Nike has an exceptional balance sheet. But with earnings moving in the wrong direction and sales barely growing, it's tough to justify the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 37.\n\nEven Nike's forward price-to-earnings is high, at 40. Measuring its price as a multiple of analysts' expected earnings per share over the next year, the fact that Nike's forward price-to-earnings ratio is higher than its trailing price-to-earnings ratio shows that analysts expect earnings to remain under pressure.\nGiven the competitive intensity in athleisure, declining sales in its direct-to-consumer channel, margin pressure, and ongoing uncertainty as far as tariffs go, I personally will be staying on the sidelines.\nCook's buy in Nike stock is interesting. But, for me, that's about all it is.\nShould you buy stock in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

And if you believe the company’s true value is $78.52, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Skyworks Solutions’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nWhat kind of growth will Skyworks Solutions generate? Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Skyworks Solutions' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? SWKS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nStory Continues\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SWKS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Skyworks Solutions , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\nIf you are no longer interested in Skyworks Solutions, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Marvell Technology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRVL) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nWith its stock down 9.0% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study Marvell Technology's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marvell Technology is:\n18% = US$2.5b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2025).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Marvell Technology\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nMarvell Technology's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE To start with, Marvell Technology's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Marvell Technology's net income shrunk at a rate of 6.6% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\nThat being said, we compared Marvell Technology's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 5.0% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MRVL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory Continues\nIs Marvell Technology Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? When we piece together Marvell Technology's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 8.4% (where it is retaining 92% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nIn addition, Marvell Technology has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 3.9% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.\nConclusion In total, it does look like Marvell Technology has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia has purchased Intel shares worth $5 billion, carrying out a transaction ‌announced in September.\nThe AI chipmaker had announced back then that it would pay $23.28 per share for Intel ⁠common stock, buying over 214.7 million Intel shares at the price set out in the agreement, as per Monday's filing. The deal forms part of a broader strategic agreement to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers.\nThe share purchase comes just a week after Reuters reported that Nvidia Corp. has halted a test to use Intel’s advanced 18A manufacturing process to make advanced chips. The AI chipmaker tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, the report said.\nInvestors had been closely watching Intel's advanced 18A as a milestone that could help the company compete more directly with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in advanced chip manufacturing. However, the halt now raises concerns about the company’s ability to regain ground in the foundry race.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures, and sells computer products and technologies, delivering data storage, computer, networking, and communications platforms.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors will be pleased with their solid 112% return over the last three years\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThe most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) share price has soared 109% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock!\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring three years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 28% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Apple will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 112% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective Apple shareholders are up 12% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 16% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Apple you should know about.\n\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Strong AI Tailwinds Lift KLAC Despite Ongoing China Export Risks\n\nVardah Gill\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:31 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC ) is included among the 20 Best Performing Dividend Stocks in 2025 .\nPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is up nearly 97% since the start of 2025. Analyst sentiment has followed that move. Jefferies upgraded the shares to Buy and lifted its price target to $1,500. Oppenheimer kept an Outperform rating and set a $1,400 target. Those calls helped reinforce momentum and pushed investor confidence higher.\n\nThe broader backdrop has also helped. SEMI expects semiconductor equipment sales to hit a record in 2025, driven largely by AI-related investment. Those macro tailwinds fueled a rally across the sector, lifting many equipment names at the same time.\nEarlier in October, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates. Management pointed to strong AI-linked demand for its chipmaking tools, while also calling out growing risks tied to its China exposure amid ongoing US–China trade tensions.\nDemand for advanced chips that support generative AI workloads has continued to climb. That trend benefits niche suppliers like KLA, whose equipment is used inside semiconductor manufacturing facilities, commonly known as fabs.\n\nTrade policy remains a clear headwind. KLA expects US export restrictions to reduce sales by $300M to $350M over the next five quarters. The company said this reflects “additional market access loss related to certain customers in China resulting from extended export controls from the U.S. government,” according to a letter to shareholders.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is based in Milpitas, California. The company designs wafer fab equipment and supplies process control and yield management systems used across the semiconductor industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Moreover, AMD will be looking to build a platform, not just offer alternatives.\nCES 2025 recap: what Nvidia and AMD showed last year That said, here’s the lowdown from last year’s event for both tech giants.\nNvidia showed off its powerful Cosmos platform for “physical AI,” positioning it as a foundation for real-world deployment.\nNvidia introduced Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs while highlighting new RTX-PC AI tooling (including NIM microservices/Blueprints).\nAMD rolled out its AI PC portfolio, covering Ryzen AI Max/Max PRO , and expanded Ryzen AI 300 chips tailored to Copilot+ PCs.\nAMD leaned into gaming/graphics with Ryzen X3D desktop chips and Ryzen Z2 handheld processors. Also, it offered previews of the Radeon RX 9070- series (RDNA 4) GPUs and FSR 4.\n\nStory Continues\nAt CES 2026, the real fight is over AI CES 2026 runs January 6 to 9 in Las Vegas , and though it has historically been more of a gadget showcase, this year it’s shaping up to be the year’s first high-stakes tech meeting.\nInvestors expect a needle-moving event, spearheaded by concrete roadmaps, partnerships, and major commitments.\nFor the biggest chipmakers, CES will be all about owning the AI conversation early . Nvidia will seek to reinforce its dominance by rallying partners with demos, keynotes, and industry-wide signaling.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood shells out $1.3 million on biotech stock\nAMD will look to rain on Nvidia’s parade.\nBy spotlighting new PC platforms and capitalizing on a larger OEM market share , AMD will aim to carve out its own lane for AI-driven growth.\nFor perspective, the AI trade has lost its luster lately, and big-name skepticism targets are growing louder.\nFront and center is the “Big Short” Michael Burry , who is openly comparing the current AI frenzy to past manias.\nBurry delivered a scathing takedown of Nvidia.\nThat’s exactly why Nvidia and AMD will be looking for a strong start to set the tone early in 2026.\nBig banks reset targets on Nvidia and AMD Nvidia and AMD both had a solid outing at the stock market last year.\nFor perspective, Nvidia stock ended 2025 up 41% , while AMD posted an 83% gain .\nNow, Wall Street is recalibrating its expectations for 2026, with investors in “show-me” mode when it comes to AI.\nBank of America : Nvidia buy, $275 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nMorgan Stanley : Nvidia overweight, $250 price target; AMD equal weight, $260 price target\nUBS : Nvidia buy, $235 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nGoldman Sachs : Nvidia buy , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $210 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nJPMorgan : Nvidia overweight , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $270 price target\nSource: Barron's\nRelated: Veteran analyst resets AI stock buy list for 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 2, 2026, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

They're hosting their own press event on January 5th. CEO Jensen Wong will take the stage. He did it last year as well. They announced a number of new products, a new chip for a smaller bitesize desktop AI computer, as well as a number of different software innovations that they've really been pushing as of late.

Shares of networking chips designer Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 4.9% in the afternoon session after positive reports highlighted strong momentum in its AI-focused custom chip business and optimistic growth projections for the year ahead.\nThe company’s AI XPU offerings experienced significant traction, which led to a 37.8% year-over-year increase in its data center segment revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. This growth was driven by its custom silicon products. Looking forward, analysts projected a “snap-back” year for Marvell, with expectations for revenue to surge by approximately 40% in fiscal 2026. This anticipated growth was fueled by both the recovery of its carrier and enterprise segments and the high-volume production of custom AI silicon, as previous inventory issues were largely resolved.\n\nIs now the time to buy Marvell Technology? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Marvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% on the news that investment firm Citi issued a positive catalyst watch for the stock ahead of the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES), contributing to a broader rally in the chip sector. Citi noted that worries about competition from two major clients were likely unfounded and viewed the stock's recent price drop as a buying opportunity. The firm anticipated Marvell would showcase wider use of its networking solutions at the conference. Adding to the positive sentiment, analysts at Benchmark clarified that Marvell had retained its role in Amazon's Trainium chip designs, easing recent investor concerns. The stock's move also came amid general strength in the semiconductor market, as other chipmakers like Micron and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index also posted gains.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,931.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

      "Content": "Is Broadcom Stock a Buy After the Dip?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:43 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Some investors are feeling skittish about the high levels of capital spending on AI.\nOne important player, Broadcom, has a big opportunity in custom chip production.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nSemiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the big winners in the recent generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom that started with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. Shares have soared by roughly 350% in three years as investors bet on its ability to capitalize on the soaring demand for advanced computing hardware.\n\nThat said, some market participants feel that the AI boom might be getting ahead of itself as companies overspend on data centers without a meaningful guarantee of future returns. This uncertainty has sent Broadcom's stock down by around 15% from its all-time high of $412.\nLet's dig deeper into the pros and cons of the stock to see if this dip is a buying opportunity or a signal for investors to stay far away.\nWhy are investors getting nervous? The stock's recent slide came after Broadcom's fourth-quarter earnings report in mid-December. On the surface, the numbers were fantastic.\nRevenue jumped 28% year over year to a record of $18 billion, driven by soaring demand for AI semiconductor revenue, which rose 74% in the period. This operating segment reflects sales of Broadcom's advanced computer hardware to AI data centers, and management expects the momentum to continue into 2026 as demand for these products continues to surge.\n\nBroadcom's bottom line is also looking great, with net income doubling to $8.5 billion. With numbers like these, it's hard to believe shares are on a two-week downtrend. However, the correction makes more sense when you look at some of the uncomfortable dynamics of the AI industry itself.\nAccording to analysts at Goldman Sachs , hyperscalers are on track to spend an eye-popping $527 billion on AI-related capital expenditures (capex) , with some of this going to hardware produced by companies like Broadcom. The problem is that the scale of the spending doesn't really match up with the profits generated by AI-related software services.\nDeutsche Bank expects ChatGPT creator OpenAI to lose $140 billion by 2029. And despite being one of the top hardware spenders (with roughly $125 billion in capex for 2025), Amazon saw its cloud computing revenue rise by a relatively modest $5.6 billion compared to the prior-year period. The fear is that eventually shareholders will start to push back on all the AI spending. After all, this is money that could be going to buybacks or dividends.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom might be better positioned than Nvidia It is fair to assume that AI-related capex spending could soon drop to reasonable levels, which could reduce the growth potential of infrastructure providers like Broadcom. That said, the company is better positioned to weather a potential fallout than the industry leader, Nvidia. To understand why, we must first look at the reasons why AI development is so expensive and generally unprofitable right now.\n\nRunning and training large language models like ChatGPT requires thousands of expensive AI accelerators (such as Nvidia's Blackwell series), which consume significant amounts of energy. Broadcom's semiconductor business actually helps solve this problem by helping its clients develop appl ication-specific integrated circui ts (ASICs). These are custom chips designed to do a specific workload, making them cheaper and easier to run than Nvidia's large, general-purpose chips.\nObviously, ASICs won't be the magic bullet that makes AI companies stop burning through money. But they are the natural first step as companies seek to reduce their reliance on expensive third-party hardware. In October, cloud giant Google selected Broadcom to build its first in-house AI processor chips. This development follows a deal with OpenAI to co-develop AI accelerators and Ethernet solutions.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy? Broadcom's ability to benefit from the transition to custom chips makes it a strong bet in the generative AI opportunity. That said, the AI boom is getting long in the tooth, and investors may want to wait until there is more clarity about the sustainability of current industry hardware spending before taking a position in such a highly exposed stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Dear AMD Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 5\n\nChris MacDonald\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:08 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nAmong the world's largest semiconductor makers, Nvidia (NVDA) remains the go-to choice for investors. And rightfully so—looking at this stock's long-term chart, investors who have stuck with this name have outperformed the market by an incredible margin in recent decades.\nOf course, it's not just a one-horse race, regardless of what the media tries to tell you. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is another top name worth considering, and one that's actually outperformed Nvidia on a year-to-date basis (YTD). Surging 77% to end 2025, AMD roughly doubled Nvidia's performance this year (the world's largest chipmaker still surged 39% higher in 2025, so not bad). Thus, there are plenty of eyeballs already on AMD as 2026 kicks off.\n\nMore News from Barchart NVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\nAfter Record Runs for Western Digital and Sandisk in 2025, Consider This 1 Data Center Storage Stock for 2026\nCrowdStrike Insiders Are Offloading CRWD Stock. Should You?\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\nAs it turns out, there's another major catalyst on the horizon investors are watching when it comes to both companies. Analysts at Wedbush have pointed out that AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, is expected to make the keynote address at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on this date, with the potential for a big announcement to come.\n\nWhy Is This Catalyst So Important for AMD? I think the key announcements for AMD for this coming year are indeed likely to come at this event. CES is the biggest show in the world when it comes to anything tied to consumer electronics and is honestly one of the key shows I've always wanted to attend, for this reason. Many CEOs are expected to make big product announcements, from technological upgrades to next-generation technology expected to be released over the course of the year.\n\nI'd expect to see a strong narrative from Lisa Su around the company's roadmap moving forward, and Wedbush analysts tend to agree. They think that some “significant” technological improvements to AMD's core Ryzen chips could be announced at this conference. Doing so may propel a range of mega-cap tech companies who are looking for reasons to buy AMD chips (at a lower price point) to do so. Especially if the output differential between these Ryzen chips and Nvidia's new Blackwell and Rubin chips isn't as wide as it appears now.\n\nStory Continues\nWe'll have to see, of course, what is ultimately announced. But any sort of meaningful improvements in AMD's core CPU chip technology could spur greater investor interest in 2026 and take this stock's recent momentum to new levels. It does appear that AMD has retained strong pricing power, reflected in the company's margins above. If these margins expand further in the coming quarters, and AMD can show a cash flow growth profile that's above Wall Street estimates, I certainly think this is a stock that could be off to the races.\n\nSo, What Does Wall Street Think? As it turns out, Wedbush is just one of 44 analysts currently covering AMD stock. With a consensus price target of $285.05 per share on AMD stock, analysts believe that this chipmaker could have roughly 33% upside from current levels.\nThat's a healthy potential gain for investors looking to add some momentum to their portfolios in 2026. Indeed, momentum-driven growth stocks have provided most of the gains in the markets over the course of the past decade and a half. Thus, for those who think this trend is likely to continue and risk-on sentiment will remain in the coming year, AMD's fundamentals do point in a very positive direction right now.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 5.3% in the morning session after investor optimism grew following favorable analyst predictions for 2026 and anticipation of new product announcements.\nThe move came as top Wall Street analysts predicted a potential 32% jump in the stock's value for 2026, building on significant gains from the previous year. This positive outlook was tied to AMD's role in the artificial intelligence sector, driven by demand for high-performance computing and data centers. Adding to the excitement were rumors that the company planned to reveal a new, faster Ryzen chip and a new generation of processors at the upcoming CES 2026 conference. AMD's stock also benefited from a broader rally in tech stocks, as fresh excitement surrounding the prospects of AI lifted the sector.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $220.34, up 2.9% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us AMD’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 30 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago when the stock gained 6.8% on the news that investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains. Technology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Companies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflects a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity. The rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented companies.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,387.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas.

Customers shift to cloud subscriptions compared with on-premise deals for Splunk, and lower revenues from prior generation products negatively impacted top-line growth. Cisco’s Security offerings primarily include Network Security, Identity and Access Management, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Response offerings.\n\nHowever, Cisco’s new and refreshed products, which comprise roughly one-third of its security portfolio, are expected to help in reviving top-line growth. Solutions like SecureAccess, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense and refreshed firewalls are driving order growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Cisco saw mid-teens growth in demand for next-gen firewalls, and roughly 3,000 customers have purchased a new product since launch.\n\nSplunk continues to gain traction with annualized recurring revenues and product remaining performance obligations growing double digits in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Cisco believes the shift to cloud subscriptions reflects greater adoption and expansion of Splunk products. The addition of Splunk has strengthened CSCO’s TIDR offerings. The company has been integrating Cisco Extended Detection and Response (XDR) with Splunk Enterprise Security to create a unified and highly effective solution that helps in preventing, detecting, and responding to sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2026 service revenues is pegged at $2.16 billion, indicating 2.6% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nCSCO Faces Tough Competition in the Security Domain Cisco is facing stiff competition from Fortinet FTNT and Okta OKTA in the security domain.\n\nFortinet's AI-powered security operations business is accelerating rapidly. The company powers more than 20 AI-driven solutions through its FortiAI technology across three main areas: FortiAI-Protect for secure AI usage, FortiAI-Assist for AI-assisted operations, and FortiAI-SecureAI for secure LLM and AI systems. With more than 500 issued and pending AI patents, Fortinet is well-positioned to capitalize on growing AI security demand. The company launched its Secure AI Data Center solution, the industry's first end-to-end framework specifically designed for AI workloads, delivering high-capacity connectivity and up to 69% lower energy consumption than alternative solutions.\n\nOkta’s offerings include Okta AI, a suite of AI-powered capabilities embedded across several products, which empowers organizations to harness AI to build better experiences and protect against cyberattacks. The company benefits from strong demand for its new products, including Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Device Access, Fine Grained Authorization, Identity Security Posture Management and Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI. The company expects revenues to see a CAGR of 16% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. Okta expects revenues between $2.906 billion and $2.908 billion for fiscal 2026, indicating year-over-year growth of 11%.\n\nStory Continues\nCSCO Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Cisco shares have appreciated 30.8% in a year, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 24.2%.\nCSCO Stock Beats Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe CSCO stock is trading at a premium, with a trailing 12-month price/book of 6.49X compared with the Zacks Computer - Networking industry’s 6.13X.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) from $385 to $485 on December 12, retaining a Buy rating on the company’s shares. According to Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), its AI semiconductor division achieved $6.5 billion in Q4, improving 76% year-over-year and 25% sequentially.\nThe company reported $21 billion in orders from Anthropic over the last two quarters, while its six-quarter AI order backlog climbed to $73 billion. Broadcom’s list of clients now includes giants like Meta, ByteDance, and Google, as well as an additional contract with OpenAI to supply $1 billion in chips by late 2026.\n\nAccording to Reuters, while Broadcom’s backlog is scheduled to ship over the next 18 months, CFO Kirsten Spears warned that margins could fall. She stated that the Q1 consolidated gross margin is likely to fall roughly 100 basis points sequentially, owing to a higher percentage of AI revenue.\nAnalysts quoted by Reuters emphasize two main risks for the company, including its excessive concentration on just five AI customers, and weaker margins on AI systems, which are likely to account for a greater share of the total revenue in coming quarters, notably in the second half of fiscal year 2026.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies various semiconductor devices and infrastructure software solutions worldwide. The company operates in two segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, Marvell Technology’s data center segment posted revenues of $1.52 billion, growing 37.8% year over year, led by strong traction in custom XPU silicon products.\n\nMarvell Technology expects its custom silicon business to roughly contribute to one-fourth of its overall data center revenues and grow at least 20% next year. The company recently unveiled 18 XPU and XPU-attach socket design wins, among which many are already in volume production.\nThese design wins include full custom XPU programs, XPU-attached silicon, electrical I/O chiplets integrated inside multi-die XPU packages and other products, contributing to a pipeline of more than 10% of a $75 billion lifetime revenue funnel. MRVL’s custom silicon strategy has evolved from a niche application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) offering into a deeply embedded, multi-year hyperscaler partnership model.\nNow, Marvell Technology develops custom ASIC designs for AI, cloud data center and OEM customers using its advanced 5nm and 3nm processes like 112G XSR serializer/de-serializer (SerDes), Long Reach SerDes, PCIe Gen 6 SerDes. These capabilities enable MRVL to stay ahead of its competitors in the custom AI silicon space.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against MRVL Broadcom AVGO is one of the leading suppliers of custom silicon solutions for data center, service provider and enterprise networking customers. Broadcom’s advanced 3.5D XDSiP packaging platform is specifically designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of custom AI XPUs.\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD is another player in the custom silicon solutions and AI accelerator space with its semi-custom SoC offerings and Instinct Accelerators that power numerous data centers. Advanced Micro Devices’ reconfigurable Alveo Adaptable Accelerator Cards are used to speed up compute-intensive applications in data centers.\n\nWhile Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices are formidable players in the custom silicon space for AI acceleration, Marvell Technology’s deep partnership with NVIDIA provides MRVL necessary support to sustain in this space.\nMRVL's Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Marvell Technology have gained 13.1% in the past six months compared with the Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s growth of 22.3%.\nMRVL 6-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Marvell Technology is trading at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 7.31X, lower than the industry’s average of 8.46X.\n\nStory Continues\nMRVL Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 81% and 26%, respectively.

      "Content": "Those who invested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) five years ago are up 89%\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nGenerally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 59% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 28%, including dividends.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.9% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 58.57.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Analog Devices will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective It's nice to see that Analog Devices shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Analog Devices has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory Continues\nOf course Analog Devices may not be the best stock to buy .

      "Content": "2 Reasons to Like QCOM (and 1 Not So Much)\n\nKayode Omotosho\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 8:04 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\nQualcomm trades at $171.30 per share and has stayed right on track with the overall market, gaining 5.5% over the last six months. At the same time, the S&P 500 has returned 9.9%.\nIs now the time to buy QCOM? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nWhy Does QCOM Stock Spark Debate? Having been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\nTwo Positive Attributes: 1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Luckily, Qualcomm’s sales grew at an impressive 15.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n2. Stellar ROIC Showcases Lucrative Growth Opportunities Growth gives us insight into a company’s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? A company’s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nQualcomm’s five-year average ROIC was 47%, placing it among the best semiconductor companies. This illustrates its management team’s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\nOne Reason to be Careful: Projected Revenue Growth Is Slim Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Qualcomm’s revenue to rise by 3%, a deceleration versus its 15.3% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nFinal Judgment Qualcomm’s merits more than compensate for its flaws, but at $171.30 per share (or 14.2× forward P/E), is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\n\nStory Continues\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions If your portfolio success hinges on just 4 stocks, your wealth is built on fragile ground.

Let’s take a look at how KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) and the rest of the semiconductor manufacturing stocks fared in Q3.\nThe semiconductor industry is driven by demand for advanced electronic products like smartphones, PCs, servers, and data storage. The need for technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G networks, and smart cars is also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. Keeping up with this dynamism requires new tools that can design, fabricate, and test chips at ever smaller sizes and more complex architectures, creating a dire need for semiconductor capital manufacturing equipment.\n\nThe 14 semiconductor manufacturing stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 3.3% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.6% below.\nLuckily, semiconductor manufacturing stocks have performed well with share prices up 11.2% on average since the latest earnings results.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) Formed by the 1997 merger of the two leading semiconductor yield management companies, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is the leading supplier of equipment used to measure and inspect semiconductor chips.\nKLA Corporation reported revenues of $3.21 billion, up 13% year on year.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】大摩日前發布報告，點名亞洲AI前十強，其中台灣包含台積電、聯發科、京元電、信驊、世芯、創意等6檔上榜，統一投顧總經理、PCB女王廖婉婷認為，6檔當中世芯股價低、成長性夠，是2026開門就可以找買點的個股；如果眼光放遠，創意、聯發科續航力強勁；而台積電則是「神主牌」，本土法人遲早會回補。\n\n大摩選的台股六強都是優質個股，如果硬要挑該如何選擇？廖婉婷在「鈔錢部署」中表示，自己會先考慮獲利成長性，如果基期夠低，2026就比較有機會。\n\n她以世芯-KY(3661)為例，2025業績呈現衰退，但因為它是AWS Trainium 3供應鏈，屬於後段ASIC供應商，因此2026的業績貢獻度會很大，光是AWS貢獻世芯營收成長就接近1倍，獲利更會有1倍以上的成長，目前本益比才20出頭，空間還蠻大。\n\n世芯前3季歸屬母公司業主淨利為41.14億元，年減10.7％，每股純益為50.89元，較去年同期58.43元衰退13%，主因是北美主要CSP客戶5奈米AI晶片在2025年畫句點，法人預估世芯2025年EPS為67.8元。\n\n廖婉婷表示，世芯大客戶AWS的Trainium 3大概會在第2季出，通常法人布局都會提前1季，因此當跨入元月1日、2026第1季剛開始的時候就可以加碼。\n\n除世芯外，2026年會打進馬斯克的xAI的創意(3443)，也是廖婉婷長期看好個股。馬斯克先前發下豪語，2027年的AI晶片需求會比全市場目前用的GPU加ASIC來得更多。\n\n大客戶因台積電產能，喜歡和台灣ASIC廠合作廖婉婷分析，如果以Robotaxi，加上他的AI機器人大軍有可能成真，果真如此，對創意2027年的業績貢獻將會很大。\n\n另外聯發科(2454)也是從消費性產品打進ASIC市場，不過它Google的TPU下一代要等到2026年下半年、甚至第4季才可能出貨，所以業績貢獻會比較慢，但市場認為，即使到2027年再下一代，聯發科還是會是供應商。\n\n對於國外的客戶偏好找台灣的IP廠商合作ASIC，廖婉婷說，原因是台廠和台積電合作緊密，大家都想拿到台積電的產能，再加上台灣的封測產業很強，因此讓國際大廠頻頻登門合作。\n\n廖婉婷評估大摩挑選的6檔中，世芯因為股價低、成長性夠強，會有很大的成長空間，被認為是首選；但如果需要續航力、把眼光放大2027年，創意和聯發科都有很大成長機會。\n\n至於台積電是「神主牌」，廖婉婷說，一定會帶領台股再創新高，台股現在本益比23、24倍，台積電本益比才20倍，對台積電而言股價太委屈。\n\n她分析，主要是先前外資放假、內資減碼，加上年底壽險銀行必須獲利了結，以及會計制度改變，以及外價金的提列得減碼，所以很多金控銀行壽險年底會減低持股，明年第1季外資、本土法人會回補台積電，台積電的本益比至少應回到22倍到24倍之上。\n\n※免責聲明：文中所提之個股、ETF內容，並非任何投資建議與參考，請審慎判斷評估風險，自負盈虧。(新聞來源：旺得富理財網 王郁惠)",

      "Content": "MoneyDJ新聞 2026-01-02 10:26:10 黃立安 發佈\n\n半導體矽智財(IP)龍頭Arm針對2026年及未來發展趨勢發布20項技術預測，Arm認為2026年將邁入智慧運算新紀元，屆時運算將具備更高的模組化特性和能源效率表現，實現雲端、實體終端及邊緣AI環境的無縫互聯。法人看好ASIC暨矽智財族群包括創意(3443)、世芯-KY(3661)、智原(3035)、巨有(8227)等營運有望迎來一波高成長，而IC設計業者如瑞昱(2379)、聯詠(3034)、天鈺(4961)等也在邊緣AI佈局下，有望帶動新的成長動能。\n\nArm指出，隨著製程微縮成本持續攀升，產業正由單片式晶片轉向模組化小晶片設計，透過將運算、記憶體與I/O等功能拆分為可重複使用的模組，晶片設計業者可彈性搭配不同製程節點，不僅有助於降低研發成本，也能加快產品導入市場的速度。\n\n產業界亦觀察到，可高度客製的小晶片模組正快速崛起，這類模組可整合通用運算核心、特定領域加速器及專用AI引擎，讓晶片團隊無需從零開始，即可打造差異化SoC產品，大幅縮短設計週期並降低創新門檻。且隨著開放標準逐步成熟，不同廠商的小晶片可望實現可靠互通，進一步擴大供應鏈選擇，形塑以互通性元件為核心的新生態系。\n\n在AI運算架構上，Arm認為，特定領域加速技術已成為效能提升關鍵，但未來競爭焦點不再只是通用CPU與加速器的簡單分工，而是朝向系統級協同設計演進。晶片將從系統層面與軟體堆疊同步最佳化，針對特定AI框架、資料型態與工作負載進行深度調校，以達成效能與能效的最優解。\n\n雲端服務商已率先實踐此一方向，包括AWS的Graviton、Google Cloud的Axion及Microsoft Azure的Cobalt，皆採用從底層即整合CPU、加速器、記憶體與互連的設計思維，打造高度客製化的平台架構。Arm認為，這將加速次世代AI資料中心落地，在有限空間內極大化AI算力，同時有效降低能耗與整體運行成本。\n\n法人指出，Arm所描繪的技術路線，對ASIC暨矽智財族群帶來中長期結構性利多。隨著客製化晶片與小晶片設計需求快速升溫，具備先進製程與系統級設計能力的ASIC業者，將在雲端服務商與大型AI客戶專案中扮演關鍵角色，包括創意、世芯-KY、智原及巨有等業者，均有望受惠於高階加速器與客製SoC專案增加，帶動營收與獲利的成長動能。\n\n在IC設計端，邊緣AI加速普及亦被視為下一波成長契機。Arm預期，AI推論任務將持續由雲端下沉至終端裝置，2026年邊緣AI將從基礎資料分析，進一步升級至即時推論與動態適配能力，並可承載更複雜模型運行。法人看好，瑞昱、聯詠、天鈺等IC設計業者，隨著AI功能導入電視、顯示器、PC、消費性與工控設備，產品單價與附加價值提升，有助於開啟新的成長曲線。",

      "Content": "The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10%\n\nSam Quirke, MarketBeat\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 11:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nKey Points Qualcomm’s MACD just flipped bearish again, and the stock is already slipping after a strong run from April.\nA similar signal in early November was followed by a fast, double-digit drop, making this setup hard to ignore.\nThe near-term “tell” is whether buyers defend the low-$170s, or whether the stock breaks down ahead of February earnings.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAfter showing many promising signs over the past quarter, shares of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) are flashing a sudden warning signal as the new year begins. Just before Christmas, the stock’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) chart logged a bearish crossover, confirming a momentum shift that has continued into this week. The mega-cap tech stock closed just below $174 on Dec. 30, still up roughly 40% since April, but also down about 15% from the late-October surge that briefly reignited bullish enthusiasm.\nSince then, however, Qualcomm has been narrowing into a tight range, and while its long-term fundamentals remain supportive, its short-term technicals are flashing caution. What makes it all the more noteworthy is that the last time this exact setup appeared, the outcome was not kind to the bulls. Could history be about to repeat itself? Let’s jump in and take a closer look.\n\n→ Hi Ho Silver Away! Silver Breaks $80 as Poor Man's Gold Explodes\nWhat Qualcomm’s Bearish MACD Crossover Signals Now The MACD is a momentum indicator that tracks the relationship between two moving averages. When the shorter-term average crosses below the longer-term one, it’s regarded as a reliable signal that upside momentum is fading and that sellers are beginning to gain the upper hand. Importantly, this is not just an intraday wobble. The crossover that appeared just before Christmas has now continued and picked up pace into this week.\n\nThat matters because MACD signals tend to be more reliable when they appear after extended rallies. Qualcomm’s run since April has been one of its most sustained in years, and so this sudden divergence could be an early warning that buyers are starting to step back, rather than to continue building positions.\n→ D-Wave vs. IonQ vs. IBM vs. Google: Which Quantum Bets Will Win 2026?\nNow, it doesn’t mean a breakdown from here is inevitable. But it does suggest that the stock is vulnerable if bulls fail to step in soon, especially given how the stock behaved the last time this happened.\nThe Last Time QCOM Flashed This Signal, Shares Dropped 10% The most recent comparison point came less than two months ago in early November. At the time, Qualcomm had also printed a bearish MACD crossover after a strong move to multi-year highs. In a move that surprised us all, what followed was a swift decline of more than 10% over the following two weeks.\n\nStory Continues\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02\nThe setup then shares several similarities with today. The stock had been moving higher into the middle of December since bottoming out from November’s correction, but in the face of increased selling pressure over the past fortnight, the bulls have been nowhere to be seen.\n\nHistory might not repeat perfectly when it comes to stocks, but it often rhymes. The point isn’t so much that Qualcomm is definitely going to fall another 10% from here; it’s that, at the very least, the stock is flashing a warning signal that is worth noting.\nWhy This Qualcomm Setup Could Play Out Differently There are also reasons not to be overly negative. Unlike early November, Qualcomm hasn’t just retreated from a multi-year high, and is actually starting to trade within a tightening range. With the longer-term uptrend still intact, it could be said to have been coiling into a pre-breakout setup over the past week, more so than starting to break down.\n\nIts fundamentals also look as strong as they have all year, with expectations building for Qualcomm to once again top the consensus in their first earnings report of 2026, due in early February. As we’ve highlighted in recent weeks, too, investor perception has been improving as the company’s diversification efforts continue to build momentum.\nEspecially when the broader equity market is in risk-on mode, this underlying narrative supports higher prices over time, even if the near-term path is choppy. That longer-term view is supported by TradeSmith’s Health Indicator, a volatility-based metric that has consistently ranked Qualcomm in the green zone for six consecutive months.\n\nWhat Bulls Must Do for Qualcomm to Start 2026 Strong Still, for Qualcomm to start 2026 on the right foot, the bulls need to reassert control soon. If the stock continues to drift lower below $172, it would significantly increase the odds of another leg down similar to November’s move.\nConversely, if buyers step in and momentum begins to turn back up, this crossover could prove to be a false alarm within a broader uptrend. Having worked hard to shake off its reputation for exasperating investors with multiple false promises, Qualcomm has earned some benefit of the doubt after its strong performance since April, but that goodwill is not unlimited.\nThe next week or two will tell a lot. A stock can coil only for so long before it has to choose a direction, one way or the other. With its fundamentals pointing higher and technicals pulling in the opposite direction, Qualcomm is approaching a moment of decision.\nThe article \" The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10% \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Goldman Sachs Downgrades Arm Holdings (ARM) Amid Limited AI Cycle Exposure and Non-Traditional Market Challenges\n\nMaham Fatima\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ARM\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2026 . On December 15, Goldman Sachs downgraded Arm Holdings to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $120, which was brought down from $160. This decision was made as the firm updated its 2026 semiconductor sector outlook and predicted that rising AI spending by hyperscalers will support digital, memory, and storage markets, while a recovery in the automotive and industrial sectors should benefit analog chips. However, Goldman Sachs downgraded Arm Holdings due to its limited exposure to the AI cycle, its ongoing business model transition, and the challenges it faces in gaining traction across non-traditional markets.\n\nIn FQ2 2026, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) achieved its best FQ2 performance to date, with total revenue reaching $1.14 billion, which was a 34% increase year-on-year. This growth was fueled by record royalty revenue of $620 million (up 21%) and a massive 56% surge in licensing revenue, which totaled $515 million. The licensing spike reflects intense global demand for next-gen AI products and Arm Holdings’ high-efficiency compute architecture. The company also delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of its previous guidance.\nStrategically, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is positioning itself as the primary solution to the power bottlenecks currently hindering data center expansion. The company’s platform is approximately 50% more energy-efficient than its competitors, a factor that has led to widespread adoption by industry giants including Nvidia, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. This efficiency drove ARM’s Neoverse royalties to more than double year-on-year. Furthermore, the company announced a strategic partnership with Meta to optimize AI efficiency and revealed plans to acquire DreamBig Semiconductor to secure critical intellectual property for data center networking and high-speed communications.\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) architects, develops, and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies for semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Revenue reached $396 million in the third quarter, up 6% sequentially, while net income climbed to $54 million, or $0.48 per share, reflecting operating leverage across its core platforms. Meanwhile, management’s guidance for a record $440 million of revenue in the fourth quarter underscores why some investors are still leaning in despite the stock’s sharp run-up.\n\nWhat also stands out is where Tower is spending. The company committed an additional $300 million to expand SiPho and SiGe capacity, targeting optical transceivers and data center demand, segments with structurally higher margins and long-duration growth drivers.\n\nAnd as for the broader context, this fund’s largest holdings skew toward higher-volatility growth names, suggesting Tower is being used as a quality compounder rather than a speculative swing.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable assets: Assets disclosed by institutional investment managers in quarterly SEC filings, covering U.S. equity holdings.\nAssets under management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or investment firm.\nTop holdings: The largest individual investments in a fund's portfolio, typically ranked by market value or portfolio weight.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nPure-play foundry: A semiconductor company that manufactures chips for other companies but does not design its own products.\nAnalog-intensive mixed-signal: Semiconductor devices combining analog and digital circuits, often used for processing real-world signals.\nSiGe: Silicon-germanium, a semiconductor material used to enhance performance in certain electronic devices.\nBiCMOS: A technology combining bipolar and CMOS transistors on a single chip for improved speed and power efficiency.\nRF CMOS: Radio frequency complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor; technology for integrating radio frequency circuits on standard CMOS chips.\nCMOS image sensors: Devices that convert light into electronic signals, widely used in cameras and imaging equipment.\nMEMS: Microelectromechanical systems; tiny mechanical devices built onto semiconductor chips for sensing or actuation.\nFabless companies: Firms that design semiconductor chips but outsource manufacturing to foundries rather than owning fabrication facilities.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is trading at an all-time high with the share price of $1,279.60 on December 26. This comes after impressive 100.59% year-to-date gains.\nWall Street is bullish ahead of the company’s fiscal Q2 2026 earnings, expected to be released on January 28. Analysts expect the company to post around $3.25 billion in revenue along with a GAAP EPS of $8.49. Recently, on December 19, Deutsche Bank reiterated a Hold rating on the stock without disclosing any price targets. Earlier, on December 16, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $1,400 to $1,450.\nArya of BofA noted that the US semiconductor stocks are attractively positioned for 2026. He sees 2026 as the halfway point of an 8-10 year-long cycle. Arya sees 2026 to be the year of faster IT upgradation, AI utilization, and AI workloads. He cautioned the investors regarding slight choppiness due to increased investor scrutiny on AI return on investment; however, this is expected to be offset by fast AI LLM builders and AI factories.\n\nThat said, on December 15, Blayne Curtis from Jefferies upgraded KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) from Market Perform to Outperform with a $1,500 price target. The analyst believes that the company enjoys a significant edge on a stronger leading edge/packaging outlook. The firm also has a constructive outlook on the wafer fab equipment growth in 2026 and 2027.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced process control equipment and services for the semiconductor and electronics industries, helping chipmakers find tiny defects, improve yields, and enhance quality in making logic chips, memory (like DRAM/NAND), LEDs, and more, essentially providing the high-tech tools to ensure flawless microchip production.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop Upgrades:\n\nKeefe Bruyette upgraded TeraWulf (WULF) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $24, up from $9.50. The firm believes investors are underestimating the magnitude of TeraWulf's bitcoin mining to high performance compute leasing mix shift in 2026 and 2027.\nClear Street upgraded Plug Power (PLUG) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $3, down from $3.50. The firm sees more attractive upside in the shares following the recent selloff. It cites dilution from Plug Power's convertible refinancing in late November for the target drop.\n\nTop Downgrades:\n\nWedbush downgraded GlobalFoundries (GFS) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $40, down from $42. While the firm believes that GlobalFoundries has a path to a model with stronger revenues, improved utilization, and better margins on improved end market fundamentals and a shift towards local supply chains, it also believes recent developments have elongated the timeframe around when those catalysts might play out, the firm tells investors.\nWedbush downgraded Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) to Neutral from Outperform with a $125 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade, noting that the stock is approaching the firm's target price and the 25-times multiple it uses to value Tower Semiconductor ostensibly already assumes some upside vs. its current estimates.\nTruist downgraded DigitalBridge (DBRG) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $16 following the announced all-cash acquisition by SoftBank Group (SFTBY) at $16 per share. The firm sees a low probability of a competing bid emerging.\nRaymond James double downgraded OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) to Market Perform from Strong Buy without a price target following the company's announcement to acquire Flushing Financial (FFIC) . The firm expects \"significant\" dilution and says the deal slows the benefit of OceanFirst's shift to a stronger core deposit franchise.\nRaymond James downgraded Flushing Financial (FFIC) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company agreed to be acquired by OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) . The deal was done at a fair price given the earnings challenges Flushing has faced due to the challenging rate environment for the past several years, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop Initiations:\n\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Serve Robotics (SERV) with a Buy rating and $16 price target. The firm believes Serve is positioned for \"strong growth and eventual profitability.\"\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of International Bancshares (IBOC) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. While the bank has elevated commercial real estate concentration, interest-rate sensitivity, and exposure to cross-border activity, the firm sees these factors being balanced by strong profitability supported by \"best-in-class\" efficiency and conservative balance sheet positioning.\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Butterfly Network (BFLY) with a Buy rating and $5 price target. The firm sees continued revenue expansion for Butterfly, driven by iQ3 probe and enterprise software adoption.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Analog Devices (ADI): Read This Before Placing a Bet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADI Check price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Analog Devices, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ADI Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $9.79.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices.

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Silicon Motion falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Silicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share, indicating a change of +44% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 points to a change of +3.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.88 indicates a change of +37.5% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nStory continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $260.55 million indicates a year-over-year change of +36.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $863.29 million and $1.05 billion estimates indicate +7.4% and +21.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $242 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.07 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.52%. The EPS surprise was +23.46%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "KLA (KLAC) Suffers a Larger Drop Than the General Market: Key Insights\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nKLA (KLAC) ended the recent trading session at $1,243.65, demonstrating a -1.33% change from the preceding day's closing price. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.14%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.24%.\nThe maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors's stock has climbed by 8.92% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.94%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of KLA in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $8.75, up 6.71% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $3.24 billion, indicating a 5.39% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nKLAC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $35.44 per share and revenue of $13.04 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.49% and +7.31%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for KLA. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.1% upward. KLA is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\nIn the context of valuation, KLA is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 35.57. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.48, so one might conclude that KLA is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that KLAC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.36. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Miscellaneous Products was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.9 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 79, this industry ranks in the top 32% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "PLTR vs. ARM: Which AI-Tech Stock is the Better Buy Now?\n\nShuvra Shankar Dey\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nARM\n\nPalantir Technologies PLTR and Arm Holdings ARM are both deeply aligned with the same powerful theme: the accelerating global adoption of artificial intelligence. Each plays a foundational role in enabling AI at scale.\nPalantir supports AI deployment through sophisticated data integration, analytics and decision-making platforms that help organizations operationalize complex data. ARM underpins AI progress at the hardware level by licensing energy-efficient processor architectures that power AI workloads across mobile devices, cloud infrastructure and data centers. While their offerings differ, both companies occupy critical points in the AI value chain, directly benefiting from the rising demand for intelligent, scalable computing solutions from enterprises, governments and consumers.\n\nThe Case for PLTR Palantir has strategically positioned itself to capitalize on the changing dynamics of the AI economy.\nAt the core of Palantir’s strategy is its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which enables businesses to structure and organize their data, whether financial, supply chain, operational or HR-related, so that AI can process and execute tasks more effectively. By leveraging an ontology-driven approach, Palantir creates digital representations of entire enterprises, allowing AI to interact seamlessly with business operations. Unlike companies that contribute to the oversupply of AI models, Palantir is actively shaping the demand side of the AI economy, positioning itself as a key player in the adoption of enterprise AI.\n\nPalantir’s financial health further reinforces its investment appeal. As of Sept. 30, 2025, the company held $6.4 billion in cash and equivalents, with zero debt, providing ample liquidity to invest in growth initiatives.\nMoreover, Palantir’s recent financial performance underscores its strength. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues surged 63% year over year, with U.S. revenues increasing 77% year over year and U.S. commercial business experiencing 121% growth. The company closed 204 deals of at least $1 million, 91 deals of at least $5 million and 53 deals of at least $10 million in the quarter.\nThe company achieved its highest-ever adjusted operating margin of 51%, reflecting the scalability of its software business model and disciplined cost control. GAAP operating income reached $393 million, while GAAP net income came in at $476 million, translating to GAAP EPS of 18 cents and adjusted EPS of 21 cents, which increased 110% year over year.\n\nThe Case for ARM Arm Holdings’ foundational advantage in power-efficient chip architecture continues to anchor its dominance in mobile computing, but its influence extends far beyond smartphones and tablets. Long known for enabling energy-saving designs for Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Samsung, Arm is becoming increasingly central as these companies accelerate their focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nStory Continues\nARM’s unique ability to deliver high performance with minimal power makes its architecture ideal for an era where intelligence is embedded everywhere, from wearables to edge devices and cloud infrastructure. AI models are being deployed across a wide array of consumer and enterprise products, and Arm’s flexible, power-thrifty designs are being adopted to support these new workloads. Apple continues to rely on ARM-based architecture for its M-series chips as it deepens AI integration across its devices. Qualcomm is using ARM designs to drive AI-enhanced smartphones and automotive platforms, while Samsung leverages ARM’s technology across mobile, consumer electronics and its expanding Exynos portfolio targeting AI and IoT applications.\n\nThe reliance of these major tech players on Arm Holdings is not only consistent but also strengthening. As Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung scale their AI ambitions and broaden their IoT ecosystems, they depend even more on ARM’s ability to deliver power-efficient performance at global scale. The company’s ongoing push to optimize its architecture for machine learning and edge computing ensures tight alignment with the emerging needs of its top customers.\nAs a result, Arm Holdings is evolving from a mobile-centric enabler to a critical AI and IoT infrastructure layer for the world’s leading device makers, solidifying its strategic importance across the broader technology landscape.\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for PLTR & ARM? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR’s 2025 sales and EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 54% and 78%, respectively. EPS estimates have been trending upward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARM’s fiscal 2026 sales and EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 21.5% and 5.5%, respectively. EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nARM’s Valuation More Attractive Than PLTR While ARM appears attractively valued with a forward 12-month P/E of 52.93X versus its median of 121.35X, suggesting that the stock could be undervalued relative to its historical range, PLTR is trading at a forward 12-month P/E of 177.24X, below its 12-month median of 308.7X.\nPLTR Seems a Choice In the current AI-driven market environment, Palantir stands out as the more compelling choice. While both companies benefit from long-term AI adoption, Palantir is more directly tied to real-world AI execution and enterprise decision-making. Its platforms are already embedded in mission-critical operations across commercial and government sectors, creating durable demand and high switching costs. Palantir’s focus on operational AI positions it on the front lines of adoption rather than infrastructure dependency. With stronger momentum, clearer AI monetization and a Buy rating compared with Arm’s Hold stance, Palantir offers greater upside for investors seeking exposure to AI as a transformative business force rather than a supporting technology layer.\n\nWhile PLTR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), ARM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in KLA Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\nFor most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in KLA (KLAC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to KLAC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nKLA's Business In-Depth With that in mind, let's take a look at KLA's main business drivers.\nSan Jose, CA-based KLA Corporation is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of process diagnostics and control (PDC) equipment and yield management solutions required for the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) or chips. The company has a comprehensive portfolio of products addressing each major PDC subsegment&mdash;photomask (reticle) inspection, wafer inspection/defect review and metrology.\n\nReticle production is vital to the semiconductor device formation process. Reticles are used to control the precise deposition of materials onto the wafer, which ultimately change its chemical characteristics, imparting specific functionalities to the ICs thus created. Inspection and metrology tools measure the quality of the reticles, helping to improve reticle production yields. As a result of the broader applicability of semiconductors, shrinking form factors and increasing functionalities of individual chips, reticle design and production are growing in importance. Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor were the largest customers in the last three years, accounting for more than 10% of total sales in each year.\n\nKLA reported revenues of $12.16 billion in fiscal 2025. Product revenues accounted for 78% while the rest came from Service segment.\n\nKLA&rsquo;s two main product lines are defect inspection and metrology. The company&rsquo;s defect inspection tools have very broad application in chip, wafer, reticle, storage, compound semiconductor and MEMS manufacturing. Metrology tools are used to gather critical dimension measurements of the wafer and process dimensions such as film thickness, lithography overlay and surface profiling. The company&rsquo;s metrology products are used in chip, wafer, reticle and solar device manufacturing. KLA also offers other products and services.\n\nIn addition to new tools, KLA also offers a comprehensive portfolio of refurbished tools that upgrade and improve yields of existing equipment under the KT-Certified program. Refurbished tools are currently sold to IC, reticle, substrate, MEMS and data storage manufacturers.\n\nAlthough KLA is a major player in each of its served markets, it faces competition from other large equipment suppliers such as Applied Materials and Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation.\n\nStory Continues\nBottom Line While anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in KLA ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in December 2015 would be worth $18,031.33, or a 1,703.13% gain, as of December 30, 2025, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 232.27% and the price of gold increased 293.02% over the same time frame in comparison.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for KLAC.\nKLA's fiscal first-quarter revenues and earnings increased year over year. The uptick can be attributed to strong demand in leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging, which drove growth in the semiconductor industry. Advanced packaging is expected to exceed $925 million in 2025. The company's robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. The services business also performed well, contributing significantly to revenue growth. KLA is well-positioned to capitalize on AI advancements, with AI driving demand for higher-value wafer processing and more complex designs. However, extended U.S. export controls on China impacted revenues in the reported quarter. Tariff-related uncertainties also impacted the company's performance.\nThe stock is up 8.92% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2025. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The company is benefiting from strong growth in its Services revenues. The company now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The new iPhone 17 series is expected to drive top-line growth. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy.\n\nApple expects the December quarter&rsquo;s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) net sales to grow between 10% and 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company expects iPhone sales to grow in double digits year over year. The Mac segment is expected to face a tough year-over-year comparison, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate.\n\nHowever, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> )\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past six months (+14% vs. +13.6%). The company&rsquo;s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk's acquisition enhances the company&rsquo;s recurring revenue base.\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco&rsquo;s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco&rsquo;s security portfolio.\n\nNetworking sales benefited from strong demand for AI infrastructure and campus networking solutions.

The company is betting big on the Watsonx platform, which is likely to be its core technology platform for AI capabilities. The company&rsquo;s focus on quantum technology for solutions to complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing is a tailwind.\n\nIBM is benefiting from a surge in demand for heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has led to sustainable growth through advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nHowever, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Macroeconomic headwinds are worrisome. IBM&rsquo;s acquisition spree has also escalated integration risks, while its high debt level is burdensome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> )\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

GAP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop 5 High-Yield S&P 500 Stock to Buy for 2026\nThe U.S. stock market has experienced significant volatility at the beginning of 2025 owing to a multitude of factors. The trade policy framework undertaken in the new Trump administration has reshaped market sentiment. The aggressive tariff measures imposed by Washington on its major trading partners have left several businesses in a state of uncertainty. The growing Sino-U.S. trade tension was a concerning factor for investors. The U.S. government aims to limit Beijing&rsquo;s access to high-end technologies. It has imposed restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor tech to China.\nThe tariff-related uncertainties have significantly affected companies with a strong presence in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Moreover, the war in Europe and the Middle East has further aggravated the market uncertainty. These developments have led to rising manufacturing costs and supply chain issues, putting pressure on margins. However, there were some positive macroeconomic developments as well in 2025. The federal reserve rate cuts have lowered borrowing costs and improved corporate profitability.\n\nTrade-related risks and changes in monetary policy led to frequent stock price fluctuations. However, broader market momentum remained positive with tech stocks largely leading the bull run. Growing spending on AI infrastructure and digital transformation is driving growth in the tech sector. Despite a hike in energy prices, the overall annual inflation rate was lower than expected in 2025.\nKey Growth Drivers for 2026\nRapid AI buildouts are expected to be a key driver for businesses in 2026. Businesses in several industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, social ecommerce, telecom and others are rapidly incorporating AI across the portfolio to gain a competitive edge. However, this rapid AI build-out requires substantial computing infrastructure, data centers to support these AI workloads, as well as energy optimization and cooling technologies.\n\nStory Continues\nAI integration has become capex-heavy. There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.\n\nChina is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government&rsquo;s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.\nAmid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.\n\nKey Picks\nInternational Business Machines Corp. : Headquartered in Armonk, NY, IBM is a leading provider of cloud and data platforms.

      "Content": "CRDO vs. MRVL: Which Data Center Connectivity Stock Is Smarter Pick?\n\nVaishali Doshi\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRDO\n\nMRVL\n\nCredo Technology Group Holding Ltd . ( CRDO ) and Marvell Technology, Inc . ( MRVL ) are semiconductor companies that specialize in high-speed connectivity solutions that are essential for AI-driven data centers.\nAmid rapid artificial intelligence (AI) proliferation, investors are focusing on companies that offer the infrastructure behind it. Semiconductor companies are at the core of AI workloads as these offer solutions to enable augmented processing power and efficiency. CRDO and Marvell are key players in this domain and bring to the table unique strengths. This makes it an intriguing comparison for investors.\n\nNow the question arises: which stock makes a better investment pick at present? Let us dive into the fundamentals, valuations, growth outlook and risks for each company.\nThe Case for CRDO Credo’s leadership in the AEC space is one of its biggest catalysts. AEC business remains its fastest-growing segment. CRDO noted that AECs, now scaling to 100-gig per lane and transitioning to 200-gig per lane architectures, have become the “de facto” standard for inter-rack connectivity. These are now replacing optical rack-to-rack connections of up to 7 meters. The increasing adoption of zero-flap AECs is mainly due to these cables offering up to 1,000 times more reliability with 50% lower power consumption than optical solutions, added CRDO.\n\nBeyond AECs, Credo’s IC portfolio, which includes retimers and optical DSPs, continued to show a healthy performance. Credo’s PCIe retimer program remains on track for design wins in fiscal 2026 and revenue contributions in the next fiscal year.\nOne of the most important recent developments for Credo is its introduction of three growth pillars, each representing a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. These include Zero-Flap (“ZF”) optics, active LED cables (ALCs) and OmniConnect gearboxes (Weaver).\nZF optics is a laser-based connectivity solution delivering AEC-level reliability through a custom optical DSP tightly integrated with Credo’s software stack. The optics are already in live data-center trials, with sampling to a second U.S. hyperscaler expected later in fiscal 2026. ALCs utilize micro-LEDs, delivering AEC-level reliability and power efficiency, and support up to 30-meter connections for row-scale data center networks. Sampling is planned for fiscal 2027, with revenues in fiscal 2028. Credo expects the ALC market to grow to more than twice the size of the AEC market. OmniConnect gearboxes are designed to optimize XDU connectivity.\nCredo now has five main high-growth pillars — AECs, IC solutions (retimers and optical DSPs), Zero-Flap optics, ALCs and OmniConnect gearboxes. Collectively, these present a total market opportunity likely to surpass $10 billion, more than tripling Credo’s market reach just 18 months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Case for MRVL Marvell is a semiconductor company with a diversified product portfolio that includes custom ASICs, data center switches and 5G chips. The company’s strategic pivot to prioritize the data center market is proving to be a successful growth catalyst. The data center end market emerged as the company's largest segment, with revenue contribution of 73% in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. The company's custom XPU silicon, electro-optic interconnect products and next-generation switch offerings are the primary drivers of its strong data center performance.\n\nInterconnect business remains impressive. The increasing demand for AECs and retimers, driven by the shift to high-speed PAM-based solutions, is likely to drive revenues from this segment moving forward. It has been working with the cable ecosystem to enable 100 and 200 gig per lane AECs and is likely to begin significant product ramps. It also noted that PCIe Gen6 retimers are also witnessing “broad traction.”\nThe data center switching business remains another catalyst with revenues expected to exceed $300 million in fiscal 2026 and top $500 million in fiscal 2027. Drivers include sustained demand for 12.8T platforms and accelerating ramps of next-generation 51.2T switches. Meanwhile, development is underway for 100T architectures, which are set to be introduced next year.\n\nThe company has been divesting non-core assets (like the Automotive Ethernet business) while layering in acquisitions, such as Avera, Aquantia , Inphi and Innovium , and now Celestial AI (expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027). Celestial AI specializes in the Photonic Fabric technology platform. This platform is purpose-built for scale-up optical interconnect. Management highlighted that Celestial AI is “deeply engaged” with several hyperscalers and ecosystem partners. Celestial AI has already won a major contract with one of the biggest hyperscalers. This hyperscaler intends to use the photonic fabric chiplets in its next-generation scale-up architecture.\nStrong cash flow and subsequent buybacks enhance Marvell’s appeal. Marvell has returned $1.35 billion through buybacks (including ASR) and dividends in the fiscal third quarter, highlighting financial flexibility even while investing.\n\nPrice Performances & Valuations of CRDO & MRVL In the past month, CRDO and MRVL have declined 15.3% and 5.2%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price/sales ratio, Credo is trading at 17.53X, higher than Marvell’s 7.44X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO? Analysts have revised earnings estimates 30% upward for CRDO for the current fiscal year in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThere is a marginal upward revision for MRVL’s bottom line\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCRDO or MRVL: Which Is a Better Pick? Credo and Marvell are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI-driven data center market.\nCRDO currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Marvell carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Is Marvell (MRVL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Marvell Technology (MRVL).\n\nMarvell currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 24 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 5.6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MRVL Check price target & stock forecast for Marvell here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Marvell, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in MRVL? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marvell, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.1% over the past month to $2.84.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marvell.

      "Content": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Is Using Debt Safely\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nDavid Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhen Is Debt A Problem? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Analog Devices Carry? The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at November 2025 Analog Devices had debt of US$8.60b, up from US$7.62b in one year. However, it also had US$3.65b in cash, and so its net debt is US$4.95b.\nHow Strong Is Analog Devices' Balance Sheet? According to the last reported balance sheet, Analog Devices had liabilities of US$3.25b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$10.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.65b in cash and US$1.44b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$9.09b.\n\nOf course, Analog Devices has a titanic market capitalization of US$135.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nStory Continues\nAnalog Devices's net debt is only 0.99 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 14.1 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, Analog Devices grew its EBIT by 45% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Analog Devices can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Analog Devices actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.\nOur View The good news is that Analog Devices's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. It looks Analog Devices has no trouble standing on its own two feet, and it has no reason to fear its lenders. For investing nerds like us its balance sheet is almost charming. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Analog Devices you should know about.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

      "Content": "【時報記者王逸芯台北報導】智原（3035）旗下小金雞、32位元微控制器（MCU）設計廠雅特力-KY（6907）預計於明年1月在櫃買中心掛牌。智原董事長、同時也是雅特力-KY董事長王國雍今日表示，目前公司營運表現相當不錯，雅特力持續深耕主流MCU應用，並從中尋找可發揮的利基市場，包括機器人、無人機以及電競等新興應用，看好今年營收可望再優於去年，對明年展望亦抱持正向態度。\n\n王國雍指出，MCU本身是一項可銷售十年以上的產品，但實際上單一客戶的使用週期可能僅兩至三年，在工控等應用中則可能拉長至十年不等，因此公司在營運評估上，會更著重整體底站與出貨結構。目前公司整體狀況良好，去年營收年增達60%，在整體MCU市場仍承壓之際，已率先繳出明顯成長成績；今年營收預期將再優於去年，且底站動能仍接近歷史高點水準，為明年營運奠定穩定基礎。\n\n王國雍進一步表示，第四季多項晶片幾乎銷售一空，目前正積極推動晶圓代工產能加量，主因新應用放量速度快，例如無人機等需求持續拉升，部分客戶甚至出現供貨吃緊的情況。從庫存面來看，無論是代理商、經銷商或終端客戶端，整體庫存水位皆偏低，也成為支撐明年營運的重要正向指標。\n\n雅特力-KY亦積極布局車用及特殊MCU應用領域。副總經理黃呈俊指出，車用市場的應用範圍相當廣泛，目前公司產品已通過AEC-Q100認證，車用應用本身也具備多個層次，公司現階段著力較多的是車載、耐用度要求較高、且具備實際出貨量的應用領域，整體車用相關營收占比約在一成多。至於AI與機器人應用，公司認為目前仍處於產業初期，但更看重其中長期成長潛力。\n\n針對MCU市場競爭態勢，王國雍表示，若晶片功能單純，確實難以做出差異化，這也是8位元市場高度內捲的主因；但在32位元MCU領域，公司採取全產品公規策略，涵蓋多元應用，即使導入車規相關設計，也不僅限於汽車市場，而是透過高規格品質驗證，提升其他高可靠度應用客戶的信任感。\n\n黃呈俊補充，所謂「內捲」在任何產業競爭中其實都是長期存在的現象，但MCU所屬產業結構相對特殊，具備少量多樣、客群分散、屬於長期且穩定的常態性市場特性，並非典型的「贏者全拿」型產業；相較外商競爭對手，公司在價格策略上更具彈性，能提供具吸引力的報價，但產品效能並不遜色。若與大陸廠商相比，公司則在產品品質與可靠度上更具優勢，這與台灣半導體產業長期累積的技術基礎與製造經驗密不可分。實務上，一項產品動輒數千美元，客戶不會因為幾毛美元的價差輕易更換供應商，因為整體系統導入涉及龐大的工程成本與時間投入，最終仍高度仰賴品牌信任與長期穩定性；也因此，即便市場競爭激烈、價格壓力升高，公司仍能在內捲環境中以產品、品質與服務正面競爭，維持長期競爭力。\n\n營收占比上，雅特力-KY 目前大陸市場營收占比約落在八成至九成之間，部分時間點甚至接近九成，不過整體結構也正逐步出現變化，這與地緣政治因素及產業供需循環有一定關聯。從國際競爭來看，主要對手為ST（意法半導體），其在疫情初期因大缺貨，與多家客戶簽訂長期供貨合約，隨著這幾年市場逐步去化，部分韓國等海外客戶的長約已陸續到期，公司在海外市場，包括韓國、台灣及亞太地區品牌的設計導入與用量明顯回升，像電競領域已成功打入全球最大電競品牌廠。整體來看，台灣與海外營收占比已由過去約一成出頭，逐步往11%、12%以上提升，但由於大陸市場營收同步成長，兩者在比例上仍呈現拉鋸狀態，目前台灣加海外合計約占十多個百分點。",

      "Content": "AI Infrastructure Demand Keeps KLA (KLAC) and Semiconductor Sector on Top for 2026\n\nMaham Fatima\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:46 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\n^GSPC\n\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC ) is one of the best performing S&P 500 stocks in 2025 . On December 16, Bank of America raised the firm’s price target on KLA Corporation to $1,450 from $1,400, while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. BofA is adjusting its price targets across the US semiconductor sector and suggests that 2026 marks the halfway point of a decade-long transition toward upgrading traditional IT infrastructure for AI-driven workloads. Stock volatility may persist as investors scrutinize AI returns and hyperscaler spending, but the firm believes that this pressure will be balanced by the expansion of AI factories and LLM developers.\n\nOn the same day, Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded KLA Corporation to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $1,500, up from $1,350. After beating the S&P 500 by 30 points in 2025, the SOX is expected to remain a market leader through 2026. Cantor Fitzgerald believes that the scale of AI infrastructure spending outweighs any short-term cyclical concerns.\nEarlier on December 15, Jefferies upgraded the company to Buy from Hold with a price target of $1,500, up from $1,100. The firm cited KLA Corporation’s dominant position in leading-edge manufacturing as AI scales and believes that the current buildout will catalyze demand for advanced chips, memory, and packaging technologies. With the stock’s valuation recently resetting to more attractive levels, Jefferies sees KLA Corporation as a primary beneficiary of the accelerating investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and markets process control, process-enabling, and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries worldwide.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Silicon Motion (SIMO) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 26, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) closed the most recent trading day at $90.23, moving +1.29% from the previous trading session. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.03% loss on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.04%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.09%.\nThe stock of chip company has risen by 1.71% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.66% and undershooting the S&P 500's gain of 2.57%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Silicon Motion in its upcoming release. On that day, Silicon Motion is projected to report earnings of $1.31 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 43.96%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $260.55 million, up 36.3% from the year-ago period.\nSIMO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.55 per share and revenue of $863.29 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +3.5% and +7.43%, respectively.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Silicon Motion. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Currently, Silicon Motion is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note Silicon Motion's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 25.09. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 25.22 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that SIMO currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.19. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.11.\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 20, finds itself in the top 9% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Bitcoin mining in 2025: IREN claims the crown as Bitdeer's stock trails the pack\n\nJames Van Straten\nDecember 26, 2025 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIREN\n\nBTDR\n\nHUT\n\n^GSPC\n\nAs 2025 draws to a close, bitcoin (BTC) faced a tough year, down about 7% year-to-date, while gold, the S&P 500 and technology stocks continue to hit all-time highs.\nAs a result, public bitcoin mining stocks have shown stark contrasts, driven largely by diversification into artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. The standout performers have been companies aggressively pivoting to AI.\n\nIREN (IREN) led with a massive +300% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled by major GPU cloud deals and Microsoft&#x27;s backing .\nCipher Mining (CIFR) followed strongly at +230%, expanding AI hosting partnerships specifically with Fluidstack .\nHut 8 (HUT) also soared, up around +139%, capped by its recent AI announcement : a $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease for 245 MW at its River Bend site in Louisiana.\nIn contrast, three of the four largest bitcoin holders among public miners underperformed the AI/HPC miners.\nMarathon Digital (MARA), the top BTC hodler among miners with 53,250 BTC, dropped -44% YTD. CleanSpark (CLSK) (13,011 BTC) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) (19,324 BTC) saw modest gains of 16% and 32% respectively, without aggressive AI diversification until much later in the year.\n\nCore Scientific (CORZ) stayed independent after shareholders rejected a $9 billion all-stock takeover bid from CoreWeave in October, betting on higher standalone value amid AI demand. Its shares are up just 9% year-to-date.\nBitdeer Technologies (BTDR), the biggest underperforming mining company in the sector, is down around 50%. The bulk of the losses came after its Q3 earnings announcement, when the company reported a larger-than-anticipated net loss and disclosed a delay to its ASIC chip, adding uncertainty around its AI expansion plans.\nThis year underscored a clear trend: miners repurposing sites for AI data centers which outperformed pure-play bitcoin operators.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAnalog Devices, Inc. ADI, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Fortive Corp. FTV.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Buy 3 Tech Stocks as Santa Claus Rally Gets Underway The Santa Claus rally appears to have finally taken off, with tech stocks rebounding after a roller-coaster ride over the past month. Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. , Amazon.com, Inc. and Fortive Corp. , which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks with Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc.

      "Content": "Returns At Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) Are On The Way Up\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 26, 2025 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nIf you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Tower Semiconductor ( NASDAQ:TSEM ) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Tower Semiconductor, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.057 = US$170m ÷ (US$3.3b - US$269m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025) .\nSo, Tower Semiconductor has an ROCE of 5.7%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Semiconductor industry average of 8.9%.\nView our latest analysis for Tower Semiconductor\nIn the above chart we have measured Tower Semiconductor's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Tower Semiconductor .\nHow Are Returns Trending? We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 5.7%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 73%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\n\nThe Bottom Line A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Tower Semiconductor has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 374% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Tower Semiconductor looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The intrinsic value infographic for TSEM helps visualize whether it is currently trading for a fair price.\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "NXP Semiconductors' (NASDAQ:NXPI) investors will be pleased with their favorable 54% return over the last three years\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 23, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nInvestors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the NXP Semiconductors N.V. ( NASDAQ:NXPI ) share price return of 45% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 6.9% in the last year.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nOver the last three years, NXP Semiconductors failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 6.8% (annualized).\nThus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.\n\nThe modest 1.8% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. You can only imagine how long term shareholders feel about the declining revenue trend (slipping at 2.8% per year). What's clear is that historic earnings and revenue aren't matching up with the share price action, very well. So you might have to dig deeper to get a grasp of the situation\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nNXP Semiconductors is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates .\nWhat About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of NXP Semiconductors, it has a TSR of 54% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory Continues\nA Different Perspective NXP Semiconductors provided a TSR of 8.9% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 10% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - NXP Semiconductors has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

This has raised fresh questions about what the market is pricing in.\nSee our latest analysis for Arm Holdings.\nOver the past year, Arm’s share price return has cooled despite strong fundamentals.

      "Content": "SVP Sells 4,945 Skyworks Solutions Shares Worth $308,000\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nDecember 22, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nKey Points The sale represented about 20% of Robert John Terry's holdings.\nTerry made three open-market sales over the past year.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nOn November 19, 2025, Robert John Terry, SVP, Gen. Counsel & Secretary of Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) , reported the sale of 4,945 shares in multiple open-market transactions, as disclosed in a SEC Form 4 filing .\n\nTransaction summary Metric\nValue\nShares sold\n4,945\nTransaction value\n~$308,000\nPost-transaction shares\n19,824\nPost-transaction value (direct ownership)\n~$1.2 million\n\nTransaction value based on SEC Form 4 weighted average purchase price ($62.28); post-transaction value based on Nov. 19, 2025 market close ($62.28).\nKey questions How significant was this sale relative to Robert John Terry’s direct holdings?\nThis transaction represented 19.96% of Terry’s direct shareholdings immediately prior to the sale, reducing his ownership from 24,769 to 19,824 shares. This is consistent with his median sell size over the past year.\nDoes this sale align with Terry’s historical trading patterns?\nIn the past year, Terry has made three open-market sales, each accounting for a substantial proportion of his remaining capacity, as his direct holdings have declined by 49.2% since November of last year. The current sale matches the recent median of 4,945 shares per trade.\nHow does the transaction value compare to current and historical stock prices?\nThe weighted average sale price was $62.28, just below the market close of $62.59 on November 19, 2025, and 1.2% lower than the current price of $63.05 as of November 24, 2025. Over the preceding twelve months, shares have declined 24.69% on a total return basis.\nWhat is Terry’s remaining exposure to Skyworks Solutions after this transaction?\nPost-transaction, Terry retains direct ownership of 19,824 shares, valued at approximately $1.2 million as of November 19, 2025.\n\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close 11/19/2025)\n$62.59\nMarket capitalization\n$9.31 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$4.09 billion\n1-year price change\n-25.10%\n\n* 1-year price change calculated using November 19, 2025 as the reference date.\nCompany snapshot Offers a broad portfolio of semiconductor products, including amplifiers, filters, front-end modules, and analog system-on-chip solutions.\nGenerates revenue by designing, manufacturing, and selling proprietary semiconductor components to a diversified set of end-markets.\nServes customers across the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, and wearable device markets.\n\nStory Continues\nSkyworks Solutions operates at scale with over 10,000 employees and a global footprint in the semiconductor industry. The company leverages proprietary technology and an extensive product portfolio to address high-growth connectivity and communications markets. Its strategic focus on diversified end-markets and integrated solutions positions Skyworks as a key supplier to leading OEMs and infrastructure providers worldwide.\n\nFoolish take As previously mentioned, Robert John Terry’s sale of Skyworks stock coincides with numerous sales transactions among executives at the company. Although Terry chose to retain a significant number of shares, the size of the transaction relative to his position may point to concerns.\nThe challenge investors face is determining whether the issue is related to the company or the industry in general. The state of the stock may point to the latter. One of its more prominent competitors, Texas Instruments , experienced a similar decline in its stock.\n\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is in the midst of a significant growth phase due to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Even the most advanced of these AI chips needs the RF and connectivity components like the ones Skyworks produces to power the broader ecosystem.\nAdditionally, Skyworks sells at a P/E ratio of 20, around the five-year average for its valuation. That earnings multiple could eventually bode well for attracting new investors to the company as the advancements continue.\nGlossary Form 4: A required SEC filing disclosing insider transactions in a company’s securities.\nOpen-market transaction: The purchase or sale of securities on a public exchange, not through private or pre-arranged deals.\nInsider: A company executive, director, or major shareholder with access to non-public company information.\nDirect ownership: Shares held and controlled directly by an individual, not through trusts or indirect arrangements.\nWeighted average price: The average price of shares sold or bought, weighted by the number of shares at each price.\nMedian sell size: The middle value of all insider sale amounts over a period, used to show typical transaction size.\nTotal return: The investment's price change plus all dividends and distributions, assuming those payouts are reinvested.\nOEM: Original Equipment Manufacturer; a company that produces parts or equipment used in another company’s end products.\nProprietary technology: Technology owned and controlled by a company, often protected by patents or trade secrets.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Wall Street Analysts Think Silicon Motion (SIMO) Is a Good Investment: Is It?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 22, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nThe recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Silicon Motion (SIMO).\n\nSilicon Motion currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.30, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 10 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.30 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 10 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 10% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SIMO Check price target & stock forecast for Silicon Motion here>>>\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Silicon Motion, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs SIMO Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Silicon Motion, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.55.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Silicon Motion. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Silicon Motion.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Analyst Optimism Suggests the Worst is Over For Skyworks Solutions’ (SWKS)\n\nJabran Kundi\nDecember 21, 2025 2 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nQRVO\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWKS ) is one of the 10 Most Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Invest in . On December 11, Thomas O’Kalley of Barclays maintained his Hold rating on Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) stock, along with the price target of $88. This price target remains well above the median price target of $75 and offers 31% upside from the current level.\n\nSWKS has struggled since the announcement of the merger with Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), but the stock has been rallying for the past month, and Barclays’ $88 price target may add further to the bullish sentiment. Investors were possibly spooked by the amount of time it may take for the merger to financially benefit the company. The merger is expected to be executed by early 2027, with about $500 million in cost savings expected by 2028-2029. The cash-and-stock transaction is weighing heavily on the stock, as is the risk of regulatory approval.\nThe regulatory risk stems from the fact that both Skyworks and Qorvo are competitors and significant suppliers for one company: Apple Inc.

      "Content": "Analysts Expect Outperformance As NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Ramps Down Radio Power Line\n\nJabran Kundi\nDecember 21, 2025 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nNXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI ) is one of the 10 Most Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Invest in . On December 16, Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) and raised the price target from $255 to $265. According to estimates from 34 analysts covering the stock on Wall Street, the stock has a median upside target of $265, exactly where BofA’s price target now stands.\nCantor Fitzgerald Research also made some comments on the semiconductor industry on December 16, expecting relative outperformance from NXPI stock. These two positive analyst responses come at a time when investors are fearing negative sentiment as a result of news coming out of Chandler, where the company’s ECHO fab used to manufacture parts for 5G equipment.\nAccording to an NXP spokesperson who spoke to Business Journal on December 13:\nThe Chandler facility is expected to close by 2027 after a lack of ROI on investments amid lower-than-expected global 5G deployments. The firm will completely exit the radio power market while scaling down operations at the Chandler fab.\nNXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a designer and manufacturer of semiconductor equipment based in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Its high-performance mixed-signal products are sold globally across markets such as automotive, IoT, mobile, and communication infrastructure.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of SWKS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Silicon Motion (NasdaqGS:SIMO): Assessing Valuation After Strong Earnings Momentum and Upbeat Growth Expectations\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 18, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nSilicon Motion Technology (SIMO) has been back on traders screens after a steady run of earnings beats and expectations for roughly 44% year over year profit growth this quarter, even as parts of the chip sector lag.\nSee our latest analysis for Silicon Motion Technology.\nThe stock has been choppy lately, with a 1 day share price return of 2.39% lifting it to 86.56. The standout figure is the roughly 58% year to date share price return and 65.63% one year total shareholder return, signaling that positive earnings momentum is still very much in play.\n\nGiven how SIMO has ridden the semiconductor upcycle, this could be a good moment to see what else is working in chips and hardware via high growth tech and AI stocks .\nYet with the shares still trading well below consensus price targets after such a strong run, investors are left to wonder: is Silicon Motion undervalued on its earnings momentum, or has the market already priced in the next leg of growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 24.1% Undervalued With Silicon Motion Technology closing at 86.56 versus a widely followed fair value of 114, the prevailing narrative leans toward meaningful upside from here.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how this story gets to triple digit fair value? The crux is aggressive profit growth, expanding margins, and a future earnings multiple that assumes real execution. Want to see the exact trajectory behind that conviction and where the narrative thinks growth peaks? Dive into the full breakdown and test those assumptions for yourself.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $114 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, execution missteps on next generation controllers or sharper than expected price competition could quickly undermine the upbeat growth and margin narrative around SIMO.\nFind out about the key risks to this Silicon Motion Technology narrative.\nAnother View: Cash Flows Tell a Different Story While the narrative based on future earnings points to upside, our DCF model is much more cautious, putting fair value closer to 36.82, well below the current 86.56 share price. If cash flows are right and optimism is wrong, how much margin of safety is really left?\n\n繼續閱讀\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out Silicon Motion Technology for example ).

      "Content": "Does Silicon Motion Still Offer Value After a 67.4% Surge and AI Storage Hype?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 18, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nWondering if Silicon Motion Technology is still a smart buy after its big run, or if most of the upside is already priced in? Let us unpack what the market might be missing about its value.\nThe stock is up an impressive 58.1% year to date and 67.4% over the last year, even after a recent 7.3% pullback over the past week that hints at some renewed uncertainty and opportunity.\nMuch of the recent move has been driven by optimism around demand for NAND flash controllers and broader AI related storage needs, which has pushed investors to reassess the company’s growth runway. At the same time, shifting sentiment in the semiconductor space and ongoing consolidation talk have added a layer of speculation alongside fundamentals.\nOn our valuation framework, Silicon Motion Technology scores a 3/6 for being undervalued. You can explore this in more detail via its valuation score . Next, we will walk through what different valuation approaches say about the stock, before closing with an even more intuitive way to think about its true worth.\n\nSilicon Motion Technology delivered 67.4% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: Silicon Motion Technology Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a business is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those cash flows back to today in dollar terms.\nFor Silicon Motion Technology, the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model starts from last twelve months free cash flow of about $0.49 million and uses analyst forecasts out to 2027, then extrapolates further. By 2026, free cash flow is projected at roughly $137.93 million, easing to around $121.61 million by 2035 as growth moderates from early analyst expectations to steadier long term levels.\n\nDiscounting this stream of cash flows back to today yields an estimated intrinsic value of about $36.77 per share. Compared with the current share price, this suggests the stock is roughly 135.0% above its DCF based fair value, indicating that recent optimism may already be more than reflected in the price.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Silicon Motion Technology may be overvalued by 135.0%. Discover 918 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Silicon Motion Technology.\nApproach 2: Silicon Motion Technology Price vs Earnings For a consistently profitable business like Silicon Motion Technology, the price to earnings, or PE, ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are paying for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower or more volatile earnings growth tend to pull a fair multiple down.\n\nStory Continues\nSilicon Motion currently trades on a PE of about 30.45x, which is below the broader Semiconductor industry average of roughly 36.11x and well below the peer group average of around 67.38x. On the surface, that discount could suggest the market is still somewhat cautious about the company’s earnings durability and growth profile.\n\nTo move beyond simple comparisons, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary Fair Ratio of 28.37x for Silicon Motion. This reflects its specific mix of earnings growth, margins, size, industry positioning and risk factors. This tailored benchmark is more informative than raw industry or peer averages, which can be skewed by very high growth or speculative names. With the stock’s actual PE sitting modestly above this Fair Ratio, the market appears to be pricing Silicon Motion at a slight premium to what its fundamentals imply.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1455 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Silicon Motion Technology Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, an easy framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that helps you turn your view of Silicon Motion Technology into a clear story. You can link that story to specific revenue, earnings and margin forecasts, and then translate those forecasts into a fair value you can compare to today’s price to decide whether to buy, hold or sell. The system keeps your Narrative dynamically updated as fresh earnings or news arrives. One investor might build a bullish Narrative that sees fair value closer to around $114 per share based on strong AI driven storage demand and margin expansion. Another might create a more cautious Narrative that anchors nearer to about $80 per share due to competitive and geopolitical risks. Both perspectives can coexist transparently, grounded in explicit assumptions rather than vague opinions.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Silicon Motion Technology?

      "Content": "Weak Financial Prospects Seem To Be Dragging Down Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Stock\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 17, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nIt is hard to get excited after looking at Skyworks Solutions' (NASDAQ:SWKS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 11% over the past three months. We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Skyworks Solutions' ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nHow Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Skyworks Solutions is:\n8.3% = US$477m ÷ US$5.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2025).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Skyworks Solutions' Earnings Growth And 8.3% ROE On the face of it, Skyworks Solutions' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 11% either. For this reason, Skyworks Solutions' five year net income decline of 18% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.\nHowever, when we compared Skyworks Solutions' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 5.3% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.\n\nStory Continues\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is SWKS fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Skyworks Solutions Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? Skyworks Solutions' declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 53% (or a retention ratio of 47%). With only very little left to reinvest into the business, growth in earnings is far from likely.\n\nAdditionally, Skyworks Solutions has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 50%. Still, forecasts suggest that Skyworks Solutions' future ROE will rise to 12% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.\nSummary Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Skyworks Solutions. The company has seen a lack of earnings growth as a result of retaining very little profits and whatever little it does retain, is being reinvested at a very low rate of return. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 17, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Silicon Motion falls in, has lost 6.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 points to a change of +3.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.88 indicates a change of +37.5% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Silicon Motion.\n\nLire la suite\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate of $260.55 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +36.3%. The $863.29 million and $1.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.4% and +21.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $242 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.07 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.52%. The EPS surprise was +23.46%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "How Is Skyworks Solutions' Stock Performance Compared to Other Semiconductor Stocks?\n\nAditya Sarawgi\nDecember 17, 2025 2 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nIrvine, California-based Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS) designs, manufactures, and markets a broad range of high-performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors that enable wireless connectivity. With a market cap of $9.8 billion, the company’s operations span the US, Indo-Pacific, and EMEA region.\n\nCompanies worth between $2 billion and $10 billion are generally described as \"mid-cap stocks.\" SWKS fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size and influence in the semiconductor industry.\nMore News from Barchart While AI Panic Struck Applied Digital (APLD) Stock, the Smart Money Has a Different View\nJPMorgan Says to Sell NVDA March $160 Puts. Should You Actually?\nShould You Buy Micron Stock Before December 17? This Analyst Thinks So.\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\nSkyworks touched its 52-week high of $95.46 on Jan. 21 and is currently trading 30.8% below that peak. Meanwhile, SWKS stock has declined 11.1% over the past three months, notably lagging behind the iShares Semiconductor ETF’s (SOXX) 14.6% surge during the same time frame.\nSkyworks’ performance has remained grim over the longer term as well. SWKS stock has plunged 25.6% on a YTD basis and 27.3% over the past 52 weeks, significantly underperforming SOXX’s 37.5% surge in 2025 and 30.2% returns over the past year.\nSWKS stock has traded mostly below its 200-day moving average over the past year, with some notable fluctuations and consistently below its 50-day moving average since early November, underscoring its bearish trend.\nSkyworks Solutions’ stock prices gained more than 2% in the trading session following the release of its impressive Q4 results on Nov. 4. During the quarter, the company secured 5G content across premium Android smartphones, including Google Pixel 10, Samsung Galaxy S25, and others. Further, it also expanded in-vehicle infotainment programs with BYD, Stellantis, and a leading Korean OEM.\n\nMeanwhile, Skyworks reported a notable 7.3% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.1 billion, beating the Street’s expectations by a significant margin. Moreover, SWKS delivered a notable 13.5% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.76, surpassing the consensus estimates by more than 15%.\nNonetheless, Skyworks has also underperformed its peer, Analog Devices, Inc.’s (ADI) 31% surge in 2025 and 28.7% returns over the past 52 weeks.\nAmong the 25 analysts covering the SWKS stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” Its mean price target of $84.56 suggests a 28.1% upside potential from current price levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Sarawgi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Does Qorvo’s 2025 Rebound and 28.2% Surge Justify Its Current Valuation?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 12, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QRVO\n\nWondering if Qorvo at around $89 is quietly becoming a value play or still a risky semiconductor bet? This breakdown is designed to help you decide without the jargon.\nThe stock is up 0.5% over the last week, 3.3% over the past month, and 28.2% year to date, but those gains still sit against a 5 year return of about -44.0%.\nRecently, Qorvo has stayed in the spotlight as investors focus on the long term demand for radio frequency chips in smartphones, 5G infrastructure, and connected devices. In addition, ongoing attention on reshoring and semiconductor supply chains continues to shape how the market prices companies like Qorvo.\nDespite all that interest, Qorvo only scores 1/6 on our valuation checks . We will walk through what different valuation methods are actually saying about the stock, then finish with a more holistic way to think about its real worth.\n\nQorvo scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Qorvo Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a business is worth today by projecting the cash it could generate in the future, then discounting those cash flows back to the present.\nFor Qorvo, the model starts with last twelve months free cash flow of about $539 million. Analysts provide detailed forecasts for the next few years, and beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates further out to build a 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Under these assumptions, Qorvo’s free cash flow is projected to rise to around $730 million by 2035, still in dollar terms.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the intrinsic value is estimated at roughly $74.31 per share. With the stock trading near $89, the DCF output implies Qorvo is about 20.3% overvalued on this cash flow outlook.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Qorvo may be overvalued by 20.3%. Discover 903 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Qorvo.\nApproach 2: Qorvo Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Qorvo, the price to earnings (PE) ratio is a useful shorthand for how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster earnings growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tend to pull that multiple down.\n\nQorvo currently trades on a PE of about 38.0x, which is roughly in line with the broader Semiconductor industry average of around 38.0x, but above the peer group average near 34.5x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio of 29.1x for Qorvo, which represents the PE you might expect given its specific mix of earnings growth, margins, industry positioning, market cap and risk profile.\n\nLeer más\nThis Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or sector averages because it adjusts for Qorvo’s own fundamentals rather than assuming it deserves the same multiple as every other chip company. With the shares at 38.0x versus a Fair Ratio of 29.1x, the multiple based view suggests Qorvo is trading at a premium to what its fundamentals currently justify.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1447 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Qorvo Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This is a simple framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you tell the story behind your numbers by linking your view of Qorvo’s future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast, a fair value estimate and a clear buy or sell signal. That fair value is compared to today’s price and then dynamically updated when new information, like merger news or earnings, comes in. For example, a bullish investor might build a Narrative that leans into 5G, 6G and merger synergies to justify a fair value closer to the high end of recent targets near $128. A more cautious investor could emphasize customer concentration, regulatory risk and handset cyclicality to land nearer the low end around $70. Both perspectives can coexist on the platform as approachable, side by side stories that may make it easier to decide whether Qorvo at about $89 appears attractively priced, fully valued, or too expensive for a given personal outlook.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Qorvo?

      "Content": "Is It Too Late To Consider Tower Semiconductor After Its 140% 2025 Rally?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 9, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nIf you are wondering whether Tower Semiconductor is still a smart buy after such a huge run up in its share price, or if you might be late to the party, this article will break down what the current valuation is actually telling us.\nThe stock has surged recently, climbing 6.5% over the last week, 47.5% over the past month, and an eye catching 140.5% year to date, while delivering a 384.0% gain over 5 years.\nThose moves have been driven by growing investor enthusiasm around analog and specialty semiconductor demand, as well as Tower's strategic positioning as a foundry partner for companies that want alternatives to the largest chip manufacturers. At the same time, shifting expectations about industry consolidation and long term chip demand cycles have added a layer of both excitement and volatility to the story.\nDespite that performance, Tower Semiconductor currently scores just 0/6 on our undervaluation checks. In this article we will walk through what different valuation approaches say about the stock today, and then wrap up by looking at a more holistic way to think about its overall worth.\n\nTower Semiconductor scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Tower Semiconductor Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a business is worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back into today’s dollars using a required rate of return.\nFor Tower Semiconductor, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company is currently generating negative free cash flow of about $25.1 Million, but analysts and extrapolations see this swinging to positive territory and then scaling materially. Projections point to free cash flow reaching roughly $34.3 Million in 2026 and climbing to about $1.43 Billion by 2035, all in $ terms. Simply Wall St only uses direct analyst estimates for the early years, then extrapolates further growth based on recent trends.\n\nAfter discounting this stream of future cash flows, the DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of around $63.19 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies the stock is about 96.2% overvalued.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Tower Semiconductor may be overvalued by 96.2%. Discover 903 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Tower Semiconductor.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: Tower Semiconductor Price vs Earnings For a profitable business like Tower Semiconductor, the price to earnings (PE) ratio is a useful way to see how much investors are willing to pay today for each dollar of current earnings. It ties directly to what the company is actually making now, which makes it more intuitive than cash flow models for many investors.\n\nWhat counts as a “normal” PE depends on how quickly earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher growth and lower perceived risk usually justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tend to hold the PE down.\nTower currently trades on a PE of 71.2x, which is well above both the Semiconductor industry average of 38.0x and the average of its peers at 44.5x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 45.6x, which is the PE you might expect once you factor in Tower’s specific mix of earnings growth, profitability, industry, market cap and risk profile. Because this Fair Ratio is tailored to Tower, it is more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry.\nWith the current PE of 71.2x sitting materially above the 45.6x Fair Ratio, the shares look expensive on this metric.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1450 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Tower Semiconductor Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you turn your view of a company into a story tied to a financial forecast and a fair value. You can compare that fair value with the current price and decide when to buy or sell. You can also track how it updates automatically as new news or earnings arrive, and even see how different investors can look at the same Tower Semiconductor data and reach very different conclusions. For example, one Narrative might lean bullish, assuming accelerating RF Infrastructure and Silicon Photonics growth that justifies a fair value closer to $124 or even $135. A more cautious Narrative might focus on capital intensity, execution and concentration risks and land nearer the low $59 to $60 range. Both perspectives use the same building blocks of future revenues, margins and multiples, just arranged into different, clearly explained stories behind the numbers.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Tower Semiconductor?

The full narrative unpacks the bold forecasts behind that fair value and why 2027 could be a turning point for Tower’s earnings mix.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $124 (ABOUT RIGHT)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, execution missteps on Tower’s heavy CapEx buildout, or a faster than expected shift in optical transceiver technologies, could quickly challenge today’s optimistic assumptions.\nFind out about the key risks to this Tower Semiconductor narrative.\nBuild Your Own Tower Semiconductor Narrative If the consensus story does not fully resonate or you prefer to dig into the numbers yourself, you can build a custom view in minutes, Do it your way .\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 1 key reward investors are optimistic about regarding Tower Semiconductor.\nLooking for your next investing edge?
