      "Content": "NVDA\n\nGC=F\n\nBTC-USD\n\nSilver surged to $82.7 per ounce in early Asian trading hours, nearing its recent all-time high (ATH). The precious metal briefly overtook NVIDIA to become the world’s second-largest asset by market capitalization.\nThe move has drawn significant attention across financial markets. Analysts are increasingly comparing silver to Bitcoin, with some suggesting the cryptocurrency could be poised for a similar breakout.\n\nPrecious Metal Rally Elevates Silver Above Tech Giant Following a modest correction from its previous all-time high, silver extended its gains beyond $80 per ounce, reaching a high of $82.7 today. The latest rally pushed silver’s market capitalization above NVIDIA’s $4.55 trillion.\nAt press time, the precious metal was trading at $80.8, up nearly 12% year to date. These gains even outpace gold, which has risen around 3.2% so far in 2026.\nSilver’s outperformance is not a recent development. Even in 2025, the metal exceeded gold's advance, rising approximately 176% over the year, compared with a 70.3% gain in gold.\nMarket observers attribute silver's strength to its dual role. Investors buy it as a monetary or safe-haven asset, similar to gold.\nOn the other hand, silver plays a critical role in industrial applications, particularly in electronics, solar panels, artificial intelligence hardware, and electric vehicles. BeInCrypto recently highlighted that industrial demand accounts for approximately half of global silver consumption.\nAccording to the analyst , a persistent supply-demand imbalance has fueled silver's rally. The Silver Institute reported that the global silver market saw its fifth straight annual deficit in 2025. Annual demand stands at approximately 1.2 billion ounces, while mine production and recycling only supply around 1 billion ounces.\nThis structural shortfall has helped sustain upward momentum, with many market participants forecasting that silver could reach triple-digit prices in 2026.\nhttps://twitter.com/wmiddelkoop/status/2008534045135958103?s=20\nHowever, when demand consistently exceeds supply, prices typically rise until consumption begins to decline, a process known as demand destruction. In silver’s case, higher prices could eventually make certain industrial uses uneconomic.\n\nStory Continues\nBitcoin Analysts See Silver Parallels Silver’s record rally has prompted many cryptocurrency market analysts to examine Bitcoin’s chart. Merlijn The Trader observed that silver completed a multi-year cup-and-handle formation ahead of its surge.\nThe post suggests Bitcoin is now in a similar phase, quietly building the same structure on the weekly chart. The implication is that, as with silver, once this pattern completes, Bitcoin could break out sharply to the upside.\nAnalyst Crypto Rover added that gold and silver surged sharply after breaking out of their monthly accumulation zones. According to the analyst, Bitcoin has yet to confirm a similar breakout, but once it does, it could trigger a powerful catch-up rally.\n\nMarket participants are also watching for a potential capital rotation from precious metals into Bitcoin. When and if such a shift materializes remains to be seen.\nRead original story Silver Briefly Overtakes NVIDIA: What the Rally Could Signal for Bitcoin by Kamina Bashir at beincrypto.com",

What begins as a test of courage in the jungle evolves into a mystery that stretches across decades and continents. When Jay, the son of Russian refugees fluent in his parents' language, is captured and handed over to Soviet forces, rumors of Australian prisoners in the USSR ignite questions no government dares answer.\n\nCombining historical accuracy with fast-paced storytelling, \"Ballot: When Fate Called Their Name\" examines how ideology, identity and allegiance collide when choice is stripped away. \"It's not a war story per-se,\" Mulvagh describes. \"It goes beyond the horror of combat, and explores the oscillations of xenophobic and patriotic pressures experienced by a generation in the 60s and 70s and 80s, the collisions of ingrained world-views, of allegiance and identity, of mateship that transcends decades, continents, and opposing political and social philosophies. It entertains and provokes simultaneously.\"\n\"Ballot: When Fate Called Their Name\" is a deeply human exploration of fate, friendship and resilience that resonate far beyond its time and place. It is an invitation for readers to confront the uneasy parallels between past and present — from the Cold War to today's geopolitical rifts.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nSamsung Reimagines the Future of Design at CES 2026, Guiding Technology for Humanity\n\nPR Newswire\nTue, January 6, 2026 at 9:57 PM PST 4 min read\n\nThe concluding session of Samsung's CES 2026 Tech Forum series highlighted the human side of technology with leading designers\nLAS VEGAS , Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd. today held the final session in its CES 2026 Tech Forum series, 'The Human Side of Tech: Designing a Future Worth Living,' at Samsung's The First Look space at The Wynn Las Vegas. The panel, moderated by Debbie Millman, host of 'Design Matters,' featured Samsung Chief Design Officer Mauro Porcini and industry-leading designers Karim Rashid and Fabio Novembre.\nWith minimalism having defined the visual language of the tech industry for the past two decades, this panel of designers convened by Samsung asked: What comes next? Together, the panelists explored how warmer, more expressive and emotionally resonant technology can shape meaningful experiences in today's AI era, while also charting a path forward for the industry.\n\nDesign as an Act of Love\nThe session covered a shared view on the purpose of design as fundamentally people-first. \"In recent years, design in tech has been somewhat uniform,\" said moderator Debbie Millman. \"Compared to other industries, the uniformity in the world of tech is an anomaly. So what if we were to extend technology beyond specifications and functionality?\"\nSamsung is currently addressing this question by introducing meaning beyond products by focusing on how technology fits into people's lives, experiences and needs. The panelists discussed the growing importance of this mindset in the current landscape in which traditional barriers to entry such as access to tools, scale and technical capability continue to diminish.\n\nThe Human Side of Tech\nThe discussion highlighted technology's role in making intention, care and humanity visible in everyday life. Panelists noted that technology should help people recognize the thoughtfulness embedded in the products they invite into their homes and routines.\nIn this context, Samsung Chief Design Officer Mauro Porcini shared Samsung's design purpose: to enrich the quality of people's lives through meaningful technology designed for humanity. He outlined the company's commitment to help people live longer, live better, live louder and live on through advanced technologies that support wellbeing, creativity and self-expression.\nPanelist Karim Rashid added to this sentiment, saying, \"When we think about physical things in our world, we think not only about diversity of choice but also the fact that we can develop strong connections to objects,\" he said. \"Through design, you can end up with a very powerful, emotional connection with inanimate objects, or even products.\"\n\nStory Continues\nDesigning for Human Values\nThe panel went on to explore how AI can unlock new possibilities for expression when shaped by human values. Panelists discussed a shared view that AI reaches its true potential when guided by Emotional Intelligence and Human Imagination, not as a replacement for human creativity but as a force that expands it.\n\nCDO Porcini articulated this with \"AI × (EI + HI),\" his approach to balancing Emotional Intelligence and Human Imagination to bring meaning to innovation. While describing this philosophy, CDO Porcini said, \"When we design and develop, AI is amplified by Emotional Intelligence and Human Imagination. Then, when people use products, AI amplifies Emotional Intelligence and Human Imagination.\" He added, \"Do not fear technology. We are here to humanize it, guide it, and shape it.\"\nThrough these insights, the session reinforced the belief that technology should be humanized, guided and shaped to serve people's lives in increasingly new and meaningful ways.\nExpressive Design Drives More Meaningful Experiences\nThe discussion reinforced the importance of expressive design in bringing human-centered purpose to life, creating experiences that reflect emotion, support self-expression, invite connection and stimulate imagination.\n\n\"Happiness is the aim of design,\" said Fabio Novembre. \"Our pursuit of happiness is through design, making the impossible possible. I strongly believe in design, and that it must move back to the center of the stage.\"\nPanelists noted that this reflects a shift from merely designing objects to designing experiences where emotion, meaning and identity are increasingly integral to how people relate to technology. This approach inspires a new kind of expression, resulting in designs that range from subtle and minimal to bold and imaginative — all meant to shape a future that isn't just worth living, but worth loving.\nAbout Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nSamsung inspires the world and shapes the future with transformative ideas and technologies.

      "Content": "Recent stock move and why it matters Arm Holdings (NasdaqGS:ARM) has come under pressure after a rival acquisition in chip design, with the stock weaker even as investors weigh Arm’s AI positioning and potential royalty upside from newer architectures.\nSee our latest analysis for Arm Holdings.\nAt a share price of $115.53, Arm’s short term price momentum has cooled, with a 30 day share price return of 18.24% and a 90 day share price return of 30.73%. The 1 year total shareholder return of 19.98% reflects how investors have been reassessing growth potential and competitive risks after the rival chip design deal and recent institutional repositioning.\n\nIf Arm’s AI story has your attention, this can be a good moment to widen your lens and check out high growth tech and AI stocks for other potential ideas in the space.\nWith Arm shares sitting at $115.53 after a 1 year total return of 19.98%, the key question is whether current enthusiasm for its AI royalties leaves upside on the table, or if markets are already pricing in future growth.\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 65% Overvalued With Arm shares at $115.53 and the narrative fair value at $70, the gap between price and valuation assumptions is front and center for investors.\nARM Holdings continues to benefit from its irreplaceable role in the global semiconductor ecosystem, powering everything from smartphones to AI edge devices. Based on a forward earnings framework anchored to the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, the stock’s intrinsic fair value is estimated at $70 per share. Applying a prudent 20% discount to reflect interest rate risk and macro uncertainty yields a conservative, risk-adjusted target of $56.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nWant to see how forward earnings, required returns and profit margins fit together in this view? The narrative leans on ambitious growth, rich multiples and a tight risk premium. Curious which assumptions really carry the weight in that $70 fair value call? According to jaikhom, the details matter.\nResult: Fair Value of $70 (OVERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, that view could be challenged if AI related royalty growth, margins, or interest rate expectations shift in a way that changes earnings yield assumptions.\nFind out about the key risks to this Arm Holdings narrative.\nBuild Your Own Arm Holdings Narrative If you see the numbers differently or want to stress test your own assumptions, you can build a data‑driven Arm story yourself in a few minutes: Do it your way .\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards investors are optimistic about regarding Arm Holdings.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking for more investment ideas?

Following the event, they updated their opinion on NVDA stock in a research note shared with TheStreet.\nThe team said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that “very high” demand for AI computing continues, and announced the new Vera Rubin AI platform.\n\nAnalysts noted their highlights from the event: AI scaling remains on track, with five times the token generation and 10 times the cost reduction per year.\nSix new AI chips were announced for the Vera Rubin platform, slated for the second half of 2026.\nThe company unveiled a new pod-level context memory storage platform.\nNvidia continues to run every single major LLM today.\nAI will be funded by the modernization of AI and the shifting of R&D methods.\nThe Groq/SRAM deal could be beneficial for extremely low-latency workloads.\nAI is scaling beyond LLMs, into physical AI.\nChina's H200 demand is there, but it is still awaiting licenses.\n\nAn informed and careful reader will notice that the analyst team must have overlooked the fact that Google Gemini 3 was trained and is running on Google’s own TPUs, as reported by CNBC .\nThe team said Nvidia’s continued dominance in AI compute, networking system, and ecosystem is trading at just approximately 19 multiple price to earnings ratio, or in line with the broader S&P 500 index, despite its superior, greater-than-35% EPS CAGR and upwards of 40% free cash flow .\nArya reiterated a buy rating and the target price of $275, based on 28 multiple his estimate for price-to-earnings ratio excluding cash for calendar year 2027, which is within Nvidia’s historical forward year price-to-earnings range of 25 to 56.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts noted downside risk factors for Nvidia: Weakness in the consumer-driven gaming market\nCompetition with major public firms\nLarger-than-expected impact from restrictions on compute shipments to China\nLumpy and unpredictable sales in new enterprise, data center, and autos\nmarkets\nPotential for decelerating capital returns\nEnhanced government scrutiny of Nvidia’s dominant market position in AI\nchips\n\nKey Nvidia CES announcements Nvidia unveiled its next-generation AI Rubin platform, consisting of six new chips.\nThe Rubin platform uses extreme co-design across its six chips: the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, NVLink 6 Switch, ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, BlueField-4 data processing unit (DPU), and Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch.\n“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof. With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI,” stated Huang.\n\nRelated: Bank of America resets Micron stock price target, rating\nThe company also launched its Alpamayo family of open AI models, simulation tools, and datasets, designed for reasoning-based autonomous vehicle (AV) development. According to the company, the Alpamayo family introduces chain-of-thought, reasoning-based vision language action models that bring humanlike thinking to AV decision-making.\nHuang stated: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here — when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit. Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decisions — it’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nSiemens and Nvidia announced an expansion of their partnership for the development of industrial and physical AI solutions.\nRoland Busch, president and CEO of Siemens AG , stated: “Together, we are building the Industrial AI operating system — redefining how the physical world is designed, built and run — to scale AI and create real-world impact. By combining Nvidia’s leadership in accelerated computing and AI platforms with Siemens’ leading hardware, software, industrial AI and data, we’re empowering customers to develop products faster with the most comprehensive digital twins, adapt production in real time and accelerate technologies from chips to AI factories.”\nThe companies plan to build the world’s first fully AI-driven, adaptive manufacturing sites. The first one, according to the plan, is the Siemens Electronics Factory in Erlangen, Germany, in 2026.\nRelated: Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 7, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Key Points Tesla's core electric vehicle business has struggled amid rising competition and industry headwinds in the U.S.\nHowever, investors have largely looked past these concerns.\nThe market appears to be more focused on Tesla's emerging robotaxi fleet and other initiatives.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nThe electric vehicle maker and robotaxi company Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) recently reported its EV deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2025. Once again, the numbers showed a stark decline from the prior year, as the electric vehicle market continues to suffer during the transition under the Trump administration, which has eliminated several incentives for the industry.\nHowever, investors are largely looking past these concerns and focusing on other aspects of Tesla's business, which they hope will be material drivers of the stock in the years to come.\nEV business struggled, but as expected Tesla reported EV deliveries of 418,227 for the fourth quarter of 2025. According to CNBC, Wall Street analysts had been expecting approximately 426,000 deliveries, so the company missed the consensus by about 2%. Fourth-quarter deliveries declined by nearly 16% year over year. For the year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, a decrease of approximately 9% from 2024.\nThe company said that 97% of its total deliveries in the fourth quarter came from its Model 3 Sedan and Model Y SUV. Deliveries of the company's Model S, Model X, and Cybertrucks were minimal during the quarter.\nFewer deliveries are nothing new and have become an industrywide trend. President Donald Trump's large legislative spending package, passed last year, eliminated a $7,500 federal EV tax credit that had been viewed as a key incentive for those purchasing EVs. Furthermore, Tesla has experienced competition globally from players like BYD , which recently surpassed Tesla as the world's largest EV maker.\n\nInvestors are focused on robotaxis and robots Despite the EV struggles, the market has been aware of the problem for much of the year and largely looked past it. That's because investors are now much more focused on the company's emerging robotaxi fleet and Optimus humanoid robots. Last year, Tesla soft-launched its self-driving robotaxis in Austin and San Francisco, marking a key milestone that CEO Elon Musk had discussed for years. The company plans to launch in five new cities in the coming months.\n\nHowever, up until recently, many of Tesla's robotaxis have not been fully autonomous, as the launches have been geofenced with some sort of supervision, whether it is remote supervision or safety monitors on each trip. In mid December, Musk confirmed that some of Austin's robotaxis were operating without any supervision in the vehicles.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla's potential advantage is that it can supposedly manufacture its fully autonomous self-driving vehicles at a much lower cost than competitors like Waymo, according to a Bloomberg analysis.\nThe robotaxi will be key to moving Tesla's stock higher. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees Tesla robotaxis operating in 30 cities by the end of 2026, which will add significant value to the stock. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, another Tesla bull, has a $2,600 price target on Tesla by 2029, which implies a ton of upside, given Tesla's current share price of roughly $450. Much of this will be driven by robotaxis. Wood and her team believe the robotaxi business will comprise 90% of the company's enterprise value and earnings by 2029.\n\nInvestors also believe Tesla's humanoid Optimus robots could bring significant value to the company. Musk has discussed the potential for wider-scale production of the robots this year, which could save people a significant amount of time due to their ability to complete household chores.\nOverall, I think it's clear that Tesla's current $1.5 trillion market cap and future price appreciation hinge largely on robotaxis, and to some extent, Optimus robots. I'd advise investors to be cautious here. Tesla is undoubtedly an impressive company, but the stock is currently valued at over 200 times forward earnings.\nThat's a lot to pay for a company that still has a lot to accomplish in terms of robotaxis and humanoid robots. It remains unclear whether and when Tesla will perfect the technology and the rate of adoption. At these levels, I do not find the risk-reward trade-off to be attractive.\n\nWe just issued 'double down' alerts on 3 stocks — find out if Tesla made our list Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nIn early January 2026, Hesai Technology announced plans to more than double its annual lidar production capacity to over 4 million units by 2026, while also being selected as a lidar partner for NVIDIA’s DRIVE Hyperion platform and expanding into new applications such as MOVIN’s lidar-based motion-capture systems.\nThese moves highlight how Hesai is trying to position itself at the center of both Level 3–4 automotive autonomy and emerging “physical AI” use cases, from robotaxis and EV ADAS to consumer and industrial robotics.\nWe’ll now examine how Hesai’s decision to double lidar production capacity could reshape the company’s existing investment narrative and risk-reward profile.\n\nThe end of cancer?

      "Title": "A Look At Aeva Technologies (AEVA) Valuation After NVIDIA And LG Innotek LiDAR Milestones",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-aeva-technologies-aeva-valuation-031507811.html",
      "Content": "AEVA\n\n011070.KS\n\nAeva Technologies (AEVA) has drawn fresh attention after its 4D LiDAR was selected for NVIDIA’s DRIVE Hyperion autonomous vehicle platform, followed immediately by the launch of the Aeva Omni short range 4D LiDAR with LG Innotek.\nSee our latest analysis for Aeva Technologies.\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion win and the LG Innotek partnership arrived alongside a sharp swing in sentiment, with Aeva’s 1-day share price return of 34.38% and 7-day share price return of 33.26% at a latest share price of $17.59, while the 1-year total shareholder return of 252.50% contrasts with a 5-year total shareholder return of negative 79.15%. This suggests strong recent momentum after a difficult longer history.\n\nIf news like NVIDIA and LG Innotek working with Aeva has your attention, it could be a good moment to scan other high growth tech and AI stocks that are catching the market’s eye.\nWith NVIDIA and LG Innotek now in the picture, Aeva’s story looks very different from a year ago. Do the recent returns and implied intrinsic discount hint at undervaluation, or is the market already pricing in future growth?\nPrice to Book of 31.8x: Is it justified? Aeva screens very differently depending on the lens you use, with our DCF estimate of fair value at $61.48 versus a last close of $17.59, while the current P/B multiple sits far above peers.\nOur DCF model estimates a fair value by projecting future cash flows and discounting them back to today using an appropriate rate. This kind of approach can be useful for early stage, loss making tech businesses where earnings based multiples such as P/E are not yet meaningful. However, investors should keep in mind that any DCF output is sensitive to the long term assumptions that sit underneath it.\n\nFor Aeva, that tension is clear. On one side, the model implies the shares are trading at a roughly 71% discount to fair value. On the other side, the company is currently unprofitable, reported a net loss of $156.26 million on revenue of $15.154 million, and is forecast to remain loss making over the next three years even as revenue is expected to grow strongly. That mix of rapid top line growth forecasts and ongoing losses is typical of high risk, high potential stories in emerging technologies.\nGiven this backdrop, some investors may prefer to treat the DCF fair value as one reference point rather than a precise target. This can be particularly relevant when analyst price targets are both higher than the current price and based on a range of views that are not tightly clustered. The key question for anyone looking at Aeva is how comfortable they are with forecasts that assume strong revenue growth, while profitability remains some way off.\n\nStory Continues\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nResult: DCF fair value of $61.48 (UNDERVALUED)\nHowever, there are clear pressure points here, including ongoing losses compared with modest revenue of $15.154 million and a very high 31.8x P/B multiple.\nFind out about the key risks to this Aeva Technologies narrative.\n\nAnother View: What The High P/B Ratio Is Saying Set against the SWS DCF model, the current P/B of 31.8x sends a very different signal. It is far above both the peer average of 6.6x and the wider US Electronic industry at 2.4x, so anyone buying today is accepting a lot more valuation risk if expectations cool.\nThat gap can reflect belief in Aeva’s technology and growth forecasts, but it also leaves less room for disappointment if revenue or adoption do not match the current excitement. With the share price already pricing in much richer terms than peers, how comfortable are you paying this premium?\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out Aeva Technologies for example ).

      "Content": "Meta’s $2 billion acquisition of AI assistant platform Manus is unsurprisingly caught in a regulatory tug-of-war — but not because of U.S. regulators. They appear assured that the deal is legitimate despite earlier misgivings about Benchmark’s investment in Manus. China’s regulators, however, are reportedly not quite as sanguine , according to the Financial Times.\n\nWhen Benchmark led a financing round for Manus earlier this year, the investment sparked immediate controversy. U.S. Senator John Cornyn complained about the deal on X, and the investment prompted inquiries from the U.S. Treasury Department around new rules restricting American investment in Chinese AI companies.\nThe concerns were significant enough to spur Manus’s eventual relocation from Beijing to Singapore — part of what drove the company’s “step-by-step disentanglement from China,” as one Chinese professor described it on WeChat this past weekend.\nNow the tables have turned. Chinese officials are reportedly reviewing whether the Meta deal violates technology export controls, potentially giving Beijing leverage it wasn’t initially perceived as having. Specifically, they’re examining whether Manus needed an export license when it relocated its core team from China to Singapore — a move that’s apparently now so common it has earned the nickname “Singapore washing.” A recent Wall Street Journal article speculated that China has “few tools to influence the deal given Manus’s foothold in Singapore,” but that assessment may have been premature.\n\nThe concern in Beijing is that this deal could encourage more Chinese startups to physically relocate to dodge domestic oversight. Winston Ma, a professor at New York University School of Law and partner at Dragon Capital, told the Journal that if the deal closes smoothly, “It creates a new path for the young AI startups in China.”\nHistory suggests Beijing could act. China previously used similar export control mechanisms to intervene in Trump’s attempted TikTok ban during his first term. The Chinese professor even warned on WeChat that Manus’ founders could face criminal liability if they exported restricted technology without authorization.\nMeanwhile, some U.S. analysts are calling the acquisition a win for Washington’s investment restrictions, arguing it shows Chinese AI talent is defecting to the American ecosystem. One expert told the FT that the deal demonstrates “the US AI ecosystem is currently more attractive.”\nIt’s too early to know if this impacts Meta’s plans to integrate Manus’s AI agent software into its products, but this $2 billion deal may have gotten more complicated than anyone anticipated.",

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】台股連2天上演拉「積」盤！昨（6）日在台積電衝上1705元下，再漲471點至3萬0576點，續創新高，相較台積電2天合計大漲120元，鴻海即使12月營收奏捷，2025年營收攻破8兆元，但股價卻在平盤上下游走，遲遲無法衝破240元，表現相對平淡。\n\n資深分析師陳榮華表示，資金排擠、財報基期墊高是4大關鍵主因，但以鴻海2025年EPS可達15元推算，當前本益比低，下檔230元附近支撐強勁，若能站穩239.2元，股價就有機會挑戰265元的前高位置。\n\n鴻海5日公布去年12月營收，單月營收8629億元，月增2.2%、年增31.77%，全年營收達8兆998億元，年增18.07%，雙雙改寫歷年新高，但鴻海在亮眼營收公布後，股價衝高又回落，讓許多投資者感到困惑。\n\n陳榮華指出，市場對利多數據的反應主要取決於「是否超出預期」及「未來怎麼走」，此次股價調整的主要原因有四，包括：\n\n1.利多出盡與獲利了結：優秀的年度和季度營收數據，已被市場普遍預期，股價在數據公布前已累積一定漲幅，當預期兌現時，部分資金選擇獲利了結，造成短線賣壓。\n\n2.高基期挑戰：2025年第4季強勁增長超預期，為2026年第1季設立了較高的比較基期。\n\n3.產品結構分化：雖然整體營收增長，但增長動能主要來自AI相關的雲網路產品和元件產品，傳統的消費電子和電腦終端產品在12月及第4季同比衰退，顯示鴻海的增長引擎正在切換，市場也正在評估其傳統業務放緩的影響。\n\n4.AI新平台的雙刃劍效應：黃仁勳在CES 2026上發布Rubin平台，雖為供應鏈帶來長期題材，但也可能促使部分投資者將目光轉向更上游的晶片或技術公司，對代工廠的短期資金產生分流。\n\n總結來看，陳榮華認為，鴻海當前股價拉回是「已知利多兌現」和「未來增長結構變化」共同引發的正常市場博弈，AI伺服器業務是明確的增長引擎，但尚需時間完全抵消傳統業務的周期性影響。\n\n不過，以鴻海2025年預估EPS15元計算，陳榮華認為，當前股價的本益比較低，估值具有吸引力，若股價回落到220元附近，預期會有支撐買盤進場，未來股價仍有機會挑戰265元的前高位置。\n\n就長期價值投資者來說，可重點關注其低本益比的估值優勢，以及AI業務帶來的長期轉型潛力，若股價出現顯著回調，會是不錯的分批關注時機；短線交易者則需留意239元附近壓力和成交量變化，在趨勢明確突破前，可能需要更多耐心。\n\n最後，陳榮華從技術線型分析，鴻海去年10/26來到265元的高價後出現大幅回檔，在12/18來到213.5元低價，昨（6）日高點239後震盪，操作可以參考下列數據\n\n265-213.5=51.5\n\n213.5+(51.5*0.5)=239.2(關鍵多空轉折點，站穩挑戰245-265高價區)\n\n213.5+(51.5*0.382)=233(拉回支撐位沒有跌破230都算有效支撐)\n\n短線剛好遇到反彈的關鍵轉折拉回屬正常，下方230的支撐沒破在外資回補支持下仍偏多看待。\n\n※免責聲明：文中所提之個股、ETF內容，並非任何投資建議與參考，請審慎判斷評估風險，自負盈虧。(新聞來源：旺得富理財網 李宗莉)",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-avgo-still-sensibly-priced-021220900.html",
      "Content": "If you are wondering whether Broadcom's share price still makes sense after a huge run in recent years, you are not alone and the numbers tell an interesting story.\nThe stock closed at US$343.58 most recently, after a 1.8% decline over the last week and a 12.0% decline over the past month, even though the 1 year return sits at 51.6% and the 3 year gain is very large at around 5x.\nRecent headlines have focused on Broadcom's role in key semiconductor markets and its position in large scale technology infrastructure, which has kept investor interest high. These themes help explain why the share price has seen both strong long term gains and shorter term pullbacks as expectations and perceived risks adjust.\nOur Simply Wall St valuation checks suggest Broadcom is undervalued on only 1 of 6 measures, giving it a valuation score of 1/6 . Next we will look at what traditional models say about that price tag and then finish with a different way to think about what the stock might really be worth.\n\nBroadcom scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Broadcom Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model takes projected future cash flows and discounts them back to today using a required rate of return. This gives a single estimate of what the business might be worth right now.\nFor Broadcom, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $26.9b. Using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, analysts and extrapolated estimates point to projected Free Cash Flow of $107.1b in 2030. A set of annual projections between 2026 and 2035 has been discounted back to today by Simply Wall St using its own assumptions.\n\nAdding up those discounted cash flows and the terminal value gives an estimated intrinsic value of $286.36 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $343.58, this implies the stock is around 20.0% above the DCF estimate, so on this measure Broadcom screens as overvalued rather than cheap.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Broadcom may be overvalued by 20.0%. Discover 877 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Broadcom.\nApproach 2: Broadcom Price vs Earnings For profitable companies, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you pay for each share to the earnings that business is currently generating. In general, higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more cautious range.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom currently trades on a P/E of 70.44x. That sits well above the Semiconductor industry average of 38.66x and also above its peer group average of 56.19x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio”, which is the P/E they would expect for Broadcom after considering factors like its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk. For Broadcom, this Fair Ratio is 55.11x.\n\nThis Fair Ratio can be more useful than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for Broadcom’s specific characteristics rather than assuming all semiconductor companies should trade on the same multiple. Set against the current P/E of 70.44x, the Fair Ratio of 55.11x suggests the stock is pricing in more optimism than that model supports.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1449 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Broadcom Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about value. Narratives let you turn your view of Broadcom into a simple story that links its AI partnerships, customer concentration and VMware integration to a set of future revenue, earnings and margin assumptions. These then flow through to a Fair Value you can compare with today’s price on Simply Wall St’s Community page, updating automatically as news and earnings arrive. For example, one investor might build a bullish Broadcom Narrative around the higher consensus Fair Value of about US$404 and strong AI-related expectations. Another might anchor on the lower analyst price target of US$218 that reflects more caution around competition, customer risk and debt.

      "Content": "(Bloomberg) -- Research analysts are scrambling to raise price targets on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares, underscoring continued bullishness on the chipmaking giant after its record surge.\nAt least six brokerages, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie Group Ltd., have lifted projections on the Taipei-listed stock since the start of the year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. hiked its target 24% to NT$2,100 in a report Wednesday, citing expectations of strong revenue growth and improving profitability.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\nTSMC shares are up 8% so far in 2026, after more than tripling over the past three years on relentless investor demand for one of the key global drivers of the artificial intelligence boom. Its rally has propelled Taiwan’s benchmark equity index to a series of new peaks, with TSMC accounting for nearly 45% of its weighting.\n“We expect 2026 to be another strong growth year for TSMC,” on expanding demand for the company’s most-advanced chipmaking technology and increased pricing, JPMorgan analyst Gokul Hariharan wrote in a note. “Gross margins should also see upside.”\nTSMC is set to report results for the December quarter next week. Analysts polled by Bloomberg expect sales rose 18% from a year ago, with its operating margin improving to a three-year high of over 50%.\nThe stock fell as much as 2.4% Wednesday, cooling off after a four-day rally that pushed TSMC’s market value to an all-time high of $1.4 trillion.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Curious Cult of Aldi\nZillow’s CEO Is Ready for Another Slow Year in the US Housing Market\nDutch Bros Is Out-Starbucksing Rivals With the Sugariest Drinks\nOzempic Users Actually Spend More Dining Out.

      "Content": "【財訊快報／陳孟朔】花旗集團(Citigroup)在最新發布的研報中預計，全球半導體三巨頭—台積電(2330)、三星電子(005930.KS)及英特爾(Intel，美股代碼INTC)即將公布的2026年資本支出指引將呈現積極態勢。這三大巨頭合計占花旗2026年全球晶圓廠設備(WFE)支出模型的59%，其投資動向被視為整體半導體設備產業鏈的重要風向標。花旗維持設備行業處於第二階段上行周期的判斷，並將2026年全球WFE支出預測由基準的1150億美元上調至樂觀情景下的1260億美元。台積電方面，花旗預計其將在1月15日的法說會上，將2026年資本支出指引設定在460億至480億美元區間，高於去年的400億至420億美元，且年內仍有進一步上調空間。該行模型預測台積電2026年資本支出約為470億美元，而市場部分樂觀預期甚至上看500億美元。這波擴產主要由2奈米(N2)製程加速爬坡、先進封裝產能缺口，以及全球多地同步建廠的需求所驅動。英特爾與三星則呈現不同的投資節奏。花旗料英特爾2026年資本支出將趨於穩定，預計約為150億至160億美元，主要受惠於代工業務(IFS)特別是後端封裝客戶管線的改善，使資本支出水平在經歷IDM 2.0轉型後進入企穩期。三星方面，花旗認為其存在顯著的上調空間，主因競爭對手美光(Micron)已將2026財年資本支出大幅提升至200億美元(年增45%)，為了在HBM與先進存儲市場維持競爭力，三星極可能追隨美光的擴產步伐。花旗分析師Atif Malik指出，更高的資本支出與更高的增長機遇密不可分。根據其基準模型，2026年NAND存儲設備支出預計增長30%，DRAM增長12%，而前端邏輯晶片則增長6%。隨著AI基礎設施從實驗室走向全面部署，晶片巨頭的持續擴產將為應用材料、艾司摩爾(ASML)及東京威力科創等設備供應商注入長期的強勁動能。",

EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nHe added that while Wang briefly became his boss following Meta's AI reorganization, he was not actively directing his work. He noted that people usually should not tell senior scientists like him how to conduct their work.\nMeta did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.\nMeta's $14 Billion AI Bet And Llama Fallout Wang's appointment followed Meta's $14 billion investment in Scale AI, part of Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive push to regain momentum in the AI race.\nLeCun said the move came after Zuckerberg grew frustrated with slow progress on Meta's flagship open-source model, Llama.\nAccording to LeCun, internal confidence eroded after Meta was criticized for allegedly overstating benchmark results tied to Llama 4. He said the controversy angered Zuckerberg and led him to sideline much of Meta's existing generative AI organization.\n\nHe said that \"a lot of people\" have already left Meta and those who haven't yet \"will leave.\"\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform Before the Raise Ends 1/19\nLLMs ‘A Dead End,' LeCun Says LeCun, who announced in November that he is leaving Meta to launch a new startup called Advanced Machine Intelligence , also reiterated his long-held belief that large language models are fundamentally limited .\nHe said people at Meta would like him not to call LLMs “a dead end,” but he will not change his mind just because others think he is wrong.\n\nHe said true artificial intelligence will require new architectures beyond LLMs, even if that view clashes with Meta's current priorities.\nSee Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nMeta Doubles Down On AI With Manus AI Acquisition In December, Meta ramped up its AI push by acquiring Manus AI , a fast-rising Chinese startup specializing in autonomous agents.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Manus deal adds to Meta's broader AI push this year, following its investment in Scale AI that valued the data-labeling company at $29 billion and pulled Wang into Meta's leadership circle.\nRead Next: Missed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs?

      "Content": "【財訊快報／陳孟朔】晶圓代工龍頭台積電(2330)(美股代碼TSM)ADR表現續強，在連續三天急漲22.67美元或7.57%後，週二再追高5.18美元或1.61%，收在327.43美元，寫下連續四天破頂紀錄。盤中最高漲3.36%至333.08美元的日高暨史上新高。這波漲勢主要受惠於市場對其先進製程領先地位的信心，以及即將於1月15日召開的法說會預期。法人分析，台積電近日強勁走勢背後有多項利多支撐。首先是技術面的重大突破，台積電已於官網宣布2奈米(N2)製程如期在2025年第四季正式啟動量產，並將於2026年進入產能快速爬坡階段，這使其在全球AI晶片與高效能運算(HPC)市場的壟斷地位更加穩固。此外，市場傳出台積電已與客戶達成共識，先進製程報價將於2026年元旦起生效，連續四年的漲價預期顯著提升長線獲利展望。針對即將到來的1月15日實體法說會，全球投資人聚焦四大核心指標：2026年資本支出指引、AI市場最新需求、2奈米量產初期良率，以及美、日、德海外廠的最新進度。市場普遍預期，台積電2026年資本支出將續創歷史新高，估計落在500億至550億美元區間。部分大型投行甚至樂觀預期，隨輝達(Nvidia)與超微(AMD)新平台陸續推出，台積電2026年全年每股盈餘(EPS)有望挑戰85元甚至更高水平。受ADR強勢帶動，台積電在台股市場同樣展現「一個人的武林」氣勢，引領加權指數在2026年開春即站穩3萬點大關。高盛與野村等外資近期相繼調升台積電目標價，最高甚至喊出2,400元。儘管短線漲幅已大，但在法說會利多預期與元月紅包行情支撐下，資金在法說會前夕提前卡位的跡象依舊明顯，短期內技術領先帶來的定價權優勢，仍是支撐股價持續創高的關鍵動能。",

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nKey Points There's a new autonomous driving AI model on the road.\nIt's being developed by a top name in AI hardware.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nAt the highly influential Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, one company unveiled a suite of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions designed to advance self-driving technology. Unfortunately, electric vehicle (EV) titan Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) wasn't that company. On fears that Tesla might be dented by such competition, investors sold out of its stock on Tuesday to leave it with a 4% loss in value.\n\nThe AI race heats up Delivering the keynote speech for CES 2026 on Monday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took the opportunity to introduce new AI offerings from his company. One of these was Alpamayo, described in the official Nvidia blog as \"an open reasoning model family for autonomous vehicle development,\" which is \"part of a sweeping push to bring AI into every domain.\"\nOne of the main occupants of the assisted/autonomous driving domain is, of course, Tesla. The company has leaned heavily into the technology, most recently with the release of its Full-Self-Driving (FSD) v14 software near the end of last year. Despite its name, FSD is an assisted driving system and not an autonomous one.\n\nAlpamayo and other AI solutions Nvidia is rolling out are open-source, so their development should be relatively quick.\nAI in the fast lane Chip maker Nvidia is the near-undisputed king of AI processors, and as a developer of cutting-edge AI driving solutions, it will be a formidable competitor in that segment as well. This presents a big challenge for Tesla, which has made AI and robotics core components of its business strategy. Nvidia poses a significant threat in the former, then, and investors are right to be concerned about this.\n\nWe just issued 'double down' alerts on 3 stocks — find out if Tesla made our list Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $487,932 !*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $50,843 !*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $493,290 !*\n\nStory Continues\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee the 3 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 5, 2026\nEric Volkman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "Tower Semiconductor (NasdaqGS:TSEM) is back in focus after announcing a collaboration with LightIC Technologies that applies its silicon photonics platform to next generation FMCW LiDAR for automotive and Physical AI uses.\nSee our latest analysis for Tower Semiconductor.\nThe collaboration with LightIC arrives after a strong period for the stock, with a 90 day share price return of 60.85% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 130.33%, suggesting momentum has been building despite a modest 1 month share price return of 4.63% and recent short term weakness.\n\nIf this kind of silicon photonics and LiDAR story has your attention, it could be worth seeing what else is out there in high growth tech and AI stocks for more ideas.\nWith the shares up strongly over 1 year and the stock now trading only about 8% below the US$129 analyst price target, the key question is whether Tower is still mispriced or if the market is already factoring in expectations for future growth.\nMost Popular Narrative: 7.5% Undervalued With Tower Semiconductor’s fair value in the narrative set at US$129 against a last close of US$119.29, the gap is modest but meaningful for valuation-focused investors.\nRead the complete narrative.\nWant to see why this narrative arrives at a higher fair value than the past analyst target range? The story reflects stronger revenue compounding, margin expansion, and a forward earnings multiple that assumes Tower’s specialty platforms continue to scale. Curious which assumptions have the biggest impact on that US$129 figure, and how sensitive the outcome is to them? Read on to see how the numbers connect.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $129 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this depends on heavy CapEx plans and concentrated exposure to SiPho and SiGe, where weaker demand or faster technology shifts could quickly undermine those valuation assumptions.\nFind out about the key risks to this Tower Semiconductor narrative.\nAnother View: Rich Multiples Keep The Bar High That 7.5% undervaluation in the narrative sits awkwardly next to Tower Semiconductor’s current P/E of 68.5x, compared with 37.3x for the US semiconductor industry and 44.3x for peers, and a fair ratio of 45.7x. In plain terms, the market is already paying a premium, so it is reasonable to ask how much upside is really left if sentiment cools or expectations reset.\n\nStory Continues\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own Tower Semiconductor Narrative If you look at these numbers and reach a different conclusion, or just prefer to test your own assumptions, you can build a custom view in minutes with Do it your way .\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 1 key reward investors are optimistic about regarding Tower Semiconductor.\nLooking for more investment ideas?

      "Content": "Microsoft (MSFT) is back in focus for investors after recent trading, with the share price around $472.85 and short term returns across the week, month, and past 3 months all showing declines.\nSee our latest analysis for Microsoft.\nThat recent weak share price momentum, with the 90 day share price return down 9.91% and year to date share price return roughly flat, contrasts with a 12.78% 1 year total shareholder return and stronger multi year gains. This may hint at investors reassessing near term growth expectations or risk while the longer term story remains intact.\n\nIf Microsoft’s recent pullback has you rethinking your tech exposure, it could be a good moment to see what else is available among high growth tech and AI stocks .\nWith the share price pulling back while Microsoft reports revenue of about $293.8b, net income of roughly $104.9b, and an intrinsic discount of 21.59%, investors may ask whether there is still a buying opportunity or whether potential future growth is already reflected in the current price.\nMost Popular Narrative: 12.6% Overvalued According to PicaCoder, the narrative fair value of about $420 sits below Microsoft’s last close at $472.85, which sets up a more cautious valuation story.\nBy alienating its consumer base, failing to secure AI dominance, and engaging in reckless capital spending, Microsoft is effectively scuttling the differentiation that fuels its enterprise dominance. The central thesis is alarming: Microsoft is building a future where its costs are skyrocketing, its products are losing their competitive edge, and its own technology is actively shrinking its addressable market.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how this leads to a lower fair value than today’s price? The narrative leans on pressured margins, rich future earnings multiples, and ambitious revenue assumptions. It is the combination that matters.\nResult: Fair Value of $420 (OVERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this bearish narrative could be challenged if Microsoft’s AI products gain broader adoption at attractive economics, or if heavy datacenter spending leads to stronger long term returns.\nFind out about the key risks to this Microsoft narrative.\nAnother View: DCF Points the Other Way That bearish narrative pegs fair value at US$420 and calls Microsoft overvalued, but our DCF model tells a different story. With fair value at roughly US$603, the current US$472.85 price screens as about 21.6% below that level. Which story do you think fits your own expectations better?\n\nStory continues\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nBuild Your Own Microsoft Narrative If you look at the numbers and come to a different conclusion, or simply prefer to shape your own view, you can build a full Microsoft story in just a few minutes with Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Microsoft research is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards and 1 important warning sign that could impact your investment decision.\n\nLooking for more investment ideas? If you stop with just one company, you could miss other opportunities that fit your style, so use the Simply Wall St Screener to widen your options confidently.\nSpot potential value by checking out these 881 undervalued stocks based on cash flows that may offer more appealing price tags relative to their cash flows.\nCatch the next wave of AI adoption early by scanning these 25 AI penny stocks that focus on artificial intelligence themes.\nLock in potential income ideas by reviewing these 13 dividend stocks with yields > 3% that currently offer yields above 3%.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

It's obviously a huge shift in computing, but it's much more for in our vision than than just a chatbot in your pocket or your purse. It's really about delivering a truly helpful digital assistant that can be with you and help you get things done. Uh and so in 2025 was an incredibly transformative year. Uh obviously, we had some big breakthroughs in our model technology, right? And that led to some really big improvements in our products. Um obviously search and the Gemini application are getting better, but\n00:30 Speaker A\nAndroid is taking advantage of all of that technology as well. So a couple examples that I that I thought would be useful to share. Uh one is that on an Android Android users are 58% more likely to say that they have not received a spam or a scam call in the last month than the other operating system. And that's because we're using the best of Google's AI models to help screen out all of that that those those those bad guys. Um and that's moving now from AI demos and AI technology to AI utility.\n01:05 Speaker B\nLike real world application.\n01:06 Speaker A\nRight. And I think that's what everyone wants to see. And another great thing that happened in 2025 for Android is we really scaled the access to Gemini across all the different touch points in your life. So, not just on your phone, but also your watch, your TV, your car, um and uh and and many other uh points where consumers can just interact with their digital assistant in natural ways.\n01:35 Speaker B\nIs is the idea here that, you know, we we've all kind of had accounts uh that go across devices is there's there's been, you know, good versions of that, bad versions of that. Is is this really kind of supposed to be the ultimate, okay, you take your your all of your information with you, everything that that that, you know, your your Google account has and just travel across your various devices having that kind of unique kind of experience that Gemini has to offer in in all of those places. Is that is that kind of where where this all goes?\n02:18 Speaker A\nWell, I think we think about it from a from the consumer standpoint. Uh when if you have a digital assistant, and that that is the vision is to create a truly helpful digital assistant, uh you would want that assistant to be able to be accessible in all the different parts of your life where it could be useful. And, you know, computing is in many different parts of our life now. We have our phone in our pocket or our purse, so that's one. But you also might be out for a run where you've got just your watch with you. Um you also might be in your living room with your family and you might want to access some information right from your TV and continue your conversation from where you left off from before, um not have to start over. Um and of course, if you're like me and you have a long commute, you may want to use some of that time in the car to either learn something or get some get some things done with your assistant, um or just figure out where a great place to stop is on that road trip, you know, on the way. And it should know about your likes and dislikes and understand that you were researching last night um where the kids might enjoy taking a 20 or 30-minute break. Uh and all of that should come together across all the different form factors in your life in a really seamless way. And that's what Android can bring.",

      "Content": "JCI\n\nMOD\n\nIn a possible red flag for the artificial intelligence investment boom , the stocks of companies that provide cooling systems for data centers, plunged Tuesday after Nvidia unveiled more efficient chips.\nShares of Johnson Controls slid 6.2%, while shares of Modine Manufacturing plunged more than 7.4%. Trane’s stock fell 4%, and Carrier Global’s also dipped nearly 1%.\n\nAll of those companies sell industrial cooling systems to sprawling data centers, which tech companies are spending tens of billions of dollars to build and expand around the world as part of the AI investment wave.\nNvidia’s chips are a major driver of the AI revolution. CEO Jensen Huang told attendees at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that the company’s next-generation Vera Rubin chips will not require chiller systems to cool the water that keeps the high-powered AI chips at an appropriate operating temperature.\n“The power of Vera Rubin is twice as high as Grace Blackwell,” Huang said, referring to the current Blackwell generation of Nvidia chips. “And yet, and this is the miracle, the air that goes into it — the airflow is about the same — and the water that goes into it ... is 45 degrees Celsius.”\n\nAt that temperature, “no water chillers are necessary for data centers,” he added. “We are basically cooling this supercomputer with hot water; it is so incredibly efficient.” Forty-five degrees Celsius is the equivalent of 113 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe new Nvidia chips could scramble plans for projects that come with major price tags.\nChatGPT producer OpenAI alone has said it aims to build $1.4 trillion worth of computing capacity. Microsoft, one of OpenAI’s most critical data center partners, said in October that it plans to increase its AI computing capacity by 80% over the coming year “and roughly double our total datacenter footprint over the next two years.”\nThose data centers, which have triggered controversy over their water and electricity use , require high-powered chillers to keep the equipment inside cool enough to keep running.\n\nChillers are so critical to data centers that in November, when the devices were accidentally knocked offline at a facility used by the trading giant CME Group, temperatures inside the data center rose too much, leading to an equipment shutdown. Systems that normally process trillions of dollars’ worth of trades in commodities and futures markets for investors from London to Hong Kong were halted for 10 hours until the cooling system could be restored.\nSome industry analysts see Huang’s announcement as a potential worry for companies that have been involved with building data centers and the cooling systems they require.\n\nStory Continues\n“We believe the comments create some questions/concerns,” analysts at the investment firm Baird wrote Tuesday.\n“We don’t see a big risk to near-term estimates, but expect news to create some incremental concerns around orders, especially later in 2026,” they wrote.\nNvidia said Monday that the next-generation Vera Rubin chips would be available for customers in the second half of 2026.\n\n“Unsurprisingly, data centers have been a substantial area of growth for HVAC companies,” the Baird analysts wrote. Cooling companies have seen data centers as “a source of strong revenue/order activity over the past 12-18 months, benefitting not only from strong data center demand, but also greater cooling density requirements.”\nNot everyone is convinced it’s a warning sign, though.\n“While we understand investor concern around the end market dynamics, we view the HVAC sell-off activity ... as overdone,” Citigroup industrials analyst Andrew Kaplowitz wrote to clients, noting that the architecture of the Rubin chips “still requires liquid cooling capabilities.”\nIndeed, data center infrastructure provider Vertiv Holdings shares closed fractionally higher after having fallen more than 7%. And despite Tuesday’s moves lower, Johnson Controls has still gained more than 45% over the last year.\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

      "Content": "RSM US LLP has previously rolled out an AI-powered adverse event reporting platform in Hawai‘i, built on Microsoft Azure, Azure SQL, Azure AI Foundry, Power BI and other Microsoft Data & AI tools to monitor healthcare risks in near real time across roughly 3,600 participants.\nThis deployment, alongside Azure’s use in power-grid digital twins and large-scale grid operations, underscores how Microsoft’s AI cloud is increasingly embedded in critical infrastructure where reliability, compliance and data integration are central requirements.\nWe’ll now examine how Microsoft’s growing role in AI for healthcare and power grids may influence its cloud-led investment narrative.\n\nRare earth metals are an input to most high-tech devices, military and defence systems and electric vehicles. The global race is on to secure supply of these critical minerals. Beat the pack to uncover the 39 best rare earth metal stocks of the very few that mine this essential strategic resource.\nMicrosoft Investment Narrative Recap To own Microsoft today, you need to believe its cloud and AI stack can keep converting large, mission critical workloads into durable, high margin software revenue while heavy data center CapEx remains manageable. The Hawai‘i adverse event platform and Azure’s growing role in power grid operations reinforce Azure’s relevance in regulated, infrastructure-grade use cases, but they do not materially change the near term focus on AI monetization as the key catalyst or CapEx and margin pressure as the main risk.\n\nAmong recent developments, Microsoft’s acquisition of Osmos to bolster Fabric’s data automation fits directly beside the RSM and grid digital twin deployments, since all depend on moving and analyzing sensitive data reliably at scale. Together, these announcements highlight how Microsoft is trying to deepen its role in end to end AI data pipelines, which could support its cloud driven growth narrative if customers continue expanding workloads onto Azure and related services.\nYet beneath this strong AI story, investors should be aware that Microsoft’s elevated CapEx for AI data centers could pressure margins and cash generation if...\nRead the full narrative on Microsoft (it's free!)\nMicrosoft's narrative projects $425.0 billion revenue and $158.4 billion earnings by 2028.\n\nUncover how Microsoft's forecasts yield a $624.45 fair value , a 32% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Fair value estimates from 122 Simply Wall St Community members span roughly US$360 to US$624 per share, reflecting a wide range of expectations about Microsoft’s earnings power.

      "Content": "Samsung Tech Forum series continues at CES 2026 with industry leaders convening to explore the evolution of streaming\nLAS VEGAS , Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. yesterday held \"FAST Forward: How New Streaming Models Are Shaping the Next Generation of TV\" as part of its Tech Forum panel series at CES 2026. Taking place at The Wynn in Las Vegas, Nevada, the panel brought together leaders from entertainment and media to explore the evolution of streaming and the rapid rise of free-ad-supported television (FAST).\n\nThe session highlighted the interconnected relationship between today's rapidly evolving consumer behaviors and preferences, the transformation of content by technology and monetization models, the expanding role of creators as studios and the ways in which interactive and live experiences are catalyzing a shift from passive viewing into active engagement.\n\nModerated by Natalie Jarvey of The Ankler, the panel featured Salek Brodsky, SVP and Global Head of Samsung TV Plus; Alessandra Catanese, CEO of Smosh and Bruce Casino, EVP, Sales & Distribution, U.S., NBCUniversal Global TV Distribution.\nFAST Gains Momentum as Audiences Recalibrate Value\nAs audiences grapple with subscription fatigue and a fragmented streaming landscape, the panel focused on how FAST is restoring simplicity and value to television. Samsung TV Plus anchored the conversation as a platform designed to reduce friction, offering hundreds of live and on-demand channels in one free, easily accessible experience across Samsung TVs and devices worldwide.\n\"The TV experience today can often feel like too much work for the viewer,\" said SVP Brodsky. \"Our goal with Samsung TV Plus is to simplify television again and combine the power of linear discovery with a modern, connected experience that feels effortless, curated and truly valuable.\"\n\nThe panelists emphasized that FAST has evolved into a core part of the streaming ecosystem, complementing subscription and traditional models while delivering premium, proven programming at scale. For Samsung TV Plus, that evolution is rooted in shared experiences that elevate viewing and meet users not just where they already are, but where they want to be.\nHybrid Models Redefine the Streaming Ecosystem\nPanelists emphasized that the evolution of streaming is less about replacing traditional models and more about expanding how audiences engage with content. FAST, subscription and linear distribution models are increasingly working in tandem, allowing studios to extend the life of proven franchises, reach new viewers and unlock additional value without sacrificing performance elsewhere. By leveraging data, audience behavior and decades of content insight, media companies are deploying FAST to complement existing channels and create a more resilient and diversified ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nEVP Bruce Casino highlighted how this approach has enabled NBCUniversal to bring both classic and contemporary content to FAST audiences while continuing to see strong performance across platforms. \"FAST doesn't replace traditional distribution, it extends it,\" said Casino. \"What we're seeing is that when great content shows up in multiple places, it creates incremental value rather than cannibalization — allowing franchises to thrive across FAST, streaming and linear channels.\"\n\nCreators Emerge as the New Studios\nThe panel also examined how the changing nature of consumer habits and television platforms means content creators do not have to work exclusively with legacy studios to reach a broad audience. As this medium expands from social platforms to the living room, FAST is helping bridge digital culture and traditional TV, while also serving to elevate its production quality.\nSamsung TV Plus was highlighted as a platform that helps creators evolve from digital-first brands into full-fledged television studios, helping expand reach, unlock new monetization opportunities and introduce content to broader, global audiences.\nOne of the clearest examples of a brand that has taken the step from digital-first brand to legitimate TV studio is sketch comedy-improv collective Smosh. By launching a FAST channel with Samsung TV Plus, Smosh has been able to strengthen its connection with its already-dedicated fans while gaining access to a much larger viewer base. Due to this evolution, Smosh has enhanced long-term growth.\n\n\"Partnering with Samsung TV Plus allowed us to elevate our production quality and invest in the future of the Smosh brand,\" said CEO Alessandra Catanese. \"It was the right platform to help us reach a broader audience while positioning our content in a premium environment that supports where we're headed as a company.\"\nLive and Interactive Experiences Drive Engagement\nLooking beyond on-demand viewing, panelists discussed how live programming like concerts and interactivity are reshaping the television experience by creating shared moments that audiences actively participate in.\nWith features such as synchronized premieres and real-time participation, technology is transforming television from a passive activity into an interactive experience — fostering connection, excitement and a sense of belonging that brings viewers together organically.Together, the panelists agreed that the future of television will be defined by flexibility, cultural connection and experiences that invite participation, not just consumption.\n\n\"Authentic content that creates cultural connection and brings people together is what matters most,\" said SVP Brodsky. \"That's why we're investing in live events, creator programming and interactive formats that remind people why TV has always been the center of the home.\"\nAs streaming continues to evolve, Samsung is focused on helping shape a TV ecosystem that delivers value for viewers, opportunity for creators and scale for advertisers, — redefining what television can be in 2026 and beyond.\nAbout Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nSamsung inspires the world and shapes the future with transformative ideas and technologies. The company is redefining the worlds of TVs, digital signage, smartphones, wearables, tablets, home appliances and network systems, as well as memory, system LSI and foundry.

      "Content": "GM\n\nAs Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) shares continue to soar, former fund manager George Noble says that its valuations are fundamentally disconnected from reality, even after considering its ambitious robotaxis and Optimus humanoid robots.\nTesla Shares Significantly Overvalued Noble, who ran Fidelity’s Overseas Fund, outlined Tesla’s “sum of the parts valuation,” considering its various products and segments, before comparing each of them with the valuations of peers and competitors, on Sunday, in a post on X.\nStarting with robotics, Noble compared Tesla's Optimus project with established and emerging competitors. “Boston Dynamics is estimated to be worth $5B. Figure AI recently raised money at a valuation of $39B,” he said, while adding that “both are far ahead of $TSLA in the development of robots.”\n\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla?

      "Content": "NVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nSTX\n\nWDC\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Sandisk Corp. shares jumped 28% Tuesday, their best performance since February, after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang highlighted the need for memory and storage in comments at the CES tech conference.\nThe stock is on a tear, leaping more than 47% in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring 1,080% since hitting a low on April 22. It was the best performer in the S&P 500 Index Tuesday, followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, both of which posted double-digit percentage gains.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\n“For storage, that is a completely unserved market today,” Huang said at CES Monday. “This is a market that never existed, and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world’s AIs.”\nTight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Jake Silverman. Huang’s comments at CES “suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems,” he said.\n\nMemory prices have been steadily climbing. Earlier this week, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60% to 70% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year.\nSandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as “key beneficiaries” of the push for “AI inferencing and AI at the edge” in 2026, Bank of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 4. Mohan expects organizations to retain increasing amounts of data for training, analytics and compliance purposes, with demand for storage “skyrocketing in tandem.” In particular, he cited growing use in drones, surveillance, vehicles and sports technology.\n“The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models, that has created the next wave in hardware spending,” Mohan wrote. “As we look at 2026 and beyond, we expect AI Inference to dominate.”\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Curious Cult of Aldi\nZillow’s CEO Is Ready for Another Slow Year in the US Housing Market\nDutch Bros Is Out-Starbucksing Rivals With the Sugariest Drinks\nOzempic Users Actually Spend More Dining Out.

Big themes are already coming into focus from how quickly AI is moving into consumer hardware to what tech leaders are saying about spending, innovation and the year ahead. Join me now from the event in Las Vegas, got Yahoo Finance Tech Editor, Dan Howley. Dan?\n00:23 Dan Howley\nThat's right Josh, I'm actually here at NVIDIA's space at the Fountain Blue Hotel uh in Las Vegas and right behind me are the company's new server racks. We have the Vera Rubin uh as well as the prior generation, that's the Blackwell Ultra server rack. So, I mean they're everything here that they announced is on display and you know, NVIDIA kind of sucked all the air out of the room last year at CES, basically just dominating the conversation. Seemingly doing it again here, although they do have some challenges. We also saw uh AMD's Lisa Su take the stage to keynote CES's first big day. She announced the company's latest Helios rack scale system. That's the first system that's meant to go head-to-head with NVIDIA's big boys back here. Uh the first from AMD. They also gave more details on the company's next generation GPU for data centers. That's that MI 500 series. So, a little more kind of razzle-dazzle from from AMD. We also saw Intel, uh basically saying that they're about to launch their next generation Panther Lake chip they call the Core Ultra Series 3, which I got to see in person with some basic demos, things along those lines. I really do feel as though it's going to be a big deal for Intel when it launches just because of the sheer capability that has to offer, but we'll have to see how that really looks for PCs and then what that means for for sales going forward. It's all part of that turnaround effort. But, you know, a lot of larger themes here. Uh AI obviously the discussion we're here at NVIDIA, AMD AI, Intel AI. Basically everywhere you look AI is just kind of plastered on everything. I'm not even going to lie. I saw a a goofy little robot uh oven where you kind of scoop up ingredients and kind of drop them into little slots like a uh, I guess, toaster and then it'll cook for you. Didn't look very appetizing, when it was done and finished, it it looked kind of good. Uh but it it's CES, there's going to be all sorts of weird stuff. I think the the main thing here though is those chips, those robots and that AI.\n01:52 Josh\nYeah, those robots, Dan, you know, certainly a theme. I think I saw a couple on stage there with Jensen Huang, kind of actually stole the show actually. Uh I'm just wondering what what have we learned about that theme specifically, Dan?\n02:11 Dan Howley\nYeah, I think that when it comes to the the robotics, it really is going to be something that companies continue to push forward. Now it doesn't necessarily mean that it's here yet. Uh those little Star Wars guys are very cute. They hung out for a while during Jensen's keynote. Uh there's a robot walking around here with a cowboy hat on. Uh there's one that's doing kind of explaining how it would do surgery. Um there's a robot uh at Intel's booth where they basically say, hey, you know, this company, uh it's it's for physical therapy, things along those lines. They were running NVIDIA's chips on board locally on that robot. Now they're running Intel. So Intel getting into that space. Uh AMD showed off a new robot uh as well that's running on its own hardware. And you just see them kind of all over the place when it comes to uh CES. I think again, this isn't something that's going to happen overnight. It's still something that is definitely in uh heavy industrial settings. We had Hyundai uh and Boston Dynamics talk about how they're going to be bringing the production scale Atlas robot into Hyundai facilities to perform different tasks and eventually scale that up. Uh Hyundai talking about how they're going to have kind of a mass production scale of different robots uh in 2028. And so it's something that's coming, but I I don't necessarily think that you'll be able to wake up and have Rosie the robot, you know, doing chores around the house for you at this point. It's still very much an industrial level uh application.\n03:13 Dan Howley\nIf I can get something to fold my laundry, God, I would take it right away.\n03:17 Josh\nDan, appreciate all the great reporting, my friend, as always. Thank you.",

      "Content": "NVIDIA’s recent performance snapshot NVIDIA (NVDA) continues to draw attention from investors, with the stock recently closing at $188.12. Short term returns are mixed, with a 1 day decline, flat year to date, and modest gains over the past month.\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA.\nRecent share price moves for NVIDIA have been relatively muted over shorter periods, while the 1 year and multi year total shareholder returns remain very strong. This suggests momentum has cooled compared with previous years, but long term holders have still seen substantial gains.\n\nIf NVIDIA’s recent share price pause has you thinking about where else growth stories might emerge, it could be a good time to look at high growth tech and AI stocks .\nSo with NVIDIA’s strong multi year returns, solid recent revenue and net income growth of around 26%, and a share price sitting below analyst price targets, is this a fresh opportunity, or is the market already pricing in future growth?\nMost Popular Narrative: 45.5% Undervalued According to RobertoAllende, the narrative fair value of US$345.07 sits well above NVIDIA’s last close of US$188.12, framing a sizeable valuation gap.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how this narrative reaches a much higher fair value than today’s price? It leans on huge data center revenue, chunky margins, and a future earnings multiple that assumes strong profitability ahead. The full narrative spells out how those ingredients fit together.\nResult: Fair Value of $345.07 (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this narrative can still break if hyperscalers slow AI infrastructure spending, or if rivals and custom chips start to squeeze NVIDIA’s pricing power and margins.\nFind out about the key risks to this NVIDIA narrative.\nAnother angle on valuation That user narrative points to a fair value of US$345.07, which lines up with very strong growth assumptions. Our SWS DCF model takes a different view, with a fair value estimate of US$161.14, which would make NVIDIA look overvalued at the current US$188.12. So which story feels more realistic to you?\n\nStory Continues\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nBuild Your Own NVIDIA Narrative If you are not fully on board with these views or just prefer to run the numbers yourself, you can build a custom take in minutes with Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your NVIDIA research is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards and 2 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\n\nLooking for more investment ideas?

      "Content": "MSFT\n\nAMD\n\nNvidia NVDA and AMD AMD have already made a clear argument regarding which stocks may be the best AI investments for 2026 at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which is taking place in Las Vegas from January 6-9.\nAs one of the world’s largest and most influential technology events, Nvidia and AMD have taken the spotlight as companies unveil their newest products, platforms, and breakthroughs.\n\nNvidia Launches Vera Rubin Nvidia officially launched Vera Rubin, its next major AI computing platform that is already in full production and rolling out to its partners later in the year.\nNamed after the pioneering astronomer who discovered evidence of dark matter, Vera Rubin symbolizes Nvidia’s ambition to \"illuminate\" new frontiers as the platform is engineered for the next wave of AI workloads that demand unprecedented context length and compute power.\n\nVera Rubin includes six new chips, including the Vera Rubin superchip, which combines computer processing units (CPUs) and graphic processing units (GPUs) into one AI engine that is ideal for Agentic AI, advanced reasoning models, Mixture of experts (MoE) architectures, and large-context inference.\nPositioned as the backbone for data-center scale AI, it’s noteworthy that Microsoft MSFT will be using the Vera Rubin superchip for its next-generation AI super factories.\n\nAMD’s Helios & Ryzen AI Platforms AMD also launched new AI platforms with the marketing strategy of “AI Everywhere”, spanning edge devices to massive data centers.\nMarketed as the “world's best AI system”, AMD announced the launch of its Helios platform, a direct challenger to Nvidia’s Vera Rubin platform. Aimed at yotta-scale AI infrastructure and large-model building, Helios is built around AMD’s Instinct MI455X GPUs and its EPYC “Venice” CPUs.\n\nAMD expanded its PC and edge portfolio with its new Ryzen AI 400 / PRO 400 Series processors. Additionally, AMD unveiled Ryzen Halo, a mini PC developer platform designed to compete with Nvidia’s DGX Spark, while also introducing its Ryzen AI Embedded P100/X100 processors for automotive, industrial, and robotics applications.\n\nPerformance & P/E Valuation Comparison AMD’s returns of +200% in the last three years have paled in comparison to Nvidia's stock, which has skyrocketed more than 1,100% during this period. That said, AMD’s expansion across the AI ecosystem led to its stock spiking over +70% in 2025 to outperform Nvidia's gains of nearly 40%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAt current levels, AMD’s forward earnings multiple of 35X is a slight discount to Nvidia’s 40X. Still, both are trading at nice discounts compared to their P/E valuations in years past and have edged closer to the benchmark S&P 500’s 23X.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMD & NVDA EPS Revisions In the last 60 days, EPS revisions for AMD have been flat for fiscal 2025 and FY26. AMD is thought to have rounded out 2025 with annual earnings rising 19% to $3.96 per share, and FY26 EPS is projected to increase another 58% to $6.26. Notably, AMD will be reporting its Q4 2025 results on February 3.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPivoting to Nvidia, EPS estimates for its current fiscal 2026 have risen over 4% in the last two months with FY27 EPS revisions up 16%. Nvidia’s EPS is now expected to soar 56% to $4.66 versus $2.99 per share in its FY25. Plus, FY27 projections call for EPS growth of 55% to $7.24 per share. Nvidia will be reporting its Q4 2026 results on February 25.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line Their presentations at the 2026 CES could lift the appealing outlook for AMD and Nvidia after revealing next-gen AI platforms.\nFor now, the trend of EPS revisions favors more upside for Nvidia stock, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Following an extensive rally in 2025, AMD stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as the chipmaker's growth and AI expansion are mesmerizing, but still a second fiddle to Nvidia.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after a broader market rally drove investor optimism in artificial intelligence and big tech stocks.\nThe S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all pushed higher, approaching record levels set late last year. Much of the positive momentum was linked to the technology sector, with a particular focus on companies advancing artificial intelligence, a key theme at the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas.

The move was part of a wider \"risk-on\" appetite that saw the Nasdaq Composite surge early in the session. Investors rotated back into high-growth tech stocks, with the semiconductor industry appearing poised to anchor the market's trajectory. Market analysts noted that the bullish themes from the previous year, particularly around AI and tech, were carrying forward into the new year. This sentiment was supported by the view that the chipmaking industry would remain supply-constrained as companies continued to build out the new infrastructure required for AI.\n\nStory Continues\nVishay Intertechnology is up 7.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $16.49 per share, it is still trading 13.7% below its 52-week high of $19.10 from February 2025.

The market came to realize that the growth in AI was not just a computing issue, but also a significant storage problem. Western Digital benefited from this trend, particularly after separating its Hard Disk Drive (HDD) business to focus on storage for large cloud providers.

      "Content": "SIEGY\n\nNVDA\n\nAt CES 2026, PepsiCo announced a multi-year collaboration with Siemens and NVIDIA to deploy physics-based digital twins and AI across its plants and supply chain, after early U.S. pilots showed faster design cycles and lower capital spending needs.\nThis move positions PepsiCo as an early large-scale adopter of industrial metaverse tools in consumer packaged goods, using high-fidelity 3D simulations to test facility changes virtually and identify most operational issues before they occur on the factory floor.\nNext, we’ll examine how PepsiCo’s use of Siemens’ Digital Twin Composer and NVIDIA Omniverse could reshape its technology-driven investment narrative.\n\nThe end of cancer? These 29 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.\nPepsiCo Investment Narrative Recap To own PepsiCo, you need to believe its global snacks and beverages franchises, supported by consistent dividends, can justify a premium valuation despite modest growth and high debt. The new Siemens and NVIDIA collaboration strengthens its cost and efficiency story, but the biggest near term swing factor still looks like execution on broader North America cost cuts, including SKU reductions, which carries some risk if it crimps future growth capacity.\n\nThe digital twin announcement fits alongside PepsiCo’s earlier plan to increase automation and digital tools across its North America supply chain after discussions with Elliott Investment Management. Together, these efforts frame a clearer near term catalyst around productivity and core operating margin expansion, even as the company balances those initiatives against the risk of cutting too deeply into its product and manufacturing base.\nYet investors should also be aware that productivity gains can come at a cost if PepsiCo trims capacity too aggressively...\nRead the full narrative on PepsiCo (it's free!)\nPepsiCo's narrative projects $101.5 billion revenue and $11.8 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 3.4% yearly revenue growth and about a $4.2 billion earnings increase from $7.6 billion today.\n\nUncover how PepsiCo's forecasts yield a $155.91 fair value , a 11% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Simply Wall St Community members have posted 42 fair value estimates for PepsiCo stock, ranging widely from US$116 to about US$247 per share. You can weigh those views against the tension between PepsiCo’s efficiency push and the risk that cost cuts and automation initiatives constrain its ability to respond to shifting consumer preferences over time.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 42 other fair value estimates on PepsiCo - why the stock might be worth as much as 76% more than the current price!\nBuild Your Own PepsiCo Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nHe cited an intraday explosion in data center stocks on the first trading day of January as evidence that institutional buying pressure is already returning to this sector.\nTop Picks For Earnings Season Navellier is positioning his portfolio ahead of what he calls “judgment day” for corporate earnings. He argues that data center demand and AI implementation will drive significant growth for specific companies.\nHis top pick remains Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), his largest holding, which he expects to report a 66.7% increase in sales and a 71% jump in earnings, buoyed by new chip sales to China.\n\nBeyond Nvidia, Navellier is bullish on Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR ) for its role as a top “AI implementer” for government contracts, forecasting a 64.1% earnings surge.\nHe also highlighted Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: STX ) and Celestica Inc. (NYSE: CLS ) as beneficiaries of the data center boom, with earnings forecasted to rise 37.6% and 58.1%, respectively.\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform Before the Raise Ends 1/19\nMacro Outlook: Deflation Is The Risk Navellier's focus on quality is underscored by his concern over the broader economy.

      "Content": "Key Points Broadcom's customizable AI chips are experiencing strong demand.\nThese ASICs (also called \"XPUs\") offer significant energy savings for AI processing.\nNew customer additions could drive the stock even higher in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nShares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) surged in 2025, gaining 49% for the year. Like many of its peers in the semiconductor and technology spaces, the company has become a key player in the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) . It is widely regarded as an industry leader in custom Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial to the success of high-speed computing, hyperscale data center operations, and the proliferation of AI.\nLet's take a look back at what drove Broadcom's success in 2025 and why its winning streak will likely continue.\nRobust growth Power consumption has become a growing concern in AI circles, and companies deploying the technology are looking for ways to reduce costs. Graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the necessary computational horsepower, but there's a trade-off, as these high-end chips are power-hungry.\nThose seeking to conserve energy are increasingly turning to Broadcom's ASICs to meet that need, which is evident in the company's financial results. Last year, Broadcom's revenue grew 24% year over year to a record $64 billion, but that tells only part of the story. AI revenue surged 65% to $20 billion, fueling record semiconductor revenue.\n\nThat growth streak will likely continue. On the fourth-quarter earnings call, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan laid out expectations for the coming year, stating, \"We see the spending momentum by our customers for AI continuing to accelerate in 2026.\" To that end, the company is guiding for first quarter revenue growth of 28%, fueled by AI semiconductor revenue, which is expected to grow roughly 100%.\nAdd to that Broadcom's $73 billion backlog, and the growing opportunity begins to come into focus.\nThe road ahead Looking further ahead, Tan previously stated Broadcom's AI opportunity was between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027 -- and that estimate only included the company's three existing hyperscale customers, widely believed to be Alphabet , Meta Platforms , and TikTok parent ByteDance.\nSince then, AI start-up Anthropic has placed a $10 billion order, and Broadcom has inked a multi-billion-dollar, four-year deal to provide 10 gigawatts of its custom ASICs to OpenAI. These new agreements suggest the company's previous long-term outlook might be conservative.\n\nStory Continues\nIn fact, analysts' consensus estimates predict that Broadcom's revenue growth will increase by 52% in 2026 and by another 37% in 2027. Wall Street's average price target for the stock is $457, suggesting potential upside of 33% for investors over the coming year compared to Monday's closing price.\n\nThere's been some concern about a bubble in AI stocks, but the majority of investors plan to stay the course in 2026, according to The Motley Fool's 2026 AI Investor Outlook Report. The report found that nine of 10 AI investors plan to hold or even buy more AI stocks over the coming year, \"This suggests that individual investors are buying into AI's potential for long-term growth even amid short-term volatility,\" according to the report. As such, Broadcom is well-positioned to benefit from those tailwinds.\nMoreover, Broadcom stock is trading for less than 25 times next year's expected earnings, which is an attractive price for a company with such a compelling opportunity ahead.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "JCI\n\nMOD\n\nTT\n\nCARR\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Makers of cooling systems saw their stocks plunge on Tuesday after comments by Nvidia Corp.’s chief executive raised fears about demand for their products from data centers.\nJohnson Controls International Plc, which makes water-cooled chillers and similar systems, tumbled as much as 11% in the worst intraday drop since 2022. Modine Manufacturing Co. fell as much as 21% before paring declines, and Trane Technologies Plc and Carrier Global Corp. also slid Tuesday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\nIt’s possible to cool racks with Nvidia’s next-generation Rubin chips using water at a temperature that does not require a water chiller, the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, said at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. Chillers are a “predominant” piece of the equipment that companies like Trane and Johnson Controls provide to data centers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n“The comments create some questions/concerns about the longer-term positioning of chillers within data centers over time, particularly as liquid cooling becomes more prominent,” Baird analyst Timothy Wojs wrote in a note to clients. Liquid cooling allows systems to operate at higher temperatures, he added.\nWhile Wojs does not see a big risk to the cooling companies’ near-term estimates, he expects the “news to create some incremental concerns around orders, especially later in 2026.”\nHungry for exposure to an artificial intelligence boom, investors last year piled into shares of companies making the equipment that keep racks of AI chips from overheating. Johnson Controls stock surged 52% in 2025, and Vertiv Holdings Co., which makes both cooling systems and power equipment, advanced 43%. Weakness in the residential HVAC market weighed on shares of other players, such as Trane and Carrier.\n\nHuang’s comments at CES also sparked the latest leg of a rally in data-storage stocks, another group caught up in enthusiasm about AI. Sandisk Corp. rose 23%, the best performance in the S&P 500 Index, after the CEO highlighted the need for memory and storage. The stock has now soared more than 1,000% from an April low.\n‘Overdone’ Selloff\nInvestors’ flight from cooling names is “overdone,” Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz told clients. Cooling-system makers have relationships with chipmakers and data center operators, he said, and the risk that they’ll fall behind as data-center technology evolves is manageable.\n“While we acknowledge that the Rubin comments underscore the rapid evolution of thermal management in data centers, we don’t think this is catching our companies by surprise,” Kaplowitz said.\n\nStory Continues\nVertiv has a “strong position in liquid cooling” and may benefit from the developments that Huang discussed, according to Barclays’ Julian Mitchell, though its chiller business could suffer. The company’s stock fell as much as 6.8% on Tuesday before rebounding.\n“Given the primacy of Nvidia to the whole AI ecosystem, one should not take their comments lightly, although they seem rather dramatic at first glance,” Mitchell wrote.\n--With assistance from Matt Turner.\n(Updates selloff details in second paragraph and share moves in chart, adds Sandisk rally in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nZillow’s CEO Is Ready for Another Slow Year in the US Housing Market\nThe Curious Cult of Aldi\nDutch Bros Is Out-Starbucksing Rivals With the Sugariest Drinks\nOzempic Users Actually Spend More Dining Out.

      "Content": "Arm Holdings recently faced competitive pressure after a rival completed an acquisition in the chip design sector, prompting investors to reassess the company’s positioning in AI and its licensing model.\nAn interesting angle is how institutional investors are selectively increasing their exposure to Arm, signaling confidence in the long-term value of its AI-focused royalty and architecture roadmap despite the heightened competition.\nWe’ll now examine how this competitive shake-up, especially around AI chip design, could influence Arm’s existing investment narrative on royalties and growth.\n\nWe've found 14 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year . See the full list for free.\nArm Holdings Investment Narrative Recap To own Arm today, you generally need to believe its AI oriented licensing and royalty model can keep compounding even as competition in chip design intensifies. The recent rival acquisition has pressured the share price but does not clearly change Arm’s key near term catalyst, which remains broader adoption of its newer, higher royalty architectures in AI data centers. The biggest current risk is that rising R&D and expansion into subsystems and chiplets fail to translate into profitable growth.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Arm’s latest earnings update for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, stands out. The company reported revenue of US$1,135 million and net income of US$238 million, with guidance pointing to Q3 2026 revenue of about US$1,225 million ± US$50 million. For investors, these figures frame how Arm is executing on its higher royalty roadmap just as the AI chip design race heats up and competitive threats are back in focus.\nBut while the story sounds attractive, the heightened risk that big customers pursue more in house silicon is something investors should be very aware of...\nRead the full narrative on Arm Holdings (it's free!)\nArm Holdings' narrative projects $7.4 billion revenue and $2.3 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 21.5% yearly revenue growth and about a $1.6 billion earnings increase from $699.0 million today.\n\nUncover how Arm Holdings' forecasts yield a $164.85 fair value , a 42% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Some of the most optimistic analysts were expecting Arm’s revenue to reach about US$8.6 billion and earnings US$2.8 billion before this news, which is far more upbeat than consensus and assumes competition and customer self sufficiency risks stay manageable rather than reshaping the growth story.\nExplore 18 other fair value estimates on Arm Holdings - why the stock might be worth 46% less than the current price!\n\nStory Continues\nBuild Your Own Arm Holdings Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buying-tesla-save-car-owners-180013258.html",
      "Content": "Now that we are officially in 2026 and following recent EV incentive changes under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act (OBBBA), U.S. car buyers are wondering if an electric vehicle (EV), such as a Tesla, will truly save them money. Find out below.\nHow Does Trump’s OBBBA Change EV Tax Incentives? Trump signed OBBBA in 2025, making big changes to the incentives for buying EVs in the US. Basically, it eliminates the previous $7,500 federal EV tax credit and replaces it with a new vehicle loan interest deduction, according to American Progress .\nOBBBA’s goal was to introduce a “Buy American” incentive. Buyers financing a new vehicle assembled in the U.S. ( such as Teslas ) can deduct up to $10,000 in auto loan interest on their taxes. This makes the interest on a Tesla loan tax-deductible, which can potentially save you a few hundred to a few thousand dollars over the life of the loan.\n\nSee Next: How Much Does It Cost To Charge a Tesla?\nTrending Now: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nTesla vs. Gas Costs EV drivers spend about 60% less on fuel compared to gas car drivers, according to a report by Consumer Reports . A 2018 analysis by Forbes found that drivers spend around $485 per year for electricity versus $1,117 per year for gasoline on average.\nEVs also don’t need to have their oil changed or go through as many of the routine services that gas cars do. Per Atlas Public Policy , maintenance and repair costs are 40% lower per mile for EVs than for gas cars ($1,200 versus $500).\nThe table below compares a Tesla Model Y with a similar gasoline SUV’s expenses, assuming 12,000 miles driven per year, electricity is around 14 cents/kWh and gasoline is at $3.50/gal.\nTesla Model Y\nComparable Gas SUV\nCar price\n$39,990 to $57,490, per Find My Electric ($45,000 average)\n$40,000 average, per iSeeCars\nFederal EV tax credit\n$0 (credit expired)\n$0\nFuel / Electricity\n$2,500\n$7,500\nMaintenance\n$2,500\n$6,000\nFinal costs after 5 years\n~$50,000\n~$53,500\n\nThe new OBBBA interest deduction can further tip the scales in your favor if you finance your Tesla .\nEV Industry Outlook for 2026 Under the New Policy Removing the federal tax credit makes EVs relatively more expensive and could slow down EV sales growth in the short term. Additionally, the new law eliminated federal fuel-economy (CAFE) penalties for automakers, meaning companies no longer face fines for selling gas guzzlers, which reduces the pressure to produce EVs or high-MPG models.\n\nBut there are still plenty of indicators that suggest the EV momentum will continue. Market forces and technology are still moving in favor of EVs and the gap between EV and gasoline vehicle purchase costs continues to shrink to just $3,000 to $8,000 (per SolarTech ), with no sign of slowing down as battery prices get cheaper and cheaper. Not to mention, fuel and maintenance costs for EVs are still so much lower than those for gas cars.\n\nStory Continues\nCan You Still Save Money Buying a Tesla? While Trump’s tax bill removed a major perk for EVs, it is unlikely to stop the EV industry’s growth in 2026. This is because EVs are still economical. The longer you own a Tesla , the more the savings compound. After the break-even point is reached in a few years, every year of driving electric is money in your pocket. These operational savings are why many owners still find EVs economical in the long run, despite higher purchase prices and the lack of a federal tax credit.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Hybrid Cars for Middle-Class Retirees Getting Massive Price Drops for 2026\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Will Buying a Tesla Save Car Owners Big Money in 2026?",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arm-stock-down-20-vs-175000401.html",
      "Content": "Arm Holdings plc ARM shares have fallen 20% over the past year against an industry that advanced 38% during the same period. This noticeable gap should have put the stock under a spotlight, prompting you to reassess its near- and long-term prospects.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe key issue now is whether the weakness reflects deeper structural concerns or a temporary disconnect from Arm Holdings’ underlying fundamentals. Determining if the stock has further downside or is setting up for a meaningful recovery requires a closer look at the company’s positioning, strategic direction and the broader trends shaping its end markets.\n\nEnergy-Efficient AI at the Core of Arm’s Strategy Arm Holdings has evolved far beyond its roots as a traditional chip designer. Today, it sits at the heart of energy-efficient AI computing, enabling intelligence to scale seamlessly from edge devices to cloud data centers. Its RISC-based architecture delivers superior performance per watt, a critical advantage as AI adoption accelerates under tight power constraints. ARM’s Neoverse V-Series CPUs are increasingly shaping modern AI infrastructure by supporting faster inference and more efficient machine-learning workloads without the excessive energy costs associated with legacy architectures.\n\nA key differentiator is architectural consistency. A unified instruction set across mobile, cloud and edge environments allows developers to deploy AI applications with minimal friction, creating long-term strategic leverage. Partnerships, such as the one with Meta, underscore ARM’s growing relevance in data-center efficiency, while the addition of seasoned leadership from Amazon reflects a deeper push into advanced chipset innovation. Looking ahead, the planned AI chip division signals a shift toward becoming a strategic infrastructure provider rather than just a licensor, potentially strengthening Arm Holdings’ influence over AI performance economics and reinforcing its competitive moat.\nA Self-Reinforcing Ecosystem Advantage ARM’s durability stems from a powerful dual-sided network effect connecting software developers and hardware manufacturers. Device makers favor Arm Holdings’ architecture because it already supports a vast and mature software ecosystem spanning Android, iOS, Windows and Linux. This compatibility reduces integration risk and accelerates time to market, making Arm-based designs the logical choice for global hardware partners.\n\nDevelopers, in turn, are drawn to Arm because applications built on its architecture gain immediate access to an enormous installed base of devices. Each new hardware adoption expands this reach further, reinforcing a virtuous cycle in which developers and manufacturers continuously attract one another. Over time, this flywheel has created a formidable barrier to entry. With its intellectual property embedded in nearly every smartphone worldwide, ARM commands unparalleled scale in mobile CPU architecture, a position that remains difficult for competitors to dislodge.\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA NVDA competes with ARM in edge computing and AI-driven device workloads. NVIDIA benefits from its own ecosystem, but lacks ARM’s mobile reach. Even where NVIDIA pushes into low-power processors, the breadth of ARM compatibility limits its ability to displace existing standards. Qualcomm QCOM remains one of ARM’s most essential partners, yet also a peer, because Qualcomm builds mobile chips around ARM cores. The company depends heavily on ARM’s architecture, and its success in smartphones reinforces ARM’s position. Yet Qualcomm continues investing in custom designs to diversify, although ARM’s scale still keeps Qualcomm aligned with the platform.\n\nStrong Earnings and Revenue Growth Outlook Arm Holdings is positioned for solid earnings and revenue momentum over the next few years. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fiscal 2026 earnings at $1.72, representing about 5.5% growth from the prior year. Growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully in fiscal 2027, with earnings forecast to jump nearly 30% year over year. On the top line, ARM’s revenue outlook remains equally strong, with sales projected to rise more than 21% in both fiscal 2026 and 2027. This combination of steady near-term growth and sharp acceleration ahead highlights improving operating leverage and strengthening demand across Arm Holdings’ core markets.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nARM’s Valuation Remains Stretched ARM’s valuation continues to look demanding. The stock trades at roughly 55 times forward 12-month earnings, a clear premium compared with the industry average of about 34 times. Further, with Arm Holdings’ trailing EV-to-EBITDA multiple hovering near 93 times, far above the industry norm of around 25 times. Such elevated multiples suggest that a large portion of future growth is already priced in, leaving limited room for error. As a result, even solid execution may not prevent near-term volatility or valuation-driven pullbacks.\n\nHold: Quality Business, Timing Still Matters Arm Holdings remains a high-quality, strategically critical company with deep exposure to long-term AI and computing trends. Investors who already own the stock should continue to hold, as Arm’s ecosystem strength and architectural relevance support its long-term outlook. However, the current valuation leaves little margin for error and could cap near-term returns. For investors without a position, this is not an ideal entry point. It makes more sense to stay on the sidelines and wait. A better risk-reward setup may emerge if the stock consolidates or corrects further. This approach balances conviction with discipline.\n\nARM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-msft-solid-growth-stock-174502847.html",
      "Content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this software maker a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Microsoft is 14.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 14.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.9%.\nCash Flow Growth Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Microsoft is 23.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.8%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 19% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.8%.\n\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Microsoft. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line Microsoft has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Microsoft is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "AMD\n\nORCL\n\nCRWV\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nJensen Huang may have just delivered his most ambitious blueprint yet, but Wall Street is increasingly divided on whether Nvidia's ( NVDA ) breakneck growth is reaching a ceiling or just entering its second act.\n\"I think if you walk out of there thinking that this is an AI bubble, then you had a little too much something to drink in Vegas,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid . \"The reality is that ... we're talking about trillions of dollars being spent.\"\n\nHis comments came shortly after CEO Jensen Huang took the stage at CES 2026 to unveil the Vera Rubin platform — a suite of six new chips destined for mass production in the second half of the year. While Huang's keynote focused on physical AI — robots, autonomous cars, edge computing — the debate on the floor remains on the cold, hard math of data centers.\nWhile Ives remains the ultimate tech bull, eyeing a $6 trillion market cap for Nvidia, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria offered a more sober perspective. The skepticism lies in the \"cycle,\" he noted.\n\nFor two years, Nvidia has traded almost exclusively on the explosive demand for its AI GPUs. Luria suggested the market is starting to price in a rollover, questioning if the next phase can arrive fast enough to pick up the slack.\n\"Why Nvidia is so inexpensive is that really all it's pricing in is a data center market that's getting close to a peak,\" Luria said. He argued that Huang is already pivoting to \"what's next\" — putting GPUs into robots and automobiles. Still, \"timing\" remains the ultimate question, Luria noted.\n\nMeanwhile, the competition isn't sitting still. A day after Huang's keynote, Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su introduced the concept of \"yottaflop\" — a measure of computing power so vast it was previously theoretical.\nWhile Nvidia remains AI's gold standard, Ives said the market is underestimating AMD's potential to capture the \"next stage\" of the revolution.\n\"They are going to be a core player in this next stage of the AI revolution,\" Ives said. \"I don't think that's being factored into AMD's stock.\"\nHowever, the most telling part of the Wall Street clash isn't about the giants, but the infrastructure supporting them. Luria recently issued a \"reluctant upgrade\" on CoreWeave ( CRWV ) but made it clear his bearishness hasn't evaporated. He views players like CoreWeave and Oracle ( ORCL ) as \"marginal,\" accusing them of borrowing money to build \"speculative capacity\" while \"destroying\" shareholder value.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We continue to stay away from them,\" he said.\nA major catalyst for the continued \"AI party\" could come from outside Nvidia's walls. Luria pointed to OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) reported target to raise $100 billion in equity at a staggering $750 billion to $830 billion valuation by the end of March.\n\nIf OpenAI hits that number, the \"party goes into overdrive,\" as every major player doubles down on AI infrastructure. Still, Luria remains cautious, suggesting OpenAI \"may be a little too ambitious\" in its raise. If the funding environment cools, the massive orders for Nvidia's Rubin chips might not look so guaranteed.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The partnership, announced at CES in Las Vegas, will see Google's Gemini Robotics model deployed across several Boston Dynamics platforms, including the humanoid Atlas and the four-legged robot Spot. In the coming months, Gemini-powered Atlas robots are expected to be tested inside Hyundai auto factories, which management views as an early but practical setting to explore how advanced AI could translate into industrial automation.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ACN.\nIs GOOG fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAtlas already demonstrates advanced movement capabilities, but it has historically lacked the contextual understanding needed for flexible manual work. The addition of Gemini could help address that gap by improving environmental awareness, decision-making, and object manipulation, although it remains uncertain how closely machines can approach human-level dexterity. Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter has suggested that manufacturing environments, particularly Hyundai's facilities, are a logical place to begin deployment, while also noting that data collected from these robots could help further train Gemini to better operate in the physical world.\n\nThe announcement comes as competition in humanoid robotics continues to intensify, with Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) showcasing its Optimus humanoid alongside a growing number of US startups and a large field of Chinese developers. Google DeepMind, which hired Boston Dynamics' former CTO in November, appears focused on positioning Gemini as a general-purpose AI layer for many robot makers rather than building its own hardware. While both companies see broad potential for AI-controlled physical systems beyond automotive applications, they also acknowledge that safety considerations and risk mitigation will be critical as humanoid robots move closer to real-world deployment.",

      "Content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares rose slightly on Jan. 5, but it was not easy to overlook the company's fourth-quarter deliveries reported on Jan. 2. The company was responsible for 418,227 units delivered during the December quarter, missing Wall Street expectations and experiencing a 16% year-over-year (YOY) decline. For a company valued for flawless execution, another mishap was bound to increase investor attention.\n\nTaking a wider view, the story was much the same for 2025. Tesla produced around 1.65 million units, lower than the 1.78 million produced in 2024 and the peak in 2023. This represents the second successive fall in production, which in itself represents a departure for a company that has previously rewritten the rule book on defining growth in the automotive sector. Increasingly tough competition, particularly from China, looms large in the background.\nMore News from Barchart ‘I Was Probably the First CEO to Jump Behind That’: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang Says He Is Pushing Partners to Build In America\nDear Apple Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 12\nMicrosoft Stock Is Entering an ‘Inflection’ Year. What Dan Ives Thinks Is Coming for MSFT.\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nThis dichotomy was made vividly apparent this past week. BYD (BYDDY) saw a YOY increase of 27% for battery EV vehicles in 2025, surpassing Tesla and becoming the world’s largest EV seller. Meanwhile, the United States has experienced a slowing EV market. Fellow EV maker Rivian (RIVN) also experienced another YOY decline.\nAbout Tesla Stock The leader among pure EV plays, with its $1.4 trillion in market capitalization, remains Tesla (TSLA). Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla still holds massive mindshare in the industry but appears to be struggling in its stock performance due to slowing fundamental drivers.\nDuring the last 12 months, TSLA stock’s price action has been remarkably broad, ranging from about $214 to almost $500. Although TSLA stock has been experiencing weaknesses lately, it still represents a considerable gain since the 2024 bottom. Meanwhile, the overall market as tracked by the S&P 500 ($SPX) has shown much more steady performance.\nOn a forward-looking basis, Tesla is trading at 251 times earnings and 16.6 times sales, with margins of safety that loom large over traditional car companies and, in some cases, growth-oriented technology equities. The profitability-focused data is encouraging, with margins remaining strong by any car company measure, but with return on equity and asset values having declined sharply with mounting pricing pressures.\n\nStory Continues\nThe bottom line is that TSLA stock is priced for a change in trajectory rather than for a continuation of the present situation.\nTesla Misses on Deliveries TSLA stock suffered from the missed delivery targets, but it's worth noting that Tesla's Q4 earnings report had some positive aspects as well. For one thing, the company's production outpaced delivery for the period, with energy storage units reaching a record level of 14.2 gigawatts-hours for the quarter. This business seems to be one of Tesla's most steady growth drivers.\n\nStill, vehicle deliveries remain the principal earnings enabler for Tesla and, in this respect, things are less clear. Delivery of Models 3 and Y decreased YOY while lower-priced models were unable to compensate for the difference. Cost discipline and efficiency have been heavily emphasized by management, although it does become increasingly difficult to maintain margins with declining volumes.\nLooking ahead, it won’t take long for the investment community to gain more clarity. Tesla is set to share full financial results for Q4 on Jan. 28, when it will announce guidance and provide commentary related to issues like pricing, autonomy, and capital allocation.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Tesla Stock? Wall Street is still very split on TSLA stock with a current “Hold” consensus rating. The price targets for Tesla range from a low of $120 to a high of $600, with a mean target of approximately $395. The mean price target forecasts a downside move for TSLA from the current price, which is a very unusual situation for a stock that has historically been associated with a very positive outlook.\nThis split reflects two different stories. The bulls believe in long-term call options regarding autonomy, AI, and energy storage, which supports rich valuations.\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "At CES 2026, Intel unveiled its Core Ultra Series 3 processors, the first AI PC and edge platform built on the new US-manufactured Intel 18A process and set to power more than 200 PC designs as well as certified embedded and industrial systems.\nBy combining integrated AI acceleration and Arc graphics into a single system-on-chip that can also serve robotics, smart cities, and other edge workloads, the launch ties Intel’s PC roadmap directly to its ambitions in advanced manufacturing and industrial AI.\nWe’ll now examine how launching Intel’s first 18A-based Core Ultra Series 3 platform, spanning PCs and edge devices, affects its investment narrative.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover 29 stocks that are working to make quantum computing a reality .\nIntel Investment Narrative Recap To own Intel here, you have to believe its push into US-made advanced manufacturing, AI PCs and edge computing can translate into healthier margins and steadier earnings. The Core Ultra Series 3 launch on Intel 18A is the clearest near term proof point for that story, while the biggest risk remains whether Intel can execute on new process nodes at scale without further straining its already tight capital and operating cost base.\n\nThe CES reveal of Core Ultra Series 3, together with Advantech’s plan to integrate these 18A-based chips into industrial motherboards and edge AI systems, directly ties into Intel’s AI and foundry catalysts. It shows the same silicon can target both consumer PCs and higher value edge workloads, which matters for any thesis that depends on better asset utilization and a broader mix of AI driven revenue rather than legacy PC cycles alone.\nYet behind the excitement around 18A, investors should also be aware of the risk that...\nRead the full narrative on Intel (it's free!)\nIntel's narrative projects $58.1 billion revenue and $5.2 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 3.1% yearly revenue growth and a $25.7 billion earnings increase from $-20.5 billion today.\n\nUncover how Intel's forecasts yield a $38.14 fair value , a 3% downside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Compared with the baseline view, the most bullish analysts were already assuming Intel could lift revenue to about US$62.1 billion and earnings to roughly US$8.7 billion by 2028, so if Core Ultra Series 3 truly accelerates the 18A ramp, it may pull their AI and foundry catalyst forward while also sharpening the risk that execution on those same nodes falls short of these optimistic expectations.\nExplore 39 other fair value estimates on Intel - why the stock might be worth as much as 32% more than the current price!\n\nStory continues\nBuild Your Own Intel Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-qualcomm-qcom-171033380.html",
      "Content": "If you are wondering whether QUALCOMM's current share price lines up with its underlying value, you are not alone. This article is built to help you make sense of that question.\nQUALCOMM recently closed at US$176.31, with total shareholder returns of 1.5% over the past 7 days, 0.9% over 30 days, 1.9% year to date, 12.3% over 1 year, 61.4% over 3 years and 27.1% over 5 years. This provides plenty of history for a valuation check.\nRecent coverage of QUALCOMM has focused on its position within the semiconductor industry and how the market is reacting to that exposure, especially as investors reassess risk and growth potential across chipmakers. This backdrop helps frame the current share price, because sentiment around the sector often feeds directly into how a company like QUALCOMM is valued.\nQUALCOMM currently has a value score of 2 out of 6 , which means it screens as undervalued on 2 of the 6 checks we will walk through next. We will compare common valuation approaches before finishing with a way to think about value that goes beyond any single model.\n\nQUALCOMM scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: QUALCOMM Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to today at an appropriate rate. It is essentially asking what all those future dollars are worth in today's terms.\nFor QUALCOMM, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $12.6b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates suggest Free Cash Flow of roughly $15.2b by 2030, with a series of annual projections between 2026 and 2035 that are discounted back to present value.\n\nSimply Wall St aggregates these discounted cash flows into an estimated intrinsic value of US$164.35 per share. Compared to the recent share price of US$176.31, the DCF output suggests the stock is about 7.3% overvalued, which is a relatively small gap rather than a glaring mispricing.\nResult: ABOUT RIGHT\nQUALCOMM is fairly valued according to our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) , but this can change at a moment's notice. Track the value in your watchlist or portfolio and be alerted on when to act.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for QUALCOMM.\nApproach 2: QUALCOMM Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like QUALCOMM, the P/E ratio is a useful way to relate what you are paying to what the business is currently earning. It ties the share price directly to earnings per share, which many investors treat as a core anchor for value.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat counts as a reasonable P/E also depends on how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually points to a lower one.\nQUALCOMM currently trades on a P/E of 33.82x. That compares with an average P/E of 38.66x for the Semiconductor industry and a peer average of 88.84x, so the stock sits below those broader benchmarks. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio of 32.47x for QUALCOMM, which reflects factors such as its earnings growth profile, profitability, industry, market value and specific risks.\n\nThis Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for QUALCOMM’s own characteristics rather than assuming all chip stocks deserve the same multiple. With the current P/E only slightly above the Fair Ratio, the shares look priced close to that model’s estimate.\nResult: ABOUT RIGHT\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1454 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your QUALCOMM Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about a company, linked directly to your own assumptions for fair value, future revenue, earnings and margins.\nOn Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page and are used by millions of investors as an easy tool where you connect a company’s story to a financial forecast and then to a fair value. You can then compare that fair value with the current share price to help decide whether you see QUALCOMM as expensive, cheap or roughly in line with your expectations.\n\nBecause Narratives on the platform refresh when new information comes in, like QUALCOMM’s FY2025 results with US$11.7b of revenue and record EPS of US$3.41, or updated analyst targets that range from about US$140 to US$225, your view can stay current. Two investors can reasonably hold very different QUALCOMM Narratives. For example, one may anchor on a Community fair value of about US$300 that leans heavily on Edge AI, PCs and automotive growth, and another may be closer to US$191.80 that leans on more modest analyst assumptions. Both can clearly see how their story, numbers and fair value line up against today’s price.\nDo you think there's more to the story for QUALCOMM?

      "Content": "ACLS\n\nTER\n\nAMAT\n\nKLA Corporation KLAC shares have jumped 96.2% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 24.6% and the Zacks Electronics-Miscellaneous Products industry’s appreciation of 22.3%. KLA is benefiting from its dominant process control market share, strong AI infrastructure investment and momentum in advanced packaging.\n\nThe company has outperformed peers, including Applied Materials AMAT, Teradyne TER and Axcelis Technologies ACLS, in the past year. Shares of Applied Materials, Teradyne and Axcelis have returned 28.78%, 58.2% and 20.8%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nKLAC Stock’s Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThese factors justify a premium valuation as suggested by a Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), KLAC is trading at 35.02X, higher than the broader sector and peers. The broader sector is trading at 27.66X while Applied Materials and Axcelis trade at 28.78X and 19.57X, respectively. However, Teradyne is pricey with a P/E multiple of 43.04.\n\nKLAC Stock’s Valuation\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnically, KLA is currently trading above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\nKLA Stock Trades Above 50-Day & 200-Day SMAs\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nKLA's Prospects Ride on Strong Advanced Packaging Growth KLA is benefiting from strong demand for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging, which is driving top-line growth. Advanced packaging revenues are expected to exceed $925 million in calendar 2025, up roughly 70% from calendar 2024. Strong investments in WFE and advanced packaging represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. Growth of advanced packaging supporting heterogeneous chip integration has become a new market for KLA, which is currently worth $11 billion and growing faster than core WFE.\n\nKLA’s robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. Process control accelerates time to results by resolving process integration challenges during the fab ramp-up phase to optimize time to market for a diverse mix of semiconductor designs.\n\nMoreover, the growing investment in custom silicon, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of unique device designs. This has put customers under pressure to deliver performance, volume and time to market, resulting in strong demand for advanced process control. This aids KLA’s prospects as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology and yield optimization solutions. This bodes well for KLAC’s top-line growth.\n\nKLAC expects to meaningfully outperform the mid-to high single-digit WFE growth rate estimated in 2025, driven by rising process control intensity, inclusive of the significant growth of the advanced packaging market. The advanced packaging market is also expected to grow more than 20% in 2025 compared to last year. For 2026, HBM is expected to grow faster than overall logic/foundry growth next year. Over the long term, KLAC targets to deliver 40% to 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on strong revenue growth.\n\nStory Continues\nStrong Liquidity to Boost KLAC’s Prospects KLA generates solid cash flow, which allows management the opportunity to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and business development. The company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2026 with $4.7 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt. The company has a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, operating cash flow was $1.16 billion, whereas the free cash flow was $1.07 billion. In the fiscal first quarter, KLAC repurchased $545 million worth of shares and paid $254 million in dividends.\n\nKLAC’s 2026 Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Positive Trend The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $35.44 per share, up a couple of cents over the past 30 days and indicating 6.5% growth from 2025’s reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $13.04 billion, suggesting 7.3% growth from the 2025’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Corporation Price and Consensus KLA Corporation price-consensus-chart | KLA Corporation Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $8.75 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days and indicating 6.7% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $3.24 billion, suggesting 5.4% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nConclusion KLA benefits from strong demand for leading-edge logic, HBM and advanced packaging. These factors are expected to help the stock continue its momentum in 2026.\n\nKLA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of B, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commonwealth-fusion-systems-installs-reactor-163000527.html",
      "Content": "Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year.\nThe magnet is the first of 18 that, when the reactor is complete, will create a doughnut-like shape that will produce a powerful magnetic field to confine and compress superheated plasma. If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.\n\nAfter decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — CFS and its competitors are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.\nKey components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”\nWhen installed, the D-shaped magnets would sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March . The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.\n\nTo hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.\nTo work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries.\nThat won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.”\nThe hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.\n\nStory Continues\nBuilding Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates.\nMumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here .",

Have you ever heard of a yottaflop?\n00:09 Speaker A\nUh she mentioned it. I never heard of it. Is it a big deal for the chip industry?\n00:15 Dan\nLook, and first I just want to say Gil mentioned a great point about what's being baked into Nvidia here. I think that's really important. Like just a tip of the sphere and I think that's important what's happened in terms of valuations across the board.\n00:27 Dan\nLook, the reality is like Lisa Su and AMD. Look, if Lisa Su's flying the plane, I'm in 3A, feeling really good watching Netflix.\n00:36 Dan\nBecause the reality is is that they are going to be a core player in this next stage of the AI revolution. I don't think that's being factored into MD stock. That's why, you know, we think, you know, 350 is not out of the question in terms of where this thing could go. But I think this is going to be a big conversation on the floor today at CES in terms of what we heard from Lisa.\n00:54 Speaker A\nDan, love to know this morning, uh you think that Nvidia can exceed a $5 trillion dollar market cap in the near term and ultimately a $6 trillion dollar market cap.\n01:05 Speaker A\nI I don't think I've seen that 6 trillion number from you before.

      "Content": "SIEGY\n\nNVDA\n\nTogether, PepsiCo, Siemens, and NVIDIA will set a new standard for scalable, technically sound digital twin and AI in industrial operations.\nLAS VEGAS and PURCHASE, N.Y. , Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- At CES 2026, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) announced a multi-year, industry-first collaboration with Siemens and NVIDIA to transform plant and supply chain operations through advanced digital twin technology and AI. This collaboration marks a first-of-its-kind initiative for a global CPG company applying digital twins to reshape how plant and warehousing facilities are digitally simulated and tested, with early pilots already underway in the U.S.\nWith demand for production and distribution capacity rising, PepsiCo is using AI and new digital approaches to process simulation and facility design to retool and optimize its existing physical footprint. Traditional expansion methods are slow and costly, limiting flexibility and the scalability needed to meet growing consumer needs while driving innovation.\n\n\"The scale and complexity of PepsiCo's business, from farm to shelf, is massive—and we are embedding AI throughout our operations to better meet the increasing demands of our consumers and customers,\" said Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. \"Our work with Siemens and NVIDIA will help accelerate our continued journey of becoming a future-fit company, operating with agility and foresight.\"\nPepsiCo is shifting to a digital-first planning strategy, leveraging physics-based digital twins and AI agents as co-designers to simulate, validate, and optimize facility layouts before any physical build. As part of these efforts, PepsiCo is using Siemens Digital Twin Composer, built on NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, to simulate upgrades to its facilities in the U.S. with plans to scale globally.\n\n\"Physical industries are entering the age of AI. For companies with real-world assets, digital twins are the foundation of their AI journey,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"Working with NVIDIA and Siemens, PepsiCo is re-architecting its operations—using physically accurate digital twins and AI to reinvent how it designs, optimizes, and runs its global operations.\"\n\"We are proud to partner with PepsiCo and NVIDIA to digitally transform their manufacturing facilities using physics-based digital twins and AI from design to engineering to operations. The Digital Twin Composer is a cornerstone in enabling PepsiCo to transform manufacturing and warehousing,\" said Roland Busch, CEO of Siemens AG. \"Siemens is powering the industrial AI revolution – with an unmatched industrial AI technology stack, deep domain knowhow, and world-class partners. This collaboration sets a new standard for all industries. Customers can turn ideas into real-world impact with greater speed, quality, and efficiency.\"\n\nStory Continues\nSiemens' new software solution builds Industrial Metaverse environments at scale, empowering organizations to apply industrial AI, simulation and real-time physical data to make decisions virtually, at speed and at scale.\nThis new product enables industrial companies to combine 2D and 3D digital twin data from Siemens' comprehensive digital twin and physical real-time information from a managed, secure real-time photorealistic virtual scene accelerated by NVIDIA Omniverse libraries. With Digital Twin Composer, companies can rapidly build and maintain this global environment, containing all aspects of their product or production data (both virtual and physical) in a secure, managed, high-fidelity 3D experience throughout the lifecycle of the product, process or facility.\n\nPepsiCo and Siemens are digitally transforming select U.S. manufacturing and warehouse facilities by converting them into high-fidelity 3D digital twins that simulate plant operations and the end-to-end supply chain to establish a performance baseline. Within weeks, teams optimized and validated new configurations to boost capacity and throughput, giving PepsiCo a unified, real-time view of operations with flexibility to integrate AI-driven capabilities over time.\nLeveraging Siemens' Digital Twin Composer, NVIDIA Omniverse and computer vision, PepsiCo can now recreate every machine, conveyor, pallet route and operator path with physics-level accuracy, enabling AI agents to simulate, test, and refine system changes - identifying up to 90 percent of potential issues before any physical modifications occur. This approach has already delivered a 20 percent increase in throughput on initial deployment and is driving faster design cycles, nearly 100 percent design validation and 10 to 15 percent reductions in capital expenditure (Capex) by uncovering hidden capacity and validating investments in a virtual environment.\n\n\"We are deploying the first digital blueprint that reimagines how the supply chain is designed, built, and scaled, a first for the industry,\" says Athina Kanioura, CEO, Latin America, and Global Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer of PepsiCo. \"With a unified, AI-powered digital foundation, PepsiCo is building toward a world where every plant and warehouse operates as part of a single, intelligent ecosystem. In this future, our facilities don't just respond to demand, they anticipate and then adapt to it.\"\nAnnouncement at CES 2026\nThis partnership was formally announced during the opening keynote at CES 2026, highlighting PepsiCo's commitment to digital transformation and supply chain innovation. The collaboration brings together Siemens' Industrial AI expertise and comprehensive digital twin technology with NVIDIA's AI and visualization expertise to set a new standard for the industry.\n\nAbout PepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.

      "Content": "GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nQuick Read Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) has finally reclaimed its dot-com era highs more than 25 years after the internet bubble burst.\nThe stock’s recovery underscores how even dominant technology leaders can take decades to regain lost ground after hype-driven valuations collapse.\nCisco’s survival was driven by steady infrastructure demand and dividends, not explosive growth, offering a cautionary lesson for today’s AI-driven enthusiasm.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus\n\nWatch the Video Our discussion started by going back to the late 1990s, when Cisco was one of the hottest stocks on the planet. At the height of the dot-com boom, it sat at the center of the internet buildout and seemed unstoppable.\nThe peak and the long fall I pointed out that Cisco traded around $75 to $80 during the dot-com frenzy. When the bubble burst in 2000 and 2001, the stock collapsed and effectively disappeared from the market conversation. It did not fail as a business, but it vanished as a growth story, and for most investors, it stayed buried for decades.\n\nLee agreed that this is exactly what happens when expectations get wildly ahead of reality. The internet changed the world, but the valuations attached to it at the time were completely exaggerated.\nWhy Cisco survived What kept Cisco alive was not hype, but necessity. Its networking equipment remained essential infrastructure. Over the years, the company continued selling routers, switches, and enterprise networking gear, and today that same core business supports data centers and AI-related buildouts.\nI noted that Cisco never stopped being relevant. It simply stopped being exciting.\n\nThe lesson for modern investors We both emphasized why this matters now. Investors chasing today’s mega-cap technology and AI leaders should remember Cisco. Even great companies can get buried by valuation excess and stay buried far longer than most people expect.\nLee made the point that if you bought Cisco at the bottom in 2001 or 2002, you did very well. But if you bought near the peak and simply held, it took roughly 25 years just to get back to even.\n\nDividends and patience I also highlighted Cisco’s dividend, which became an important part of its appeal over time. It regularly showed up in our lists of technology stocks that actually pay shareholders. That income helped long-term holders survive the long wait.\nWe closed by agreeing that Cisco’s story is a reminder that no matter how dominant a company looks, market cycles can be brutal and unforgiving. Survival is not the same as success, and patience in technology investing can be tested for decades.\n\nStory Continues\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee. There's another way to look at, tech stocks that are, big AI players, so certainly Meta (NASDAQ: META) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . The assumption right now that most investors have is there's no barrier to AI adoption. None. It's just gonna, it's gonna go on forever and ever, and people don't need to worry about it.\n\n[00:00:25] What they're not taking into account is the fact that you cannot build an AI data center overnight. Hardly. Well, I started to look at this. There's a three year backlog for transformers. Why? Because people are starting to build data centers and the transformer business people didn't forecast that they were gonna need an extra a hundred thousand transformers wouldn't, why would they?\n[00:00:52] It, I'm sure it's expensive to build a transformer. You've gotta hold in an inventory. Yeah.\n[00:00:57] Yeah, So there are these real world, oh shucks. I didn't think about it. There's a, an electric wire outside myself, my house here that's on a wooden pole. It hasn't occurred to people that we are dealing with a grid that is ancient.\n\n[00:01:14] Lee Jackson: Oh my God. It's, it is ancient, It is, and you're exactly right. and some small towns now, or smaller communities that are starting to push back because their grid is so bad anyway that their, the electricity is expensive and then, a big AI data center that's gonna come in and then nearby and soak up more power.\n[00:01:39] I think a lot of places are gonna start pushing back on this.\n[00:01:42] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So if, we've mentioned a lot of the positives about investing in companies that are big AI players. Oh yeah. There is one negative and people who own these stocks, my advice to people is don't just look at the industry your company is in.\n[00:01:58] Look at every single industry that touches it, right? Every single industry that could influence its success or its failure. Right now, let's just call it the electric infrastructure in the United States is very, very old. Very old. The cost of upgrading it is in the hundreds of billions of dollars if you want to go across the whole country, at least.\n\n[00:02:21] Lee Jackson: Oh, at least. Yeah. At least.\n[00:02:23] Doug McIntyre: And the pace at which you can do it is not fast. You can't just go out and take all these poles and everything else and say, well, we're gonna rip 'em out and put in new ones. In some of the areas where they want to build data centers, there's a two or three year wait before they're gonna be able to get the electricity.\n[00:02:42] Lee Jackson: Yeah, no, I, I think, and, a lot of these guys are making deals with power companies or, in the case of some, they're going out and gonna build out in the Permian, where they have a supply of natural gas directly to a, an energy producing station out there. It's gonna change a lot of things and again, I think, in the next 10 years, the nuclear power industry will be huge, not just because of AI and data centers, but the matter of the reality is that renewables, we hear about it all the time. All the time, well, number one, having, I'm from Texas and I have friends that I haven't lived there in a while, but I have friends that were there two and three years ago when the renewables failed in the winter because of the snow and the ice, and it was a nightmare.\n\n[00:03:30] And renewables, I mean, sure everybody wants clean energy and everybody wants to do the best for the environment they can. And that's laudable, and it goes back for, at least from a Republican standpoint to Teddy Roosevelt. But the reality is that renewables are not gonna be able to fill the void when they're doing 11% of the total, 14% of the total because they fail and weather, they're weather related. And so that's gonna roll into this, I think nuclears 10 years from now, we'll see a lot more, we'll see the kind of nuclear plants we saw when we were young, and you and I both grew up in Michigan and there was a big one in Michigan.\n[00:04:09] Doug McIntyre: There'll be more nuclear plants. The Trump administration has opened the door to more oil, right? More gas, more corn, more net gas. So as far as I'm concerned, energy is not going to be the issue. Transmission of energy is going to be the issue. Absolutely.\n\n[00:04:28] Lee Jackson: I'm, it'll be, and availability in some of these areas where they're going into, it's one thing to be in the southeast, in a corridor near DC and in that area where all those big utility companies, but you know what, if you're out in North Dakota or South Dakota or someplace like that, where, it's not as easily accessible, you're exactly right.\n[00:04:47] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So anyway, for all of you who are interested in AI stocks, remember that AI stocks aren't just AI stocks, they're also energy stocks. They're also grid stocks.\n[00:04:58] Lee Jackson: Yep. So pick your poison when you're going after 'em. But, it'll be interesting to see how this, and, it'll probably really start to manifest in the next year or so\n\n[00:05:08] 'cause a lot of this stuff is under construction. But yeah, it's gonna be an issue.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus If you spend a good amount on Amazon, this card could easily put $100s back in your pocket every year . Even better, you could get approved extremely fast — and if you are, you’ll receive an insanely valuable welcome bonus deposited straight into your Amazon account for immediate use.\nNo hoops or extra spending. Get approved, and the bonus is yours. If you shop at Amazon or Whole Foods, this card could help you earn meaningful cash back from purchases you’re already making. This offer won’t last forever, and for Prime members, it’s basically a no-brainer.\nAmazon Prime members: See what you could get, no strings attached",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-nvidia-nvda-strong-161130621.html",
      "Content": "Wondering if NVIDIA's share price still makes sense after such a strong run, or if you might be paying too much for growth? This article focuses squarely on what the current price could mean for value conscious investors.\nNVIDIA closed at US$188.12, with returns of 0.3% over the last 7 days, 3.1% over the last 30 days, a 0.4% decline year to date, and 34.3% over the last year. These moves raise questions about how much future growth or risk is already built into the price.\nRecent headlines have continued to focus on NVIDIA's role in high performance computing and artificial intelligence, keeping the company at the center of discussion around graphics processing and data center demand. At the same time, commentary around chip supply, regulatory attention and competition has added context to recent share price moves by reminding investors that sentiment can shift quickly.\nOn our checks, NVIDIA has a valuation score of 2 out of 6 , which suggests only some metrics point to value right now. Next, we will look at what traditional valuation methods say about the stock and then finish with a more holistic way to think about what the market is really pricing in.\n\nNVIDIA scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: NVIDIA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model takes a company’s expected future cash flows and discounts them back to today to estimate what the business might be worth per share right now.\nFor NVIDIA, the model used here is a 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on cash flow projections in $. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $77.96b. Analyst inputs and extrapolated estimates suggest projected free cash flow reaching about $287.49b in 2030, with a detailed path of yearly forecasts between 2026 and 2035 provided by various analyst sources and internal estimates.\n\nBringing all those projected cash flows back to today results in an estimated intrinsic value of US$161.14 per share under this DCF. Compared with the current share price of US$188.12, the model implies the stock is about 16.7% above this estimate, which points to a valuation that is richer than what this particular cash flow model supports.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests NVIDIA may be overvalued by 16.7%. Discover 880 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for NVIDIA.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: NVIDIA Price vs Earnings (P/E) For profitable companies like NVIDIA, the P/E ratio is a common way to gauge what you are paying for each dollar of earnings. It ties the share price directly to current earnings, which many investors find more tangible than long range cash flow estimates.\nWhat counts as a “normal” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nNVIDIA is trading on a P/E of 46.08x. That is above the broader semiconductor industry average of 38.66x, but below the peer group average of 62.17x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for NVIDIA is 57.47x, which is its estimate of a reasonable P/E given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.\nThe Fair Ratio can be more useful than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming every semiconductor stock should trade on the same multiple. With NVIDIA’s current P/E below the 57.47x Fair Ratio, this approach suggests that the shares may be undervalued on earnings.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1454 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your NVIDIA Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This simply means attaching your story about a company to the numbers you think are reasonable for its fair value, revenue, earnings and margins.\nOn Simply Wall St, Narratives sit on the Community page and give you an easy way to link NVIDIA’s story to a forecast and then to a fair value. You can then quickly compare that fair value with today’s share price to decide whether the stock looks expensive or cheap to you.\n\nBecause Narratives update automatically when new information such as earnings reports or major news comes in, they stay aligned with what is actually happening rather than a one off spreadsheet you forget to revisit.\nFor example, one NVIDIA Narrative currently puts fair value at about US$345.07 per share while another is closer to US$87 to US$104. This shows how different investors, all using their own assumptions about AI demand, competition and margins, can reach very different conclusions and gives you a clear range to think about where your own view sits.\nFor NVIDIA, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading NVIDIA narratives:\n🐂 NVIDIA Bull Case\nFair value estimate: US$253.02\nImplied discount to this fair value at US$188.12: 25.6% below\n\nRevenue growth assumption: 30.9%\nAnalysts see ongoing AI and digitization demand supporting broad based data center and infrastructure revenue for NVIDIA across many sectors.\nThe narrative leans on NVIDIA's full stack approach in hardware, networking and software ecosystems to support high margins and recurring revenue.\nKey risks center on export controls, custom chips from large customers, dependence on TSMC, power and regulatory constraints for data centers, and rising costs.\n🐻 NVIDIA Bear Case\nFair value estimate: US$90.15\nImplied premium to this fair value at US$188.12: very large, around 2x this estimate\nRevenue growth assumption: 15.93%\nThe narrative argues NVIDIA is priced to perfection, with very high margins and a valuation that already reflects dominant AI infrastructure positioning.\nIt highlights potential pressure from alternative accelerators, open source software progress, in house chips at large tech companies, and efficiency gains such as those reported by DeepSeek.\nUsing a discounted cash flow based on Professor Aswath Damodaran's assumptions, it arrives at a fair value of about US$90 per share, with future P/E and margin assumptions that are lower than today.\n\nThese two narratives give you a clear range, from a very optimistic AI infrastructure supercycle view to a much more cautious priced for perfection stance. If you want to weigh which story feels closer to your own assumptions about AI demand, competition and policy risk, the full narratives and their detailed numbers are the best place to start.\nCurious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

      "Content": "BYDDY\n\nTSLA\n\nBYD Company Limited has reported unaudited 2025 figures showing full-year vehicle sales and production rising versus 2024, even as December volumes eased, while the group also reshaped its UK leadership and continued building out its dealer network.\nThese results confirm that BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of battery electric vehicles, underscoring how its global expansion is progressing despite slower growth and intense price competition at home.\nWe’ll now examine how BYD surpassing Tesla in global battery electric vehicle sales reframes the company’s investment narrative and future positioning.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 29 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery . The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.\nWhat Is BYD's Investment Narrative? For BYD, the crux of the investment case is whether you believe it can turn its new global scale in battery electric vehicles into durable profitability, despite slower growth and fierce price pressure at home. The latest unaudited 2025 figures show full-year sales and production still up year on year, but with a weaker December and a trimmed sales target, which keeps near term demand and pricing firmly in focus as key catalysts. BYD overtaking Tesla as the largest BEV seller repositions the story toward global execution quality, product breadth and export momentum, while the UK leadership reshuffle and dealer build-out underline how seriously management is treating Europe as a growth offset to China. That said, the softer exit to 2025 may increase investor attention on margins and capital discipline.\n\nHowever, one risk in particular may matter more than the headline EV sales win. BYD's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 14%. Find out what it's worth .\nExploring Other Perspectives Investors in the Simply Wall St Community have 24 fair value views on BYD, stretching from HK$114.83 to a very large HK$449.47. That spread sits against recent concerns about decelerating unit growth and China price pressure, which could influence how sustainably the company’s new BEV leadership position translates into future financial performance.\n\nExplore 24 other fair value estimates on BYD - why the stock might be worth just HK$114.83!\nBuild Your Own BYD Narrative Disagree with this assessment?

      "Content": "Leveraging NVIDIA AI infrastructure and drawing from the world's leading music catalog comprising millions of culture-defining tracks, this collaboration aims to pioneer responsible AI for music discovery, creation, and engagement\nSANTA MONICA, Calif. , Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Music Group (EURONEXT: UMG), the world leader in music-based entertainment, announced today a collaboration with NVIDIA to pioneer responsible AI for music discovery, creation, and engagement leveraging NVIDIA AI infrastructure and UMG's industry-leading music catalog comprising millions of tracks covering every genre and era.\nUMG is collaborating with NVIDIA to enrich and enhance the music experience of the billions of music consumers worldwide who enjoy the world's most popular form of entertainment. NVIDIA and UMG will undertake collaborative research and development to promote shared objectives of advancing human music creation and rightsholder compensation.\n\nThe collaboration will explore new avenues to enrich music experiences by utilizing AI to elevate discovery, engagement and consumption beyond current constructs of search and personalization.

It uses chain-of-thought reasoning to enable nuanced interpretation of musical elements, from chord progressions to emotional arcs. NVIDIA Music Flamingo outperforms leading models across 10+ benchmarks in music captioning, instrument recognition, and multilingual lyric transcription. By interpreting the deeper layers of each track, Music Flamingo enables listeners to explore music in ways that go far beyond traditional tags or genres, making discovery more personal and meaningful.\nEnhancing Fan Engagement: These technologies help unlock interactive experiences that allow artists to connect with audiences beyond conventional playlists or search. For artists, Music Flamingo opens new creative possibilities—providing tools to analyze, describe, and share their music with unprecedented depth. For fans, it powers richer discovery experiences, surfacing songs not just by genre or tempo, but by emotional narrative and cultural resonance, helping established artists reach fans in deeper, more interactive ways, while providing emerging artists with greater opportunities to be discovered by music lovers who are the most likely to become dedicated fans.\nEmpowering Artists with Creation Tools: To ensure AI-driven music creation tools genuinely empower artists, NVIDIA and UMG will establish a dedicated artist incubator. This incubator brings together artists, songwriters, and producers to co-design and test new AI-powered tools, integrating them into real-world creative workflows. By prioritizing hands-on artist involvement, the incubator develops solutions that enhance originality and authenticity—serving as a direct antidote to generic, \"AI slop\" outputs, and placing artists at the center of responsible AI innovation.\n\nStory Continues\nSir Lucian Grainge, UMG's Chairman and CEO, said, \"We're excited to establish this ground-breaking strategic relationship which unites the world's leading technology company with the world's leading music company in a shared mission to harness revolutionary AI technology to dramatically advance the interests of the creative community and the role of music in global culture. We eagerly embrace the opportunities that AI presents, and the fact that NVIDIA is choosing to take a leadership position in the tech industry in their commitment to responsible AI principles is critically important. We look forward to working closely with NVIDIA to direct AI's unprecedented transformational potential towards the service of artists and their fans as we work together to set new standards for innovation within the industry, while protecting and respecting copyright and human creativity.\"\n\nUMG's Music & Advanced Machine Learning Lab (MAML) previously trained its models using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure. The collaboration will employ both companies' research capabilities, establishing creative laboratories that foster comprehensive input from artists, songwriters, music labels and publishers, in part by leveraging UMG's world-class studio operations such as Abbey Road Studios in London and Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. In addition, UMG will use NVIDIA AI infrastructure in the development of responsibly trained AI-driven business and creative processes.\nThroughout the collaboration, NVIDIA will work with UMG and its artists to obtain in-depth feedback on product development that will empower established artists to engage with their fans in deeper, more interactive ways, while also providing emerging artists with unprecedented opportunities to be discovered and connect with new audiences worldwide.\n\n\"We're entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe — conversational, contextual, and genuinely interactive\", said Richard Kerris, NVIDIA VP/GM of Media. \"By extending NVIDIA's Music Flamingo with UMG's unmatched catalog and creative ecosystem, we're going to change how fans discover, understand, and engage with music on a global scale. And we'll do it the right way: responsibly, with safeguards that protect artists' work, ensure attribution, and respect copyright.\"\nAs this collaboration sets new standards for innovation and responsibility in the music industry, artists and fans alike stand to benefit from the transformative potential of AI. NVIDIA and UMG are committed to shaping a future where technology and creativity unite to unlock new possibilities for artists and fans everywhere.\n\nFor media enquiries contact:\nUniversal Music Group\nJames Murtagh-Hopkins james.murtagh-hopkins@umusic.com\nAbout Universal Music Group\nUniversal Music Group exists to shape culture through the power of artistry.

      "Content": "GEHC\n\nCollaboration focuses on the development of two advanced edge AI concepts in anesthesiology and neonatal care designed to help improve patient care.\nNXP and GE HealthCare Collaborate\nLAS VEGAS and CHICAGO, Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI) and GE HealthCare (NASDAQ: GEHC) today announced a collaboration to pioneer new advancements in edge AI innovation leveraging NXP’s long history in secure, high-performance edge processing and GE HealthCare’s deep experience in medical technology innovation. Beginning with new anesthesia and neonatal concepts showcased at CES 2026 , the collaboration highlights how the intelligence, low latency, resilience, and security offered by edge AI can transform certain workflows and empower clinicians to deliver improved patient care with simple, actionable insights.\n\nIn acute care environments like the operating room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), care teams require solutions that provide actionable intelligence delivered with low latency. On-device edge AI processes data to deliver immediate, consistent performance and help enable critical insights to be available without delay. Embedding edge AI into point-of-care devices may provide clinicians fast, reliable, and secure access to critical information.\nGE HealthCare and NXP have formulated two new concepts 1 combining NXP’s edge AI expertise and portfolio with GE HealthCare’s experience in medical technology innovations. The first concept brings edge AI capabilities to anesthesia delivery in the operating room, intending to provide anesthesiologists with a reliable, hands-free way to interact with anesthesia equipment using real-time voice commands. This project is designed to help anesthesiologists attend to the patient in a dynamic and crowded operating room, while reducing excessive cognitive load, alarm fatigue, and risk of human error.\n\nThe second concept is designed to support neonatal care through intelligent, live monitoring. This technology aims to detect whether an infant is crying or at rest, identify unwanted objects in the bed, or recognize if the baby has rolled onto their stomach — designed to help care teams and enable them to keep babies comfortable. This concept uses agentic AI on the edge to log the event and alert clinicians, if appropriate. All image processing occurs locally using models leveraging the NXP eIQ AI Toolkit . No images leave the device, supporting strict security and privacy standards.\nThe development of both concepts is underpinned by GE HealthCare’s Responsible AI principles , which include a focus on safety, security, privacy, validity, transparency, explainability, and fairness. The concepts are based on NXP’s applications processors with integrated neural processing units (NPUs), as well as a dedicated, standalone NPU, with software enablement from NXP’s eIQ AI Toolkit.\n\nStory Continues\n“At GE HealthCare, we build AI that keeps clinicians at the center, assisting clinical judgment and freeing up time for patient care,” said Jeff Caron, Chief Digital & Technology Officer, Patient Care Solutions, GE HealthCare. “Collaborating with NXP helps us explore secure on-device AI as a complement to our cloud solutions, with concepts designed to support care teams in acute settings.”\n\n“This collaboration brings together GE HealthCare’s clinical trust and decades of medical technology innovation with NXP’s eIQ AI enablement and deep experience in secure, high-performance edge computing to provide safe, secure, and practical edge AI solutions to clinicians and patients,” said Charles Dachs, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Secure Connected Edge, NXP. “Together, we aim to enable more personalized care, from continuous monitoring in the NICU and hands-free interaction with anesthesia equipment to exploratory research concepts such as AI-driven risk prediction, automated triage, and personalized treatment recommendations.”\nGE HealthCare and NXP will demonstrate these two concepts at CES 2026 in NXP’s Pavilion (Central Plaza #134).

      "Content": "Quick Read Apple shares dropped 7% from their December peak following an analyst downgrade and seasonal weakness.\nRaymond James downgraded Apple to neutral citing stretched valuation and priced-in iPhone strength.\nA Siri AI overhaul and foldable iPhone are underrated drivers.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus\n\nFor Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) shareholders, it feels like Groundhog Day (the start of 2025 all over again), with a fresh, big-name analyst downgrade served up on the new year's first day of trading. Undoubtedly, a slew of analyst downgrades helped nudge shares of Apple into a rough trough in the first half of last year.\nAnd while one analyst downgrade does not necessarily mean a wave will follow as trading volumes pick up now that traders are back from their holiday break, I do think that investors may wish to get ready for increased turbulence as we enter a period of seasonal sluggishness. In many ways, the current climate feels eerily similar to that one Apple navigated at this time last year. And if more downgrades come flowing in, perhaps the first half of 2026 might be a bit of a doozy for the iPhone maker.\n\nIt's too easy to be negative on Apple at the start of 2026 Undoubtedly, it's all too easy to be negative on Apple in January, given we're quite a long way from the next iPhone keynote and there are timelier Magnificent Seven stocks to pursue as we head into the chilliest part of winter. With no Santa Claus rally this year and a bit of sell-side negativity regarding Apple to ring in the new year, perhaps it's time to be a buyer rather than a seller now that Apple shares have shed close to 7% from their December peak.\n\nOf course, the January slump could accelerate as investors look past the strong iPhone 17 sales to end 2025, the surprise potential from the holiday season, as well as the big Gemini-fuelled Siri overhaul that looms this Spring.\nPerhaps such positives are easy to overlook, given the rather lofty valuation (35.9 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E)) going into the year, the production cut on Apple Vision Pro, recent churn in upper management, and uncertainties as to whether CEO Tim Cook will retire this year. All considered, it certainly feels uneasy to put new money into shares of Apple to start off 2026, even if it's mostly rumors that traders are going by.\nWith shares dipping around 1.4% on Monday's session on a day that tech stocks saw a swift recovery, it feels like Apple stock is destined for another year of market-trailing results, even with the catalysts (Siri AI overhaul and new products) that might work their way into the stock sooner rather than later.\n\nStory Continues\nRaymond James' Apple downgrade might add to recent volatility in shares Raymond James doesn't seem to think there's all too much upside left in the Cupertino giant in the new year, even with big AI features just a few months out. The firm has a Market Perform rating (the equivalent of a neutral), down from Outperform. What's behind the downgrade? A stretched valuation, priced-in iPhone strength, the potential for slower sales growth, and skepticism over the looming AI catalyst, as well as the coming foldable iPhone.\n\nWhile there's no arguing that Apple stock goes for a premium relative to historical averages, I think it's a mistake to discount the impact of the Siri overhaul and its impact on device upgrades through the year. If the Siri upgrade goes well, I think it could power Apple stock to big surprises through the year. Additionally, it's too early in the game to count the foldable iPhone out of the game.\nCould the new form factor be a flop like the ultra-thin iPhone Air? There's definitely the possibility. And while foldable smartphones represent a small slice of the market, I would look for Apple to change that, especially if its foldable proves miles better than what currently exists.\nWhy the foldable iPhone could be a game-changer Either way, I think it's clear that consumers want more firepower and features from their devices, rather than something that's simply thinner and lighter with compromises. When it comes to the foldable, I see it as a device that could help kick off one of the strongest upgrade cycles in years.\n\nA foldable iPhone isn't just a new, more easily recognized kind of status symbol (unfold your new iPhone and everyone will see you've got the latest and greatest); it's a powerful form factor that may very well mark the next big jump as consumers gravitate towards bigger screens with fewer compromises.\nNotably, foldables tend to have a reputation for being fragile, quite thick, with screen creases, and less-than-ideal interfaces. The foldable iPhone has been hard at work to make a device that's better than what exists on the market. And if Apple can ship a durable, relatively thin device with a creaseless screen and an intuitive interface, I think foldables could reach an inflection point.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus If you spend a good amount on Amazon, this card could easily put $100s back in your pocket every year .

Huang showcased Nvidia's next-generation AI chip platform called Rubin, which uses chips supporting a wide range of applications, from model creation and training to enabling robotics and self-driving cars.\nWedbush analysts told clients after the event that it underscored how robotics and self-driving could present another market opportunity for Nvidia to \"tap into,\" and that they believe the new avenues could help Nvidia's market capitalization rise to $6 trillion over time, from its current level near $4.7 trillion.\nWhy This Matters to Investors Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company by providing most of the hardware behind the artificial intelligence boom. Staying at the forefront of the chipmaking space is important for Nvidia's stock, while competitors like AMD work to prove their own technology can compete with Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia said its AI-powered driver assistance software will be used in a new Mercedes-Benz car available later this year. Analysts have previously suggested Nvidia could be a key beneficiary of the rise of self-driving robotaxis.\nSu's Monday evening keynote also highlighted AMD's newest chips for data centers as well as physical AI applications like robotics.\nNvidia shares climbed about 2% in recent trading, while AMD slipped 2% after both stocks posted small declines on Monday.\nRead the original article on Investopedia",

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nA similar pattern emerged in the UK, Europe's second-largest plug-in car market, where data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed BYD moved ahead of Tesla in September and finished the year with 51,422 registrations, compared with Tesla's 45,513. Chinese automakers have made notable inroads in Britain, which has not followed the European Union in imposing tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, and their lower pricing has possibly helped push total UK new-car sales above 2 million units last year. This dynamic has drawn investor attention to how policy differences may influence market share outcomes.\n\nThese European developments follow Tesla relinquishing its position as the world's top EV seller after reporting a 16% decline in fourth-quarter deliveries and a second consecutive annual drop in sales, while BYD delivered 2.26 million EVs in 2025 versus Tesla's 1.64 million. At the same time, Tesla has faced intensifying competition in Europe from Volkswagen AG, Renault SA and BMW AG, alongside a consumer backlash linked to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's political activities. Together, these factors could continue shaping investor expectations for Tesla's regional performance as BYD expands overseas despite slower momentum at home amid scrutiny of discounting.",

Shares are down about 8% from their Oct. 29 peak, lagging the S&P 500, as concerns grow around how sustainable artificial intelligence spending could be and whether Nvidia can continue to dominate its market at the same scale. The pullback is notable given the stock had risen more than 1,300% since the end of 2022 at its recent high, with market value climbing past $5 trillion before roughly $460 billion was erased in the months that followed, even as shares rebounded 1% on Tuesday.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nCompetitive pressures are becoming more visible across the AI hardware landscape. Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) has secured large data-center orders from OpenAI and Oracle, while major Nvidia customers such as Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) are developing their own chips to reduce costs tied to Nvidia processors that can exceed $30,000 per unit. At the same time, demand for custom silicon has lifted Broadcom's valuation to about $1.6 trillion, overtaking Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ), and Nvidia has responded by licensing technology and hiring executives from Groq to incorporate lower-latency designs into future products. Even so, Bloomberg Intelligence suggests Nvidia's market share could remain largely intact as cloud providers continue to expand capital spending, which is projected to exceed $400 billion in 2026.\n\nDespite these risks, Nvidia continues to attract investor support due to its growth outlook and valuation. The company is projected to deliver 57% profit growth on a 53% increase in sales in its next fiscal year ending in January 2027, far ahead of peers such as Apple, while trading at about 25 times forward earnings, a discount to most of the so-called Magnificent Seven. Gross margins dipped in fiscal 2026 amid the Blackwell chip ramp but are expected to recover toward 75% in fiscal 2027, a key metric investors are watching closely. With most Wall Street analysts maintaining buy ratings and price targets implying further upside, Nvidia is still viewed by many as one of the faster-growing companies in public markets, even as the AI cycle faces heightened debate.",

Both companies are aggressively building toward an AI-native future and showing great success in their efforts, but which stock will reward its investors more?\n\nOracle is making investors nervous Oracle stumbled at the end of 2025 as investors began to question its ability to open more server farms for its partner, OpenAI, and reported less-than-impressive quarterly revenue and free cash flow. Oracle's debt load is growing, and the company has been slow in converting its large backlog.\nOracle's stock price is up over 17% in the past 12 months. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 30, which is slightly lower than Microsoft's forward P/E of just over 30. Microsoft's earnings per share are also almost three times those of Oracle.\nOracle's contracted backlog is impressive, at $523 billion; this is revenue that will eventually come to fruition. So much of Oracle's success, though, is tied to OpenAI. This is also a significant risk for investors. If it all goes right, the bets that Oracle is making now could pay off massively for investors.\n\nMicrosoft remains reliable Microsoft looks to be the more predictable and stable investment in the new AI era. The company is already a leader in the space as well as in cloud services, productivity, and gaming. Microsoft can leverage its existing infrastructure to remain relevant and grow over the next several years.\nAs of its most recent quarterly earnings, Microsoft reported double-digit growth in nearly all of its business channels, including a 40% year-over-year increase in Azure and other cloud services revenue.\n\nBoth stocks could potentially make an investor rich, but the execution risks within Oracle's strategy make Microsoft the more likely winner in a share-price-growing competition.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now?

      "Title": "Has Arm Holdings (ARM) Run Too Far After Recent Volatile Price Swings?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arm-holdings-arm-run-too-151458772.html",
      "Content": "If you are wondering whether Arm Holdings at around US$116 per share is priced fairly or not, you are not alone, many investors are asking the same question right now.\nThe stock has been volatile recently, with a 4.7% gain over the last 7 days, a 17.8% decline over the last 30 days, and returns of 1.2% year to date and a 19.6% decline over the last year.\nRecent headlines around Arm Holdings have focused on its role in the semiconductor ecosystem, as investors assess how its chip architecture is used across devices and data centers. This context has kept attention on how sentiment, licensing expectations, and sector conditions may be feeding into recent price moves.\nOn our valuation checks, Arm Holdings currently scores 0 out of 6 , which sets up an important question about how different valuation methods judge the stock today, and whether there is an even better way to think about value that we will come back to at the end of this article.\n\nArm Holdings scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Arm Holdings Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model takes the cash a business is expected to generate in the future and then discounts those projections back to today to estimate what the entire company might be worth right now.\nFor Arm Holdings, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach that is based on cash flow projections. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $1.29b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates see annual free cash flow figures in the next decade reaching into the range of around $1.67b in 2026 and $5.27b by 2030, with Simply Wall St extending analyst inputs beyond the first five years.\n\nWhen all of those projected cash flows are discounted back, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $63.12 per share, compared with the current share price of around US$116. On this model, that implies the stock is approximately 83.9% above the DCF estimate, which points to a rich valuation on cash flow terms today.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Arm Holdings may be overvalued by 83.9%. Discover 880 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Arm Holdings.\nApproach 2: Arm Holdings Price vs Earnings For a profitable company like Arm Holdings, the P/E ratio is a useful yardstick because it links what you pay today to the earnings the business is already generating. In general, higher growth expectations or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nStory Continues\nArm’s current P/E is about 148.4x, compared with the Semiconductor industry average of around 38.7x and a peer group average of about 39.2x. Simply Wall St also calculates a “Fair Ratio” of 52.1x, which is its proprietary view of what Arm’s P/E might be given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and key risks.\n\nThis Fair Ratio aims to improve on simple peer or industry comparisons by tailoring the multiple to Arm’s own profile rather than assuming all semiconductor companies should trade on similar terms. When you line up the Fair Ratio of 52.1x against the current P/E of 148.4x, the shares are screening as expensive on this earnings based check.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1454 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Arm Holdings Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St’s Community page you can use Narratives, which are short, clear stories that connect your view of Arm Holdings’ business to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and then to a Fair Value you can compare with today’s price so you can decide what to do. Each Narrative updates automatically as new earnings or news arrive. Different investors sometimes land on very different Fair Values, such as around US$56 at the cautious end and about US$210 at the optimistic end, all using the same company but different assumptions.\n\nFor Arm Holdings, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Arm Holdings Narratives:\nThese give you two clear, numbers based storylines to weigh against the DCF and P/E checks you have just seen.\n🐂 Arm Holdings Bull Case\nFair value: US$164.85 per share\nCurrent price vs this fair value: around 29.6% below the narrative fair value\nRevenue growth assumption: 22.13% a year\nFocuses on AI licensing and royalties as a key driver, with higher royalty rates on newer Arm platforms and wider use across data center, edge and IoT devices.\nAssumes rising profit margins toward about 30.8% and earnings of US$2.3b by around 2028, supported by a large developer ecosystem and expanded R&D.\nArrives at a fair value near US$165 and sees the analyst consensus price target of about US$152.59 as broadly in line with today’s price, while flagging execution, smartphone exposure and China as important risks to watch.\n\n🐻 Arm Holdings Bear Case\nFair value: US$70.00 per share\nCurrent price vs this fair value: around 65.9% above the narrative fair value\nRevenue growth assumption: 4.25% decline a year\nFrames Arm as a core part of global semiconductors but argues that recent trading in the US$120 to US$140 range reflects sentiment moving ahead of fundamentals.\nUses an earnings yield framework against the 10 year U.S. Treasury and sees fair value at about US$70, with a more conservative risk adjusted level of US$56.\nWarns that higher prices driven by AI enthusiasm and liquidity could leave little margin of safety and increase sensitivity to changes in interest rates, earnings delivery or risk appetite.\nTogether these Narratives bracket a wide range of outcomes around the same company, using explicit assumptions on growth, margins and valuation multiples so you can decide which story, if any, lines up with your own view.\nCurious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

      "Content": "Quick Read Meta Platforms ( META ) grew Q3 revenue 26% to $51.2B on strong ad demand. Meta issued $30B in bonds to fund $70B+ AI capex.\nMeta’s AI-powered Advantage+ ad campaigns generated $60B in annual run rate with $4.52 return per dollar spent.\nMeta cut Reality Labs spending by up to 30% after $70B+ in losses. Resources shifted to AI wearables like Ray-Ban smart glasses.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus\n\nMeta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) started off 2025 strong, posting 16% revenue growth in the first quarter to $42.3 billion. By the third quarter, revenue surged 26% year-over-year to $51.2 billion, driven by robust advertising demand. However, doubts emerged as Meta ramped up artificial intelligence (AI) investments, with capital expenditures expected to reach $70 billion to $72 billion for the year.\nTo fund this, Meta issued $30 billion in bonds in October, as free cash flow of $58.8 billion could no longer fully cover the outlays. Investors balked, fearing a repeat of the metaverse debacle, where Reality Labs racked up billions in losses. The stock, which had surged 66% off its tariff-induced lows in April, stalled and shares now sit 17% off those highs, just 12% above where they started in 2025.\n\nYet, this skepticism creates an opening for investors as Meta is poised to emerge as the unexpected AI leader in 2026.\nAI Boosting Ad Performance Meta has leveraged artificial intelligence to enhance its core advertising business, addressing challenges like the tumult caused by Apple 's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) privacy updates in 2021. AI-powered recommendation algorithms have improved ad relevance, leading to a 10% year-over-year increase in average price per ad in the third quarter. This has driven double-digit gains in conversion rates and pricing power.\n\nTools like Advantage+ campaigns, which automate targeting and creative generation, have generated over $60 billion in annual run rate, with advertisers seeing a $4.52 return per dollar spent. These advancements position Meta as an efficient AI player in digital advertising.\nTapping WhatsApp's Untapped Value WhatsApp, with over 2 billion users, represents a key growth asset for Meta. In 2025, the company introduced ads in the app's Status updates and Channels feature, including promoted search placements and subscriptions. Channel administrators can now charge monthly fees for exclusive content, with Meta taking a 10% cut. This builds on existing business tools, encouraging greater adoption as a commercial platform.\nAnalysts project these efforts could add significant revenue, with business messaging becoming a multi-billion-dollar stream. With per-message pricing adjustments and AI integration, WhatsApp's monetization is set to accelerate in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nImportantly, Meta is reducing spending in its Reality Labs division, which has incurred over $70 billion in losses since 2021. Executives planned cuts of up to 30% for the metaverse group in 2026, potentially including layoffs and project halts. This shift reallocates resources from virtual worlds like Horizon to AI wearables, such as smart glasses. Third-quarter 2025 operating losses were $4.4 billion, down slightly year-over-year, but still a drain. The move aims to curb inefficiencies while maintaining focus on profitable innovations.\n\nMoreover, Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have seen strong demand, with sales tripling in the first half of 2025 compared to the prior year. New models, including those with displays and AI features like real-time translation, launched in late 2025. Shipments of AI glasses are projected to reach 4 million units in 2025, capturing about 80% market share. This success in wearables provides a hardware platform for AI experiences, differentiating Meta from pure software competitors.\nValuation Hints at Opportunity Meta's stock trades at a forward P/E of around 22, with a PEG ratio near 1.5, reflecting expected earnings growth. This metric suggests the market undervalues its potential relative to peers. Analysts forecast revenue of approximately $235 billion in 2026, implying about 18% growth, and it follows the 21% expansion Wall Street expects for 2025. Management is looking for fourth-quarter revenue to come in a range between $56 billion and $59 billion, implying 19% to 22% growth.\n\nThis puts analysts' full-year expectations in line with Meta's forecasts, based on growth driven by AI-enhanced ads and new monetization opportunities from WhatsApp and Threads.\nKey Takeaway Meta's AI strategy carries risks, especially if the boom stalls due to economic pressures or regulatory scrutiny. Nothing grows forever, as we've seen with other technological innovations course correcting at some point, and Meta faces intense competition and cash flow pressure from its capital spending plan. Expenditures are expected to significantly rise in 2026.\n\nYet, as the earnings reports of the chipmakers indicate, there is no slowdown over the horizon and Meta is enjoying the benefits of accelerating ad revenue, WhatsApp monetization, and increasing momentum with wearables. With tools like cost reductions in Reality Labs and greater AI efficiencies, Meta Platforms seems perfectly positioned to surprise the market and become the sleeper AI winner in 2026.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus If you spend a good amount on Amazon, this card could easily put $100s back in your pocket every year .

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Cisco Systems (CSCO).\n\nCisco currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.90, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms.

      "Content": "The case study highlights how a strategic marketplace approach helped a leading hardware manufacturer thrive on Amazon Business amid surging demand for B2B e-commerce\nBELLEVUE, Wash., Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PJ Boren, a division of Forward Solutions, today published a new case study detailing how a leading hardware manufacturer grew its Amazon B2B business from 3.8% to 20% of total Amazon revenue while reducing chargeback penalties by more than 90%. The case study highlights how a data-driven marketplace strategy helped the manufacturer navigate the complexity of Amazon Business and unlock profitable growth amid accelerating B2B e-commerce demand.\n\nNavigating Amazon’s Marketplace Complexity\nWith PJ Boren’s support, the manufacturer analyzed Amazon sales data to identify high-performing products and prioritize B2B growth opportunities. The analysis revealed that multipack “put-up” bundles resonated with B2B buyers and materially increased item-level profitability. Next, the manufacturer established detailed B2B performance tracking against its total cost of goods sold (COGS). Guided by PJ Boren’s expertise, this tracking provided new visibility into how the B2B segment contributed to overall costs, allowing the company to fine-tune its Amazon program for maximum return.\nThe collaboration also reduced Amazon’s chargeback penalties by enforcing strict operational compliance, improved profitability, and freed capital to reinvest in growth initiatives such as Amazon advertising. These additional Amazon advertising investments led to an average annual growth rate of 53% in attributed sales.\n\nTogether, these initiatives improved profitability and accelerated B2B sales growth across the manufacturer’s Amazon business.\nThis focused optimization paid off. Over the course of the initiative, the manufacturer grew its B2B business from 3.8% to 20% of its total Amazon business. They also reduced Amazon’s chargeback penalties from 5.4% to 0.4% over 5 years, resulting in an average annual savings of $166,000. “Taking this strategic data-driven approach on Amazon Business was a complex but crucial step for their company,” said Jim Boren, President of PJ Boren. “They needed to tailor the product selection, put-ups, and pricing to attract more business buyers. By refining their marketplace approach and embracing digital tools, they significantly grew their B2B sales and reached customers they might never have served otherwise.”\n\nB2B Marketplaces Boom Amid Digital Sales Transformation\nThe manufacturer’s success comes as B2B e-commerce and online marketplaces rapidly accelerate. Gartner Research has predicted that 80% of B2B sales interactions between suppliers and buyers will take place through digital channels, signaling a fundamental shift in how organizations purchase. Business buyers now expect the same seamless online experience they enjoy as consumers, pushing procurement decisively toward digital platforms.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon Business, the B2B marketplace featured in this case study, illustrates this transformation. According to Amazon, the platform now serves more than 6 million business customers worldwide and generates approximately $35 billion in annual sales. Industry analysts further estimate that Amazon’s B2B marketplace could reach $80 billion in gross sales by the end of the decade. In the U.S., research shows that over 57% of B2B buyers purchase through Amazon Business, underscoring the importance of online marketplaces in the procurement ecosystem.\n\nAs B2B buying shifts online, manufacturers can no longer rely solely on traditional sales channels. “For B2B companies, an effective e-commerce presence is no longer optional; it’s fundamental to growth,” noted Jim Boren, President of PJ Boren. This case demonstrates how a marketplace optimization strategy can unlock new revenue streams while maintaining balance with existing sales models. By embracing marketplace complexity and aligning with evolving buyer expectations, manufacturers can use platforms like Amazon Business to enhance, not disrupt, their core B2B sales strategy.\nFind out how PJ Boren can help you sell on Amazon.

As I said, we'll broaden it out in a moment, but what to you was most significant? Because in, you know, Jensen Wong is very good at painting these grand visions. What did investors most want to hear from him and did he deliver?\n00:29 Speaker B\nHi Julie, thanks for having me on the show. So, um, I think, you know, what's what's most interesting here, uh, is to see an NVIDIA capable of rolling out six new chips, you know, like a CPU, a GPU, uh, networking switches, Ns. And that's illustrates, you know, the kind of co-design that's required to keep improving system level performance at that kind of pace, you know.\n01:03 Speaker B\nUm, NVIDIA is really synchronizing every year, multiple silicon and software building plugs, and the whole unit of computing ends up landing together, working as expected, generation after generation. Um, and when these from land, uh, you know, NVIDIa is structurally the best placed vendor to sell you um the networking, uh systems that are validated to work with all of that on day one.\n01:29 Speaker B\nand that kind of integration, time to market and ecosystem strength really play together and that's what is feeding, you know, NVIDIa's market power today.\n01:32 Speaker A\nUm, Ivana, I want to turn to you though on this. Is this all though just sort of incremental or is it, you know, you know, what does NVIDIA need to do to keep this momentum going and can it just sort of do more of what it's been doing? Is that enough?\n01:54 Speaker C\nWell, I think it's enough, right? Because as long as the numbers are keep going up, there's going to be upside in the stock. From the event specifically, this was more of a check the box moment and making sure that they are delivering on the next generation platform. It seemed like everything was on track. Just for background, the shift from this generation is much simpler than when we were shifting from Hopper to Blackwell. So I think that should give investors some confidence that this transition goes smoothly.\n02:37 Speaker A\nAnd so, you know, when we're looking at the stock performance, um, you know, Antoine, I'll take it back to you, we're not seeing a heck of a lot of upside here this morning following these comments.\n02:51 Speaker B\nNo, I think, uh, I mean, we we've seen that for some time now, we, we, uh, NVIDIA has been, you know, trading, uh, on low 20s, you know, 2027, uh, earnings. And, uh, I think, you know, now investors are just concerned about how, uh, growth will normalize, you know, beyond 27. We have great visibility on 26. You know, hyper scalers have laid out their capx plans. Uh, it's consistent, you know, with the 500 billion of bookings that Jensen has been talking about.\n03:22 Speaker B\nBut now the key question is how how fast is CAPEX going to grow beyond 27? That's question number one that investors are concerned about. Question number two is, um, of course, the market is going to be so large that uh NVIDIA is going to have to make room for alternatives for 6 for AMD. And so the the other question is how much room is NVIDIA going to make? you know, and how much uh uh is NVIDIa's data center business going to grow, you know, as a result of CAPEX growing uh NVIDIa going to grow.\n03:47 Speaker B\nSo those are the the you know, the concerns that I think are waiting on the stock today.\n03:51 Speaker A\nIvana, if one of the things that Jensen said yesterday was that you know, they're trying to make chips more energy efficient, more cost effective, then why would CAPEX need to be, you know, wouldn't that imply a lower CAPEX is necessary?\n04:16 Speaker C\nNo, actually, it's kind of the opposite, right? Because basically, where we are sitting here today, uh, cost of per token are still extremely high. So, basically, the cost to use AI is extremely high, which is preventing a lot of this AI agents from gaining broad adoption. So, you're going to need a lot more compute at a much lower cost. So, that's basically why CAPEX numbers are going significantly higher, even though we're getting so much better performance.",

Johnson Controls, with data centers representing a low-double-digit percentage of total sales, appears most exposed among major HVAC providers.\n\nThe analyst identified Trane Technologies, with approximately 10% of sales from data centers, and Carrier Global, with roughly 5% exposure, as other companies that could face headwinds from reduced chiller intensity in future data center designs.\nThe news wasn’t negative for all companies in the sector. Mitchell noted that nVent Electric ( NVT ) could benefit from these developments as it has \"no presence in space cooling/chillers/air handling, but [does] have a decent position in datacenter liquid cooling.\" Vertiv Holdings ( VRT ) was also identified as potentially benefiting due to its \"strong historical position in precision air cooling\" and \"strong position in liquid cooling.\"\nRelated articles\nIs Nvidia disrupting HVAC?

      "Content": "If you are wondering whether Amazon.com is still priced attractively after its long run as a market favorite, this article will walk through how its current share price stacks up against different measures of value.\nAmazon.com shares last closed at US$233.06, with returns of 0.2% over the past week, 1.5% over the past month, 2.9% year to date, 4.9% over 1 year and 49.4% over 5 years, which gives you a sense of how the market has been reassessing the stock over different timeframes.\nRecent headlines have continued to focus on Amazon.com's scale across e commerce, cloud computing and its broader ecosystem, which keeps the company in the spotlight for both growth focused and value conscious investors. This ongoing attention provides important context for how investors think about what is already priced into the shares.\nOn Simply Wall St's valuation checks, Amazon.com scores 5 out of 6 for being undervalued. Next we will look at how different valuation approaches line up for the stock, and then finish with a way of thinking about value that goes beyond any single model.\n\nFind out why Amazon.com's 4.9% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\nApproach 1: Amazon.com Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to today to reflect risk and the time value of money.\nFor Amazon.com, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month free cash flow sits at about US$40.0b. Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates out to 2030, and Simply Wall St then extends those projections further. For example, projected free cash flow for 2030 is US$190.1b, with intermediate years such as 2026 and 2027 at US$44.6b and US$76.1b respectively, based on the supplied estimates and extrapolations.\n\nAfter discounting these future cash flows back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$376.04 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$233.06, this implies the shares trade at a 38.0% discount to that DCF estimate. On this model alone, the stock appears to be trading below that estimated intrinsic value.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Amazon.com is undervalued by 38.0%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 880 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Amazon.com.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: Amazon.com Price vs Earnings For profitable companies, the P/E ratio is a useful yardstick because it links what you pay for each share to the earnings that business is currently generating. It gives you a quick sense of how many dollars investors are willing to pay today for one dollar of earnings.\nWhat counts as a \"normal\" P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk. Higher expected earnings growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tends to point to a lower multiple.\n\nAmazon.com currently trades on a P/E of 32.6x. That sits above the Multiline Retail industry average of 19.4x but below the peer group average of 35.4x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” framework, which estimates what P/E might make sense for a company given factors like its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and key risks.\nThis Fair Ratio for Amazon.com is 40.5x, which is higher than the current 32.6x P/E. On this metric, the shares look undervalued relative to what the model suggests as a fair earnings multiple.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1454 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Amazon.com Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you set out your story for Amazon.com, link it to a financial forecast and estimated fair value, then compare that fair value to the current share price, all within an easy Community page tool that updates as new news or earnings arrive. This can reflect very different views, such as one Narrative valuing Amazon.com at US$450 per share based on an AI heavy investment story and another closer to US$217.95 that assumes more moderate growth and margins.\n\nFor Amazon.com, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Amazon.com Narratives:\n🐂 Amazon.com Bull Case\nFair value: US$234.75 per share\nImplied discount to this fair value: 0.7%\nRevenue growth assumption: 13.6%\nViews recent share price moves after 2Q25 as an opportunity, with a detailed review of Amazon's e commerce, AWS, advertising and devices footprint.\nHighlights a long list of recent AWS customer wins, product launches and AI related initiatives across cloud, robotics and satellite connectivity.\nSets out explicit multi year price projections based on growth rate assumptions, while acknowledging they do not fully capture potential upside from pipeline projects.\n🐻 Amazon.com Bear Case\nFair value: US$227.14 per share\n\nImplied premium to this fair value: 2.6%\nRevenue growth assumption: 9%\nSplits Amazon into two sides: a higher margin group made up of AWS, advertising and subscriptions, and a lower margin, high volume retail and third party seller operation.\nAssumes the higher margin segments carry stronger growth and profitability, while the retail engine grows at a steadier pace with limited margin expansion.\nBrings those strands together into a view of future revenues and earnings, and uses that to arrive at a fair value that sits close to the current share price.\nBetween these two previews you can see how different investors can look at the same company, use different growth and margin assumptions and end up with fair values that bracket where Amazon.com trades today. That contrast can be a useful prompt to review your own expectations before you decide what to do with the stock.\nCurious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ab04a7af-51b9-38de-8320-0b88196b0f9e/why-amazon%E2%80%99s-spending-spree.html",
      "Content": "AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nQuick Read Amazon ( AMZN ) free cash flow dropped 69% to $14.8B as capital spending surged to $89.9B year-to-date. Amazon stock rose only 6% in 2025.\nAmazon AWS grew 20% to $33B in Q3 revenue with 34.6% operating margins. Advertising services expanded 24% to $17.7B.\nAmazon projected $125B capex for 2025 focused on AI infrastructure and data centers. Management indicated spending will increase further in 2026.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus\n\nFor investors in Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), 2025 proved to be a lackluster year. The stock only rose about 5%, trailing the S&P 500 's 16% advance and also lagging most of its Magnificent 7 peers, including Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), which gained just 8%.\nThis underperformance stemmed from concerns over Amazon's heavy capital spending and slowing cash flow generation. Yet, beyond a simple reversal of fortunes, the strategic investments position it for strong gains in 2026 as these efforts begin to yield results.\nHeavy Spending Pressures Cash Flow Amazon's free cash flow has faced ongoing declines amid aggressive investments. In the third quarter, trailing 12-month free cash flow dropped to $14.8 billion, down 69% from $47.7 billion a year earlier. This followed a slide from $18.2 billion in the second quarter, driven by a $50.9 billion year-over-year increase in property and equipment purchases. Cash capital expenditures reached $34.2 billion in Q3 alone, with $89.9 billion spent year-to-date.\n\nAmazon’s capex spending ebbs and flows over time, marked by periods when its pouring money into new investments followed by phases of contraction where it waits for (and often sees) a payoff. During the heavy spending periods -- such as the early years when it was building out AWS -- spending ramped up to drive innovation and market leadership. Investors have seen signs for the past year that indicate Amazon has entered a new cycle -- it could be its biggest yet -- as AI becomes central to its strategy.\nAlthough this has weighed heavily on Amazon's performance, the trend may continue into the fourth quarter when it reports results later this month, as full-year cash capex is projected at $125 billion for 2025, a significant jump from prior levels. Management has indicated capex will rise even more in 2026 to support its expanding infrastructure needs.\n\nWhy Amazon's Cash Burn Signals Strength Despite the cash flow squeeze, this spending is not a red flag but a deliberate strategy to fuel future growth. The bulk of capex -- around $125 billion in 2025 -- targets Amazon Web Services expansion, data centers, and AI infrastructure. This includes billions allocated to custom silicon like Trainium 2 chips, which have already generated billions of dollars in revenue and grown 150% sequentially in Q3. Trainium 3, which was released in December, promises 4.4 times higher compute performance and 40% lower energy use.\n\nStory Continues\nHistorically, similar investment cycles have paid off handsomely. Past capex surges built AWS into a profit powerhouse, now with a $132 billion annualized run rate. Analysts project the AI cloud market to hit $647 billion by 2030. AWS holds a 32% share of the global cloud infrastructure services market where most of the AI workloads occur, though Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) is often seen as the leader in the AI cloud because of its partnership with OpenAI. Still, Amazon benefits from extensive enterprise ties and integrations like Bedrock for AI models. As AI demand shifts from training to inference, Amazon's vertical control over hardware could protect margins and drive revenue.\n\nHigh-Margin Businesses Drive Momentum Amazon's revenue mix underscores its potential. In Q3, total revenue hit $180.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. AWS led with $33 billion in sales, up 20% -- its fastest growth in 11 quarters -- and $11.4 billion in operating income, yielding a 34.6% margin. Advertising services grew 24% to $17.7 billion quarterly, on pace for substantial annual expansion with margins over 50%.\n\nSubscription services, including Prime, added $12.6 billion, while third-party seller services reached $42.5 billion. Amazon's high-margin segments now comprise nearly 60% of revenue, growing faster than the low-margin retail side. Meanwhile, retail efficiency is improving through robotics deployment in fulfillment centers, boosting profitability in logistics.\nAmazon trades at about 29 times 2026 estimated earnings and 19 times trailing operating cash flow of $130.7 billion. This appears reasonable for a company expecting double-digit revenue growth, backed by $200 billion in AWS performance obligations over 3.8 years.\nKey Takeaway With tailwinds like AWS reacceleration, advertising expansion, and its AI infrastructure maturing, Amazon is set to reap rewards from its capex outlays. The investments lay groundwork for sustained dominance in cloud and e-commerce, turning its current pressures into 2026 gains.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus If you spend a good amount on Amazon, this card could easily put $100s back in your pocket every year .

      "Content": "Zenity makes it easy for customers to easily implement full-lifecycle security and governance for AI agents by consolidating purchases through AWS\nNEW YORK, January 06, 2026 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Zenity, the leading security and governance platform for AI agents, today announced it is now available on AWS Marketplace , making it easier for enterprises to deploy full-lifecycle protection for AI agents built on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and across their broader AI estates. The listing follows Zenity’s recent launch of native support for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, which was featured onstage during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s keynote at re:Invent. Zenity’s platform provides customers with deep visibility, policy-driven governance, and real-time runtime protection for the agents powering their most critical workloads across cloud, SaaS, endpoints, and agentic browsers .\n\nAmazon Bedrock AgentCore gives developers a powerful foundation for building long‑running, tool‑rich, memory‑aware agents that act across identity, data, and applications. As enterprises rapidly experiment and deploy these agents, they face a growing challenge: understanding what agents exist, what they can do, and how to stop them from doing the wrong thing, all without slowing innovation. By partnering directly with Amazon, Zenity is addressing this gap by connecting build‑time configuration with live runtime telemetry, allowing security and platform teams to discover agents, understand behavior and intent, and enforce guardrails consistently across AWS and other platforms.\n\"With AgentCore, Amazon is making it dramatically easier for enterprises to go beyond theory and create AI agents that actually get work done,\" said Ben Kliger, CEO and co-founder of Zenity. \"Our role is to help AWS build a platform where enterprises can adopt these tools at scale, responsibly, with the confidence that agents are operating within clear security and compliance boundaries.\"\n\nZenity’s agent-centric platform gives customers:\nEnd-to-end visibility and observability into agents that are built and deployed in AgentCore and beyond , including which agents exist, what tools and data they use, and how they behave in production.\nReal-time detection and prevention of unsafe behaviors , such as indirect prompt injection, unauthorized memory access, or misuse of privileged tools and services.\nDeterministic control over agent actions , ensuring agents cannot perform unsafe or unsanctioned operations, even as behaviors, prompts, and integrations evolve.\nFrictionless fit into AWS developer workflows , enabling builders to keep using AgentCore the way they want, while security teams gain the observability, guardrails, and policy enforcement they require.\n\nStory Continues\n\"Enterprises are adopting and building agents that read emails, move money, change configurations, and touch customer data,\" Kliger added. \"Those agents are where business value is created and where risk shows up first. By being on AWS Marketplace and integrating deeply with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, we’re making it so simple for customers to turn on the same level of security discipline for agents that they already expect for applications and infrastructure.\"\n\nBeyond Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Zenity helps organizations secure agents that are used in SaaS, cloud, homegrown, endpoint, and agent browsers. This cross‑environment visibility and enforcement is increasingly critical as security leaders look to manage AI agent risk with a unified, programmatic approach instead of fragmented point controls.\nZenity is available today on AWS Marketplace, allowing customers to quickly procure and deploy the platform using existing AWS commercial relationships. For more information and to access the listing, visit Zenity’s listing on AWS Marketplace .\nAbout Zenity\nZenity is the first security and governance platform purpose-built for AI agents - spanning SaaS, home grown platforms (Cloud), and end-user devices (Endpoint). Trusted by Fortune 500 enterprises, Zenity helps security teams confidently adopt AI by delivering defense in depth with full-lifecycle coverage: from agent discovery and posture management to real-time detection, inline prevention, and response. With an agent-centric approach that prioritizes how agents behave, what they access, and which tools they invoke, Zenity eliminates blind spots and enforces consistent policy and controls across environments so organizations can innovate with AI, without compromising security.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -14.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Broadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $2.02 per share, indicating a change of +26.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.9% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +44.6%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +18.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Broadcom Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Broadcom Inc., the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.22 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +28.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $93.48 billion and $134.26 billion estimates indicate +46.3% and +43.6% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Broadcom Inc. reported revenues of $18.02 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.2%. EPS of $1.95 for the same period compares with $1.42 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.94%. The EPS surprise was +4.28%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

      "Content": "^GSPC\n\nTesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this electric car maker have returned +2.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has gained 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nTesla is expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.8%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.62 points to a change of -33.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.9%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.31 indicates a change of +42.4% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.8%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Tesla.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -3.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $94.76 billion and $105.75 billion estimates indicate -3% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Tesla reported revenues of $28.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.6%. EPS of $0.5 for the same period compares with $0.72 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was -5.66%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla.

And look, it took the internet decades to reach that same milestone.\n00:20 Speaker A\nNow, what we are projecting is even more amazing.\n00:24 Speaker A\nWe see the adoption of AI growing to over 5 billion active users as AI truly becomes indispensable to every part of our lives,\n00:34 Speaker A\njust like the cell phone and the internet of today.\n00:39 Speaker A\nNow, the foundation of AI is compute.\n00:42 Speaker A\nWith all of that user growth, we have seen a huge surge in demand in the global compute infrastructure,\n00:48 Speaker A\ngrowing from about one Z flop in 2022 to more than 100 Z flops in 2025.\n00:56 Speaker A\nNow that sounds big, that's actually 100 times in just a few years.\n01:03 Speaker A\nBut what you're going to hear tonight from everyone is we won't have, we don't have nearly enough compute for everything that we can possibly do.\n01:09 Speaker A\nWe have incredible innovation happening. Models are becoming much more capable.\n01:13 Speaker A\nThey're thinking and reasoning, they're making better decisions, and that goes even further when we extend that to agents overall.\n01:23 Speaker A\nSo to enable AI everywhere, we need to increase the world's compute capacity another hundred times over the next few years to more than 10 yota flops over the next five years.\n01:34 Speaker A\nNow, let me take a survey. How many of you know what a yotta flop is?\n01:40 Speaker A\nRaise your hand, please.\n01:44 Speaker A\nA yottaflop is a one followed by 24 zeros.\n01:52 Speaker A\nSo 10 yotaflops is 10,000 times more compute than we had in 2022.\n01:59 Speaker A\nThere's just never ever ever been anything like this in the history of computing.\n02:05 Speaker A\nAnd that's really because there's never been a technology like AI.",

      "Title": "Waymo’s Robo-Taxi Lead Widens as Tesla Plays Catch-Up in the Autonomous Race",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/aad07b79-5461-3707-b199-65b921a61d11/waymo%E2%80%99s-robo-taxi-lead-widens.html",
      "Content": "GOOG\n\nQuick Read Waymo’s real-world advantage in miles driven and cities approved gives Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) a material lead over Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) in autonomous ride-hailing deployment.\nRegulatory approval for robo-taxis remains a city-by-city process, favoring companies with longer operating histories and broader municipal relationships.\nWaymo’s platform-agnostic strategy allows partnerships with multiple global automakers, potentially accelerating adoption beyond Tesla’s single-brand ecosystem.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus\n\nWatch the Video Our conversation began with what some have treated as a sensational headline, a temporary Waymo disruption during a San Francisco power outage. Lee and I agreed almost immediately that this was noise rather than signal, and that the real story lies in how far ahead Waymo already is in the autonomous driving race.\n\nMiles driven and cities conquered I opened by emphasizing what matters most in autonomous vehicles today: miles driven and cities conquered. Waymo has logged millions more autonomous miles than Tesla and operates in multiple cities where regulatory approvals have already been secured. That matters because robo-taxis are not approved nationally. Each city represents a separate regulatory hurdle, and Waymo has already cleared far more of them.\n\nLee agreed that while Tesla’s technology continues to improve, Waymo’s experience advantage is substantial. These systems learn from edge cases, and the company with the most real-world data holds a powerful edge that cannot be replicated overnight.\nRegulation favors the incumbent We also discussed how misunderstood the regulatory process is among investors. Autonomous driving is a local gamble. Cities and municipalities decide whether these vehicles operate on their streets, not federal agencies issuing blanket approvals. That reality strongly favors Waymo, which has already built trust with regulators and local governments.\n\nWhile Tesla’s system is vehicle-centric and tied exclusively to Tesla cars, Waymo operates independently of manufacturing. That distinction could prove critical as the market scales.\nThe Android versus iOS analogy I made the case that Waymo is effectively positioning itself as the Android of the auto industry. Tesla’s autonomous software works only within its own vehicles, similar to Apple’s closed ecosystem. Waymo, by contrast, can partner with multiple manufacturers, opening the door to rapid global adoption across brands and continents.\nLee agreed that this flexibility is likely to accelerate worldwide deployment, especially among automakers looking to remain competitive without building their own full-stack autonomous systems.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestment implications We closed by tying the discussion back to Alphabet’s broader investment case. Waymo is just one component of a company that continues to execute across multiple growth vectors. Lee pointed out that Alphabet, along with Nvidia, has been one of the few mega-cap technology companies outperforming the S&P 500 this year, reinforcing why it remains a core long-term holding for both of us.\n\nTesla may still succeed in autonomy, but at this point in the race, Waymo is ahead on the metrics that matter most.\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: So Lee, it's sort of old news that a bunch of these Waymo, robo taxis stopped working in San Francisco, when there was a power failure. Listen, I think these things aren't ready for prime time. I don't think the Tesla's ready. I, I would say the most important thing to look at right now is Waymo has a huge headstart right now over Tesla and it is what I call miles driven, cities conquered. That's what I call, right?\n\n[00:00:34] Lee Jackson: Right.\n[00:00:34] Doug McIntyre: They've driven many, many times the miles that Tesla has in the millions. As a matter of fact, they're in two or three times as many cities.\n[00:00:44] People need to remember something, robo vehicles are a local gamble because these things are approved locally. Right. You, can't call the transportation department and say, I've got the greatest Woo. I got an auto drive system. You're gonna love it. Yep.\n[00:01:02] Lee Jackson: Right, right.\n[00:01:05] Doug McIntyre: So if I have to make a bet right now, listen, both could do well.\n[00:01:10] If I want to bet on the horse that's ahead, I'm betting on Waymo. I'm betting on\n[00:01:14] Lee Jackson: Well, yeah. And clearly this is a tech issue that will be quickly resolved. It was just an embarrassing thing for, for the Tesla robos to be working fine in, in the blackout in San Fran and the Waymo's were stuck at lights, or lights that were out.\n\n[00:01:31] But yeah, I think in the, in, in the bigger picture, they have a big lead and, it'll be interesting to see if this even stays around, what happened or if it'll just be a non-issue going forward.\n[00:01:45] Doug McIntyre: Their engineers have fixed it by now, I'll bet.\n[00:01:48] Lee Jackson: Oh, I'm, I, would suspect they have or they've been fired.\n[00:01:52] And new engineers are fixing it. But yeah, I agree.\n[00:01:55] Doug McIntyre: I think this is a shame that the press does this, but when you look at new technologies, car technologies, particularly EVs and automatic, self-driving, they always decide they're gonna go for the sensational story. Not understanding that these things have been driven tens of millions of miles.\n\n[00:02:12] It's look right. Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, they're all into this thing that the tech, the cyber truck and some of the Tesla cars have these automatic, electric doors and one or two of them didn't open in a fire and people got killed. I get it. If you said to me today, would you rather drive in the back of a car with one of your sisters driving, or in a Tesla or Waymo vehicle for the rest of your life? I would pick the Tesla or Waymo vehicle there. Listen there, I understand that if you've got a guy who drives in the Indy 500, it may or may not be safer, but for the most part, I would much, much rather have a non-human AI a powered car.\n[00:03:02] Lee Jackson: Well, and, you don't have to listen to some cab driver from, or Uber driver from who knows where, but yeah, I agree.\n\n[00:03:11] And Waymo is way ahead and that's just yet another reason why Alphabet remains your favorite and my favorite tech stock because it seems like everything that they're doing, they seem to be hitting on all sectors and I think we've told people this, that the only two mag sevens, that are outperforming the s and p 500 this year are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet.\n[00:03:36] The rest of 'em are underperforming. So it's just like, well let's stick with the big boy. And maybe that's why Warren Buffet bought it, like we discussed.\n[00:03:45] Doug McIntyre: Well, there's one last thing I like about Waymo. Tesla's, AI, self-driving car works on one kind of car, right? Right. Yeah. The Waymo partnerships could be with many, many, many car companies.\n\n[00:04:02] Waymo does not build its own car. So the idea that they could partner with somebody that's a really big manufacturer and get broad distribution, they could do that with more than one car company.\n[00:04:15] Lee Jackson: Absolutely, they could. Absolutely.\n[00:04:17] Doug McIntyre: It's like Android. Okay. It's like Android and iOS. Right? iOS only works on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) products.\n[00:04:23] Right. Android works on every other smartphone. Yep. I'm gonna say this, I'm gonna be the first person to ever say this in the history Waymo. Okay. Is the Android of the automobile industry.\n[00:04:40] Lee Jackson: I don't think a lot of people will put it in that position, but I think you're exactly right because it will be.\n\n[00:04:48] And that's not just the American domestic car companies, it's the car companies around the world.\n[00:04:51] Doug McIntyre: No, that's my point. Yes.\n[00:04:53] Lee Jackson: Yeah. And it's a good point because it's gonna be probably, a much faster adoption worldwide because the other one has to be in a Tesla. So Yeah, that's an outstanding point.\n[00:05:06] Doug McIntyre: If you're the losers who run Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) , how fast do you want to use that Waymo technology?\n[00:05:11] Lee Jackson: Not so fast. It's ridiculous. I know. Yeah. Alright, well, we'll leave it at that. But my goodness. Yeah. I have not done this yet, so I'm kind of excited about getting in one of these at a Waymo at one point and see how it goes.\n\n[00:05:25] They'll have 'em in Mississippi soon. Okay.\nAmazon Prime members: Do not miss this bonus If you spend a good amount on Amazon, this card could easily put $100s back in your pocket every year .

( NASDAQ:AMD ) is pressing its case to investors that the AI hardware cycle may still have significant room to run, using the CES stage to outline both near-term product launches and a longer-dated roadmap aimed at enterprise data centers. Speaking during the keynote, Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su introduced the MI440X, a new accelerator designed for smaller corporate data centers that prefer on-premise deployments, while also emphasizing the capabilities of the higher-end MI455X, which she said represents a step forward in data center AI performance. Su argued that demand for compute could remain strong as AI use cases expand, noting that innovation has moved quickly in recent years and suggesting the industry may still be early in addressing the full scale of potential workloads.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AMD.\nIs AMD fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAMD is widely viewed as Nvidia's ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) closest competitor in AI accelerators, having built a multibillion-dollar business around these products over the past couple of years, and the company is under pressure from investors to show progress in winning a greater share of industry spending. Su highlighted that systems based on the MI455X and the company's new Venice CPU design, branded as the Helios system, are expected to go on sale later this year, positioning AMD to participate more directly in large-scale AI deployments. She was joined on stage by OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who discussed the partnership between the two companies and their shared view that future economic growth could be closely linked to access to AI computing resources.\n\nLooking further out, Su also previewed AMD's next generation of accelerators, the MI500 series, which she said is slated to debut in 2027 and could deliver up to 1,000 times the performance of the MI300 series that first rolled out in 2023. The MI440X, she added, is designed to fit into more compact systems within existing smaller data centers, broadening AMD's reach beyond hyperscale customers. Together, the announcements were positioned as part of a longer-term effort by AMD to expand its AI footprint and potentially capture a larger slice of a market that has so far been dominated by Nvidia.",

The machine has become a gatekeeper of human activity in many ways.\n\nMac Greer: That was NYU professor Vasant Dhar, author of the new book, Thinking With Machines, The Brave New World of AI. I'm Motley Fool Producer Mac Greer. Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma recently talked with Professor Dhar about that brave new world.\nAsit Sharma: Greetings, Fools. I'm Asit Sharma, Senior Analyst and Lead Advisor at the Motley Fool. My guest today is Vasant Dhar, Robert A Miller Professor of Business at NYU's Stern School of Business. Professor Dhar is a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. In fact, he received his PhD from the University of Pittsburgh with a specialization in artificial intelligence in 1984. Among his many achievements, Professor Dhar is noted for bringing machine learning to Morgan Stanley's proprietary trading groups in the 1990s. You may have listened to the professor's popular Brave New World podcast, and he's out with a new book entitled, Thinking With Machines, The Brave New World of AI, which is the topic of today's discussion. Vasant Dhar, welcome to the Motley Fool.\n\nStory Continues\nVasant Dhar: Thank you, Asit. Delighted to be a Fool.\nAsit Sharma: Awesome. I wanted to start with your early childhood, which you recount in the introduction to Thinking With Machines. You were born in the 1950s in Kashmir, India, and you note that you rode to school in a horse drawn cart. You also moved around quite a bit in India, and by the time you were nine, your father was posted to Ethiopia on assignment as India's military attache to Africa. I wondered, Professor, can you tell us a little bit about these formative experiences and how they helped shape the person and scholar you became?\n\nVasant Dhar: All amazing experiences growing up, including what you mentioned in Ethiopia. I described this in my book in a humorous incident. My mother put me in the wrong grade. She put me in seventh grade instead of fourth grade by mistake and only realized her error six months later when it was too late to do anything about it. Here I was hanging around in class with 15, 16 year olds and I was like nine. That was a hell of an experience growing up. Then I went off to boarding school in India after that, which was also another so my trajectory was third grade, seventh grade, eighth grade, and then 6, 7, 8. You cannot make this up. That's what it happened. But it made me resilient, I guess, in some way, and it was a really unusual upbringing. I'm happy for it.\n\nAsit Sharma: Fast forward to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at a time where you were attending school and intersecting with a very exciting world, the very nascent world of artificial intelligence. You met an AI pioneer in Herbert Simon, who had received the Nobel Prize in economics for his work in revealing the limits of human rationality and decision making. Professor, I remember still in the early 90s, late 80s, early 90s, taking a college class in microeconomics in which rationality was still the governing principle or said to be the governing principle by which most humans make their economic decisions.\nVasant Dhar: That's right.\nAsit Sharma: But Professor Simon had a different idea. He called it bounded rationality. I wondered if you could explain that to us.\n\nVasant Dhar: Essentially, what he said was that humans have limited cognitive resources that we are not able to enumerate all possible alternatives and evaluate them. That's just too taxing. We'd never get through the day if we did that and that our attention is limited, and then we tend to focus on the most plausible things to pursue and we do this through heuristics, that I learned through experience and so heuristics, actually focus our attention to the right parts of the problem. When we find an acceptable choice, we take it and we move on. That was his theory, which was called bounded rationality. I have to say that economists said, \"Yeah, that's true, but let's just move on\". For the most part they still because it doesn't lead to very good theories, it messes up nice mathematical model.\n\nAsit Sharma: It's messy.\nVasant Dhar: It's messy, and economists don't like that. It was just, \"Yes, it's true, but thank you very much\". Whereas his ideas really took root in artificial intelligence which was really about, at that time, all about how do you represent knowledge and how do you traverse it intelligently and that was called heuristic search at the time. Heuristics became big in AI, and they were the primary paradigm at that time of expert systems where we tried to build these impressive applications in areas like medicine where you would extract knowledge from experts and use the heuristics that they require through experience to actually do medical diagnosis. That was my first real experience to AI, just watching this system called internist interact with an expert and elicit information and arrive at the correct differential diagnosis. I was just watching this, and it just blew my mind and that's when I decided, This is what I'd like to do with my life.\n\nAsit Sharma: You posit that oftentimes, success in the markets or in other probabilistic endeavors is made up of small edges that compound, compounding small edges and you bring up the commencement address of tennis great Roger Federer last year to the graduating class of Dartmouth. Can you start with what interested you in that commencement address and explain the concept of compounding edges to us, please.\nVasant Dhar: The statistic that Federer said that really stayed with me and it's so similar to financial markets I view financial markets and sports as being two sides of the same coin. He said, \"Over the course of 1,526 matches, I won 80% of them. What percentage of points do you think I won?\" He paused and he says, \"54%\", barely better than even. In financial markets, you do 54%, you should be banned managing the world's money, as long as you're winners and losers of equal size. But what Federer was really saying is that, it's that little edge that just compounds over the course of the match. If the match was just one point long, then Federer would win 54% of his matches. But the fact that it goes on over time means that he's got time to regroup, even though he loses a point. Is that little edge that just keeps multiplying over time and so the longer the match the more matches he'll win, of course, as long as he doesn't get exhausted, so stamina also matters. Boris Becker, by the way, won almost 80% of his matches with only less than a little over 52% winning points because he had a tendency to win the really important ones like tiebreakers. But that's the point is that you don't need to be perfect. You don't even need to be really good. You need to be just slightly better than the average or some benchmark in order to be successful. That applies to almost everything in life as long as you're, slightly better, that edge will just continue to compound and that you'll get better and better and your outcomes.\n\nDo you think that some of the same principles you've applied to systematic investing on a short term basis where you're looking for a higher probability trade with a shorter duration apply on the other side to long term investors like myself.\nVasant Dhar: They do and for the reasons that you pointed out that you need numbers. In fact in 2015, I went to my colleague Aswath Damodaran because I believe that machine learning and quantum methods really applied to short term trading, where you could identify an edge where there were lots of numbers involved. But it was hard to apply to long term investing where withholding periods of many months or even years. Because you just couldn't get enough sample size, you couldn't get enough training data. But I was really intrigued by my colleague Aswath Damodaran who's considered Mr. Valuation on Wall Street and so I went to him in 2015, and we had this conversation about whether it would be possible to create a bot of him. I had a similar conversation with my colleague Scott Galloway at that time should you trust your money to a robot? I'd just written this article. Should you trust your money to a robot? I made the case that you should, when it comes to high frequency trading in short term. But when it came to long term investing, that it was impossible to train a machine like you could with shorter duration stuff.\n\nRemember, Scott, and at the end of that conversation saying, so what you're saying is that trading flows will disappear, but venture capital and private equity is safe. I said, \"Yeah, that's pretty much it\". My conversation with Damodaran was similar, that it would be too hard to actually try and replicate him. What's interesting is, post ChatGPT, we revisited that question. I went back to the Damodaran and I said do you think we could actually build a bat of you now given this new technology? He said, \"Sure, let's give it a shot. You got all my training data\", and so that's what I've been involved in for the last couple of years. We've built this bot that's designed to think like him, and my initial thinking was that we could apply that systematically, as well that we could just apply Damodaran to the S&P 500. It's impossible for him to do it because he can't evaluate 500 companies in a day or even in a week. It's just too much work. But my thinking was, if we can build a machine like him, why can't we just apply it to the entire index and then use it systematically? It's an interesting idea. It may actually work. But I've actually become intrigued with a different type of application of the bot, which is something that allows people to think and reason about companies in a deeper way to run scenarios and say \"What if Trump escalates tariffs, what will valuation of Apple or Nvidia, look like, or what if this tariffs a head fake and we go back to the era of low trade barriers\". This stuff is very laborious for people to do and it's very time consuming. I find it interesting that we can apply AI now systematically to long term investing as well.\n\nAsit Sharma: What was the thing that surprised you most about the Damodaran bot? Basically, you had access to all the training materials, famously public materials. You also had access to Professor Damodaran's very elaborate write ups, his blog post, which they themselves, if you marry up the public spreadsheets that he has for investors, they're an object lesson in how you draw together numbers and narrative what surprised you most in this latest phase, post ChatGPT, where you took more modern tools, let's say, more contemporary tools and recreated the idea maybe the biggest success you had or the biggest pitfall that you didn't expect.\nVasant Dhar: When I started this two years ago with one of my colleagues, Joao Sedoc who's a LLM person, we had no idea whether this would work. It was a wild idea to build a bot like him we tried what most people might try, which is give all his valuations to an LLM, fine tune it, and then have it think about a new case. It just didn't work. It didn't sound like him. There was nothing deep about it. There was nothing profound about it. We just went back to the drawing board and said, just identify all components of his thinking fundamentally, he's got this quantitative model that he calls the Ginsu.\n\nAsit Sharma: This is a spreadsheet.\nVasant Dhar: It's a spreadsheet.\nAsit Sharma: I've used it.\nVasant Dhar: It's incredibly complex. It has all kinds of switches and contexts and all that kind of stuff. But at the end of the day, it's a quantitative model. Inputs gives you a valuation, you do a sensitivity, and there you have it. But the question is how do you marry a story to the numbers. What's the story that is consistent with the numbers? The story involves stepping back from the particular company. I'll give you a great example. When he evaluated Nvidia in 2023, the first question he asked, I called this a framing question was, is AI an instrumental or a disruptive technology. Why would you ask a question like that? You ask a question like that because the markets in those two scenarios tend to be very different. If it's incremental, it's pretty well defined you can put a boundary around it. If it's disruptive, it's much more uncertain. You need to think about what that really means. Disrupting what? Every industry is AI like electricity? Is it like the Internet. It makes you think about the problem in a really broad way. Then his subsequent question when disruptions happen, what's the distribution of winners and losers and he shows that you get a few winners and lots of losers, lots of wannabes. He says, \"I think Nvidia is going to be a winner. They're going to have a dominant position\", and then he goes about thinking about it like what are their margins going to be like? He says, \"What are the margins of people in the semiconductor industry?\" That's a good place to start and the work of Phil Tetlock, by the way, also applies here. He has this work on super forecasters what makes them good and what makes them good is that they anchor themselves in the right part of the problem as opposed to a biased part of the problem. They tend to be relatively unbiased. I realized that Aswath Damodaran was what I call a super forecaster. He just has those properties of what Tetlock calls super forecaster, the ability to really ask the right kinds of questions and insatiable curiosity of anchoring himself.\n\nAsit Sharma: If you had a scale today, where would we be waiting more toward that we will govern AI or AI will govern us, and why?\nVasant Dhar: My fear is that we are slipping into a Huxleyan kind of world, perhaps even without our realization that we are gradually disempowering ourselves in many areas of our life. The machine has become a gatekeeper of human activity in many ways. You apply for a job, you're screened by the AI. You might even be interviewed by the AI increasingly these days. It's not a warm fuzzy feeling, when the machine has become a gatekeeper to human activity. My fear is that we might just slip into this without the machine having evil intentions or being programmed to do harm, that we just slip into this without our explicit realization. That's really my concern.\n\nAsit Sharma: Which stakeholders do you think would be important to ensuring that we don't slip into such a future? Obvious answers would be, governments, perhaps we need regulations, academics, also big tech, but I don't know. What about people who use the machines as well? Who are the stakeholders that should put a voice forward in this decision?\nVasant Dhar: They more than anyone else, everybody. That's why I wrote the book for everyone. I meant for this book to be accessible to everyone because this applies to all of us. I tell my students this as well that it's easy to use this technology as a crutch. It is so tempting to use it as a crutch. But that'll in the long run, will be debilitating. You don't want to go down that road where you got a question and you just throw it to ChatGPT and say, what do you think? Because that's the surest way of going into cognitive decline. I can feel it, by the way, when I use maps. I don't think I navigate as well spatially as I used to. I think I've lost that facility by relying more and more on maps, and I'm aware of that. I now try and navigate myself manually sometimes just to keep that spatial mental muscle alive. That applies to all areas of our lives. Individuals, more than anything else, need to ask themselves how they're consuming this technology. As it is, my colleague Jonathan Haidt says that some of these social media platforms have caused tremendous harm to teenagers. We ain't seen nothing yet in terms of the potential harms that AI could cause if we just let it go unfettered. It's a tough area because as someone said, I was reading a piece by Ezra Klein this morning, where he said who are we to tell people what to consume? Sam Altman said, \"We don't want to be the moral police of the world. We'll open ChatGPT to adult content\". All true, all fair. But that's why it imposes the burden really on the consumer. Among all these people, the burden really is on the consumer to be aware of how you're consuming AI. As I say in my book, you can consume it to become super human. It can really serve to amplify your skills if you use it in the right way. But if you become dependent on it, it'll lead to cognitive decline, and that's no good. That's one of the points I try to make in my book is how to think about that, how to think about being on the right side of what I see as this impending bifurcation of humanity.\n\nAsit Sharma: I think one of the clearest examples of all this is a choice you make that you describe in the book. Some people asked you why don't you use ChatGPT to write the book. You said, \"Right now, machines don't write as well as us for now\". I get that. But I think also underneath that is the desire to express yourself in your own unique style to make the points that you want to make and to have your expression, which is beautiful. By the way, it's a great expression and well written book to be the statement that you put into this work, not to rely on the crutch, just because it would be easy. To input some bullet points and perhaps spit out the product and you go talk about it. It's a world of ideas that you're putting forward. I really appreciated that part of your book, which was \"Hey, there's a reason that I'm writing this myself\".\n\nVasant Dhar: Exactly. By the way, thank you for that compliment. I really appreciate that. But in addition to the fact that I think I write better than ChatGPT and I want to express myself in my own style, it's also so much more fun to do that. At the end of the day, what's life about, if not for having fun? Life is about having fun, and this should be fun, and I had so much fun writing it. There's so much of sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from producing something good by yourself. That's what we should strive for.\nAsit Sharma: Professor Vasant Dhar, this has been an extremely illuminating conversation. Above all things, it's been a lot of fun. I really appreciate your time today, and I hope that you will come back for another conversation at some point in the future.\n\nVasant Dhar: I'd be delighted. Thanks so much for this Asit. I really enjoyed it. Great questions, and I love the conversation.

      "Content": "Quick Read Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) has finally reclaimed its dot-com era highs more than two decades after the internet bubble burst.\nThe stock’s long recovery highlights how hype-driven valuations can bury even essential technology leaders for decades.\nCisco’s survival was driven by steady infrastructure demand and dividends rather than explosive growth.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video Lee and I rewound the clock about 25 years, back to the height of the dot-com boom. At that time, Cisco was one of the hottest stocks on the planet, sitting at the center of the internet infrastructure buildout.\nThe dot-com peak and collapse Lee reminded us just how dominant Cisco was during that period. The company’s stock surged into the $75 to $80 range as investors bet aggressively on internet growth. When the bubble burst in 2000 and 2001, Cisco did not fail as a business, but the stock collapsed and stayed buried for years.\nThat distinction matters. Cisco survived, but survival is not the same thing as delivering returns.\n\nWhy Cisco never disappeared We both agreed that Cisco never truly went away. Its networking equipment remained essential, first for corporate IT and later for data centers and cloud infrastructure. Today, those same products are part of AI-related buildouts, keeping Cisco relevant even if it no longer dominates headlines.\nThe company’s bread-and-butter business gave it durability when many former tech darlings vanished entirely.\n\nA warning for today’s tech investors I emphasized why Cisco’s story matters now. During the dot-com era, expectations for the internet were wildly exaggerated, much like parts of the AI narrative today. Even when a technology changes the world, stocks tied to that theme can remain underwater for decades if investors overpay at the peak.\n\nLee added that investors who bought Cisco at the bottom in 2001 or 2002 did very well. Those who bought near the highs had to wait roughly 25 years just to break even.\nDividends and patience We closed by pointing out that Cisco eventually became a reliable dividend payer, which helped long-term holders endure the long recovery. It was often featured in lists of tech stocks that actually returned cash to shareholders.\nThe lesson is simple but uncomfortable. Any company, no matter how dominant, can get buried by valuation excess and stay there far longer than most investors expect.\n\nStory Continues\nTranscript: [00:00:05] Doug McIntyre: I'm gonna go back, maybe 25 years. And the hot tech stock at that point was Cisco.\n[00:00:13] Lee Jackson: It was one of them. It was on fire because the internet build out was huge.\n[00:00:18] Doug McIntyre: Yep. And they were at the center of the infrastructure play.\n[00:00:22] The internet now, they've disappeared. What happened to them? Where have they gone?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, they didn't disappear. They just went on vacation for about 25 years. And I thought it was interesting recently because Cisco systems still, their products are still needed. They're still, and they're probably selling lots for AI build out and data center build out.\n[00:00:45] I'm sure they're selling a ton, but it took 25 years from the peak of the .com boom. For Cisco, which I think it hit like 75 or 80 bucks, and this is like 2099, 2002, 25 years. And just recent, recently, within the last week or two weeks, it finally got back over that level finally, after 25 years. Now, had you bought it then, at the bottom of barrel in 2001 and 2002, you, would be doing great, but Holders back then, and this is why, this is a lesson for everybody chasing Mag seven and everything else, I mean, Cisco systems survived, because they had a bread and butter sort of product that they could continue to sell.\n\n[00:01:36] But I mean, everything was over exaggerated about the internet, just like it is about AI.

      "Content": "Key Points Tesla deliverables are down year-over-year, and it continues facing headwinds in the U.S. and European markets.\nAs CEO Elon Musk’s feud with President Trump continues, the stock has seen heightened volatility.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAfter soaring in 2023 and 2024, shares of Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) were battered throughout the first half of 2025. The largest U.S. EV-maker slid into Q3 but staged a comeback in the second half of the year and finishing with a roughly 11% gain.\nWhen the company reported Q3 earnings on Oct. 22, 2025, it announced quarterly revenue of $28.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year (YoY). However, earnings of 50 cents per share missed analysts' estimates of 54 cents per share. Concerningly, quarterly net income fell 37% YoY to $1.37 billion.\nAfter several quarters of weakening momentum, Tesla's deliveries are seeing a positive break in trend, according to Canaccord. Further, the firm expects Tesla to announce new electric vehicle models soon, which should help its global sales momentum. The new models will help alleviate any post-Q3 \"cliff\" in the U.S. after EV tax credits go away, Canaccord believes.\n\nOver the past decade, Tesla has suffered incredible losses that have shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the stock's rapid appreciation over the past decade. The company's meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That's certainly a move that's come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it's clear that Musk's visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla's IPO on June 29, 2010.\n24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let's dive into whether Tesla's troubles this year can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher.\n\nKey Drivers of Tesla's Stock Performance 1. Core EV Business: Tesla's most important business line is unsurprisingly the company's auto business. With sales of the company's EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company's future prospects in proportion to how the company's core revenue and earnings driver is performing.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla's value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company's core electric vehicle offering, Tesla's energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen.\n\n3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that's been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump's election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We'll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come.\nWhat Wall Street Thinks Tesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. Analyst price targets span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $19.05 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $600 per share. Thus, there's not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn't as easy as it seems.\n\nIt's worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though. However, given how Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it'll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it's best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one's own DCF analysis on and coming to one's own price target.\nHowever, institutional ownership of Tesla remains light. As of Dec. 8, 2025, just 47.64% of the company's float is held by institutional owners, with 117 of them having entirely liquidated their positions over the past year.\n\nTesla's 2026 Outlook As was the case last year, analysts' opinions on where Tesla could be headed in 2026 vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries, which were forecast at 1.95 million units by Barclays and 2.08 million by Bloomberg, disappointed last year. Tesla reported 418,227 deliveries in Q4 2025 and 1,636,129 for 2025. Year over year, those figures are down 16% and 9%, respectively. Tesla was affected by the expiration of the U.S. electric vehicle tax credit in 2025 as well as increased competition in Europe. Morningstar forecasts that deliveries will continue to decrease through the first three quarters of 2026.\n\nMusk remains optimistic, expecting a 20% to 30% delivery increase in the year to come. Additionally, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer, but the company recently saw its share of the EV market slip below 50% in California.\nTesla Stock 2026 Price Target Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $395.89, or 12.34% potential downside from today's price. Of the 31 analysts covering Tesla, the stock currently receives a consensus “Hold” rating, with 13 analysts rating it a \"Buy,\" 10 rating it a \"Hold\" and eight rating it a \"Sell.\"\n\n2 4/7 Wall St. 's year-end price target for Tesla is more bullish at $461.73, which represents potential upside of just 2.22% from the current share price.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

I'm Jared Blicky, your host, and with me is my co-host, Yahoo Finance senior reporter, Brooke De Palma, who's here to connect the dots and to be that bridge between.Wall Street and Main Street. Today we're gonna be talking about the AI trade heading into 2026. Doesn't get any more fundamental to the fourth year of this bull market than that. Our word of the day is moat, not just for medieval castles. They protect businesses from competition. Key question, does OpenAI still have one?And on today's market show and tell, we are translating the AI spending boom into one question. Is anyone getting paid back this year? Plus, this episode is brought to you by the number 448, as in terawatt hours. That is the astronomical amount of electricity that data centers used globally in 2025. Why the electric bill is a new speed limit for AI.And today we are welcoming Ivana Deleska, who spent most of her career at top hedge funds including Citadel, Millennium, and the Tiger Ecosystem. She's brought that institutional style playbook into the ETF world, launching Spear Alpha, Ter SPRX with the idea that everyday investors deserve the same quality toolkit. We are excited to talk with you today, Ivana. So just give us your big picture overview of how you see the AI trade shaping up as we head into theWell,\n1:33 spk_1\nthanks for having me, guys. So basically, as we get into 2026, we see still a lot of opportunities in AI. Unlike the prior two years where we really saw all the stocks trade together as one, we are starting to see really significant bifurcation between different teams and different complexes, depending on who is aligned with which company. So we believe this is gonna continue for the next 3 to 5 years, and it's really gonna be about who is well position.At any given time to capture the upside. And\n2:02 spk_2\nwe'll definitely get to more of who is well positioned, but time now for our word of the day, and it's one that gets thrown around all the time in tech. It's moat, which is a lasting advantage that keeps consumers from switching to another product or service. Now, in the old days, a moat meant something you could easily identify a brand that people trust, a factory network that no one can copy, or a product that's so hard to switch off, you don't even try. But in AI.A lot of people here moat and think it's all about the best model winning, and that's where things can get a bit tricky here, because if models get cheaper and more commoditized, commoditized, the advantage can shift to who owns distribution, who owns the workflow essentially, who's embedded in the tools that people use all day, and who can prove real returns on all this spending that we're seeing. So Ivana, when you look at the AI landscape, what does a real moat look like today?\n2:54 spk_1\nWell, interesting, even if you look at the history in terms of what companies have modes, modes have been built over time. So, right, like you don't build a moat overnight, and we believe we're just starting to see companies starting to build modes, but there's really nobody that is untouchable at this point in time because we're so early in the adoption cycle. So, Google coming into this is coming from a very strong position becauseThey have such a large installed base and they've been able to build on top of it. Nvidia has 80% market share, right in GPU, so you would argue they have a strong mode, uh, coming in here, but still, the, the, the, the proof is still in the pudding. There's still a lot more to go from here, so there is room for competitors, uh, to come in. There is room for companies to establish themselves on the model side. That's another competitive area where it's.A little hard to tell who is gonna win, so I think modes are important in technology, but sometimes people overplay it because it's a pretty competitive space. You're always under attack. Yes,\n3:53 spk_2\ngo ahead. We did see 2025, the returns that Google ended up having at year end actually surpassed that of Nvidia, and some would argue that maybe it's even getting ahead of OpenAI. Do you think it's because Google has this book backingit?\n4:07 spk_1\nAbsolutely. So they have a mode that they've built over time. So the moment they roll out a tool or an AI application, exactly, they're rolling it out to a much wider audience than somebody starting from scratch, having to build these customers uh and go after them, which is very costly.\n4:23 spk_0\nI mentioned OpenAI in the beginning because it seemed like they were a leader back going back to 22, 2023, and they had this semi-exclusive partnership with Microsoft, and now Microsoft is entertaining other options, other models. I'm just wondering, and OpenAI was our company of the year for 2025 because it was the big deal in AI.Uh, but going forward, do you think they have any kind of mode? Can they build one, or is it just, are they commodity, uh, you know, like manufacturer here?\n4:53 spk_1\nThey're certainly positioned well to build the moat, but they don't have a moat today. And this is why Microsoft is diversifying their bets across the board and able to offer other models and products because we're so early that it's very hard to tell who is gonna win and whether there is gonna be one company that captures.I think the interesting thing for OpenAI has been that they've been able to attract a lot of enterprises, and that's gonna be a very big opportunity for them. So that's really what we're closely watching, whether they're gonna be able to make some traction with enterprises that can come with a lot more immediate ROI than the consumer side. So that's something to, to put on, on, on people's radar. And\n5:32 spk_2\nwhat happens, OpenAI rumored to go public this year, how would that help them in building that mode?\n5:38 spk_1\nWell, as you guys know, AI requires a lot of capital, so being able to access the public markets could offer them access to capital and that would allow them to build a moat. Like, if you look at the companies that are in the private markets, they really need to constantly come to uh to their.Investors and ask for capital and you really need to be offering these products for free like OpenAI is doing, which costs billions of dollars in order for people to trial them and be able to see if they work or not. So it's all about capital from where we stand today if you want to win in AI.\n6:12 spk_0\nAnd before we get to our market show and tell, I wanna ask you about Agentic AI. Uh, we didn't really, we saw the beginnings of agents kind of roll out, and OpenAI has one. I got to use it a little bit, but it's a long way off from, I think, what we expect it to do, and part of that has to do with cost. I know you've been writing about this on LinkedIn, about five things to watch out for in 2026. So talk, talk to us about the, uh, prospects for finally getting these agents in, in this\n6:38 spk_1\nyear. So yeah, you're, you're spot on. AI agents.We're expecting them to be a much bigger deal uh last year, and what ended up happening is because Nvidia had a delay in their hardware deployment at scale, the cost didn't decline quite as fast as people expected, so we're really waiting for this new Blackwell systems and the Blackwell Ultra to get deployed for you to be able to see much lower cost of using AI. Basically for the agents to be successful, they need to be offered for free, right? So.Whether it's social media agent or whether it's a productivity agent, you're not gonna try it if you need to pay 30,000 4 $5000 as a consumer. So that's where really the costs come in play, and they really need to drop about 10 times from here for people to be able to start using this on a day to day basis.\n7:30 spk_0\nFortunately, 10x is nothing in the world of AI. That could, that could take months. Alright, I kid a little bit, but almost not. Time now for market show and tell, and today we are translating.One of the most important four-letter questions in the market, ROIC or return on invested capital. ROIC simply tells you whether a company is turning its investments into real profit. It's the, are we getting paid back number? And to be a little bit more specific, ROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it invests, like debt and equity into profit. Higher ROIC means the business is getting paid more per pay or more payoff per dollar invested.So the big question isn't just who's spending the most, it's who's spending in a way that raises their ROIC over time. Who's building something that compounds? So how are you looking atthis?\n8:20 spk_1\nWell, we're spot on focused on that, and basically what we're finding right now that the is that the biggest ROIC is across the value chain, right? So when you're investing in some of these hardware component suppliers, they really don't need to invest a significant amount of dollars, neither in.Apex nor R&D. A lot of their products are already built and they're just tweaking them to adapt to, uh, be able to use the main AI. So we're seeing very significant returns in that space. Now if you look at companies like on the model side, they do need to spend significant capital where we're not really seeing ROIC today. We may see it in 3 to 5 years, but that's really gonna be the big question mark. So that's the, the, the big kind of spectrum. Hardware, you're seeing it.Immediately and then the model companies would be like 3 to 5 years out.\n9:10 spk_2\nFor investorslistening right now, what are some of those names that you're watching who are on both sides of thatspectrum?\n9:15 spk_1\nSo on the networking side, we like companies like Astero Labs, Arista Networks, uh, Coherent, Lumentum, those are on the optics side. They're basically helping connect these chips, whether it's two different data centers or within the chips together. I think this is where a lot of the performance.Improvement is gonna come on the chips because the chips themselves are quite optimized right now. So as we look forward to see where the improvement is coming, a lot is gonna come from the networking. Power generation is another significant area that we're closely watching. I think whoever has access to power is gonna be able to benefit. So whether it's on the utility, the IPP side, companies like Constellation Energy, or on uh the data center builders, companies like Terrawolf and um.And applied digital, those are some of the names that we really like here.\n10:07 spk_0\nI wanted to ask you a minute ago, what is all this portend for an OpenAI, uh, IPO this year if their ROIC means that they have spent so much money, it's gonna take them a while to be able to recoup a lot of that cost.\n10:19 spk_1\nWell, I think that's why they've been holding off on the IPO and trying to see how many sponsors they can find on the private market. So the Nvidias of the world, whether they can partner with them, SoftBank Oracle.How can they kind of build up to a point where they show some return to come to the, uh, before they come to the public market. The public market generally prefers companies that can show results and deliver on a consistent basis. So it's gonna be tricky to see how, how they do. I think timing when to come to market is very important. So if I was in open AI shoes, I would probably wait a little longer.Before coming to\n10:55 spk_0\nare they going to be like a big bellwether for the market? Like if OpenAI doesn't get that next funding round, or if the IPO and they miss on one of their numbers, is that gonna just, uh, tank the entire AI trade? Well,\n11:07 spk_1\ninterestingly, I think that may have been the case 1 to 2 years ago. I don't think that it's the case anymore because I think the trade has broadened out to a few different complexes. So now you have Google come up, um.You have Anthropy come up with with their models, so they're multiple model companies. I think that's one of the things that we like about AI here is that the trade has really broadened out. So right now, you see a lot of the companies that are tied to open AI like Oracle, they're not performing as well just because of the factors that you discussed, but you see other companies that are not tied to that complex and are maybe more uh tied to Google or, or some of.The other players or or or AWS that are seeing some benefits, uh, over the past six months, and I think those are gonna probably do well this year as well.\n11:52 spk_2\nYeah, Oraclesocket quite the ride in 2025. Definitely look at that chart on Yahoo Finance's website. We do need to take a quick short break, but coming up we're talking all about electricity that AI is guzzling and a runaway showdown that pits spacesuits versus hard hats. Stay tuned for all that.This episode is brought to you by the number 448. That's how many not kilowatts, not megawatts or gigawatts were used last year, but just how many terawatt hours, one of the largest units of electricity that data centers use worldwide in 2025, according to Gartner. And here's why that matters for the AI trade. Every new model, every new agent, every new tool that promises.to save you time, well, it eventually has to run somewhere on real machines, on a real grid with real power constraints, and it's really just a reminder that AI is also, well, an infrastructure story. And sometimes the speed limit isn't the chip, it's actually the electricity. Ivana, just walk us through how big of a constraint is power and energy moving into the AI trade in 2026.\n13:05 spk_1\nSo, this power is gonna really be the key, not just in 26, but over the next five years. And the reason is because it takes a really long time to add power generation, and it goes back into the whole value chain, because even if you have the permits, even if you have the land, then do you really have the equipment. So, we're really seeing that becoming a real bottleneck over the next uh,Next 3 to 5 years. It's not a bottleneck today, it's not necessarily a bottleneck for the next generation of chips, but as we build more and more infrastructure, we're really kind of being at the limits of what power can do, and this is why you're seeing the space theme emerge, right? People are looking for where other sources of power that we can go to and, and we can find because I think as uh as opposed to.Uh, building physical, um, power plants on Earth, the regulation is much more loose in space, right? So you don't have to go through multiple regulatory bodies to have something approved. So I think this is going to be something we're closely watching is where is that actually the next power, uh, unit gonna come from.\n14:10 spk_0\nI, I have a real basic question here. Where does the power come from in space? Now I, I imagine like some huge solar array just capturing.You know, solar energy and spread out maybe like, but you'd need a big surface area to do that. So are we able to do this at scale yet? And what companies are doing this?\n14:27 spk_1\nWell, I think there are a lot of companies doing, uh, doing solar in space because that's how they're operating the satellites today. So really it's gonna be a question of how can we scale this, right? So, uh, it's really the, the power, um, intensity in space in space is significant.Significantly higher, so that's why you don't need as big of a system as you would imagine that you would need, um, exactly, uh, you would need on, on Earth. So I think that's really where, on one hand, this sounds like sci-fi, but if you look at how the satellites that are built today are functioning, it's actually not very different from what companies are, are proposing. So, uh, that's something that we're, we're closely, closely watching.\n15:08 spk_2\nMany companies are building out these data centers. Now you're saying we're also seeing space companies build out data data centers in outer space, quite literally. Are you nervous that there might be an overbuild happening here?\n15:20 spk_1\nWell, interestingly run\n15:21 spk_0\nout of room. I can guarantee.\n15:24 spk_1\nInterestingly, with all the constraints that we have, we don't necessarily see an overbuild because even if you look at the space theme, for you to have an actual.Large scale data center in space functioning, we're looking at 5 to 10 years out, right? So, but even for that from an investment perspective, you're going to need to start launching significant amount of satellites to build that up, to build that up. So I think launch launch costs today need to significantly go lower and the actual chip needs to look very different than what it's looking today.But that still doesn't mean that you need to wait 5 years to make money in the space, because the moment the market tightens, and there is incremental demand for launch like new launches, you're gonna be able to, to realize some um gains in some of the stocks that provide the the launches.\n16:15 spk_0\nYou mentioned Constellation as a name, an energy provider did well in 2025, and, you know, the utility trade did pretty well because it became an AI offshoot. What are the prospects for the AI trade in terms ofUtilities in 2026, is that another example of a bifurcated market where you have some winners and, you know, some haves and some have-nots. How are you picking these?\n16:36 spk_1\nSo, interestingly, in the utility space, you really need to go project by project and analyze which companies have still capacity that they can build on top of. So a lot of it, for example, Constellation, operates the largest nuclear fleet in the US, so they have several plants where they can add incremental capacity on the existing site, which, as you would imagine, would be much.Easier to do than going to a completely new one where the uh the surrounding community may not be familiar with nuclear, so that's really the biggest bottleneck for nuclear in the US and that's why we like uh we like Constellation. We really also like the Bitcoin miners that have been uh securing energy capacity for the purposes of Bitcoin mining, but now they're realizing, hey, we can actually use this for uh for data centers, exactly, and their business model is changing.Dramatically, right, because you're going from being exposed to a commodity that nobody can really predict to a business model where they're locking in the supply cost, they're locking in the contract, so it's really becoming a very stable, almost like a RI business model. So, I think if they can execute on this well and build on top of what they already have, they could.Be significant upside both on earnings but also on the multiple sides.\n17:52 spk_2\nWhatare specific names within that that are bitcoin miners turned these AI plays?\n17:58 spk_1\nSo some of them are applied digital, Terrawolf, those are the ones we own. Cypher Mining, Irene are the ones that you are also in that in that space. The key is to findManagement team that is able to execute with limited risk. So that's what we're looking for companies that already have a pipeline. They're not necessarily building ahead without um without contracts. They have like good visibility into securing contracts. So that's kind of how we are assessing the space that it's not just being able to um.Uh, have the, the, the headline that you're, you're in, in the, the business, but actually having the actual, uh, fundamental, um, backup.\n18:40 spk_0\nExcellent. Well, it's time to go back to space because now we've got a market's take on a classic Hollywood gab show staple, who wore it better. And today's runway is all about the next big thing in data centers. On the left catwalk, strutt's orbital.Compute, part astronaut, part Silicon Valley. It's a shiny spacesuit with a mirror visor, satellite panels, shoulder pads, and a little mini server rack on its back. His vibe is, why fight for land and power on Earth when you can build above it all. And on the right catwalk, it's power plant proximity, utility cop with a hard hat, steel-toed boots, and a tool belt full of high voltage icons.The look says, don't chase the cloud, chase the electricity, put the data center right next to the plug. Ivana, which looks gets us there first? Are we talking about the spacesuit or the hard hat?\n19:30 spk_1\nWell, in the near term, it's definitely going to be the hard hat, right? We're still very far away from the spacesuit, but I think there's going to be some really significant returns to be made on the space side. So that's how I would frame it. I think there's a.Still a lot to do on planet Earth, but there's a lot of opportunities in space as well.\n19:47 spk_2\nWe'vebeen talking about outer space so much during this conversation, and this builds on many conversations that I had really towards the later part of 2025. This excitement about the space trade for people who are listening right now, for investors, when they think about the space trade, what are some names that you're seeing in the space right now that maybe now is the time to get in as this sort of ramps up?\n20:06 spk_1\nSo we really like Rocket Lab on the, on the, in the space trade because they're basically positioned very well on the launch side, and for you to do anything in space, you need to be able to launch things, right? So, that's really where we where we see the bottleneck uh create. So SpaceX is another one that, that is gonna be coming out, uh, hopefully this year. I think that's gonna be a very exciting opportunity for investors. So, as a tracking stock on that, we.Really like uh Ecostar, so they basically sold Spectrum to SpaceX in exchange for getting shares. So it's a bit of a proxy of how SpaceX will trade and how their ownership will, which will track. So those are some of the names we, uh, we really like. There is also AST Space Mobile, that's another, uh, company we like. They're building, um, a, a, a constellation of satellites that are able to provide.Broadband, but as we get into uh further in the data center trade, they're partnered with Google, so we think that they could be one that could benefit from Google trying to do something in space. So there's just a lot going on and uh very early innings, but uh it's going to be interesting to watch. Yeah,\n21:13 spk_0\nthatleads me to my next question, because when youever you have so much hype, a company just has to put space in their name and you know it's going to go to the moon temporarily, butYou want to look for lasting value here, somebody who's gonna be in this game for a while, so what do we, what should investors steer clear of, like, you see this, that's kind of a warning sign in the space trade. So\n21:32 spk_1\nwhat we really like about the space trade where it is today is that we've already gone through 345 years of these companies going through negative cash flows and, and, uh, and negative returns as they've been kind of developing products and putting R&D to work. We're at a point now whereThe Broadband side is showing some promise in terms of commercial adoption, so they should be becoming profitable on that front uh within the next 1 to 2 years. So we like the companies that are going to be profitable in the next 1 to 2 years. That's a pretty big focus for us. And then also the defense part of the stocks. So a lot of them will have a defense component to them, and that is tied to military contracts which are providing a nice baseline, uh, baseline for the stocks. So.What we're looking for here is companies that have like a solid base of whether it's military contracts or commercial broadband, so that will provide kind of downside protection, and then you can use the data center as an upside for the next 3 to 5 years.\n22:34 spk_0\nIvana, you know your stuff. I am impressed here and uh no joke, it's, it's, uh, your resume speaks for itself, and uh we're happy that you were able to join us today. Quick review, I mean, we began with the word of the day, which was moat.And I think we're all just learning that the moats have yet to be established for the most part. A lot of these companies have to figure out their competitive advantage. We, we spend so much money. I say we like I've done it, but we've poured so much money into AI. 2026 is gonna be the year when you see a lot of monetization, uh, kind of, uh, a separation from the pack and a bifurcation, if you like that word there. And it's not just about getting ahead of the pack, it is, uh, securing the power to do all of this. So we talked about.The AI power trade and all the utilities and the importance of them. And then Ivana gave us a number of critical criteria to judge some of these new businesses as they are literally launching off into space.

      "Title": "Nvidia’s $4 Trillion Stock Rally Faces More Threats Than Ever",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-4-trillion-stock-rally-104747765.html",
      "Content": "GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\n(Bloomberg) — The world’s most valuable company is on shaky stock market footing as 2026 gets underway.\nNvidia Corp. ( NVDA ) shares are down 9.1% since hitting a record on Oct. 29, well underperforming the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) Index, as investors grow concerned about the sustainability of artificial intelligence spending and the chip giant’s grip on the market.\n\nThe recent drop is notable considering that on the day the stock last closed at an all-time high, it was up more than 1,300% since the end of 2022 and Nvidia’s market capitalization was over $5 trillion compared with roughly $400 billion less than three years earlier. Now, the stock has lost $460 billion of market value in a matter of months, taking its three-year gain to nearly 1,200%.\nMeanwhile, the dominant AI chipmaker is facing more competition than ever before from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD ), as well as its biggest clients, including Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN ). And Wall Street is growing increasingly worried about Nvidia’s investments in many of its customers, which could be seen as artificially propping up demand.\n\n“The risks have clearly risen,” said JoAnne Feeney, partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, which has $13 billion in assets.\nThe impact of a Nvidia downturn would be felt by most equity investors. Since the market’s bull run began in October 2022, the stock accounts for roughly 16% of the S&P 500’s advance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The next biggest contributor, Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), is responsible for around 7%.\nThat said, demand for Nvidia shares remains strong with the company trading at a cheaper valuation than many of its Big Tech peers despite scorching earnings expectations. The Santa Clara, California-based company is projected to generate 57% profit growth on a 53% increase in sales in its next fiscal year, which ends in January 2027. Apple, by contrast, is expected to see gains around 10% in both measurements.\n\nWall Street also is hardly backing away from Nvidia, with 76 of the 82 analysts who cover the company holding buy ratings and only one recommending selling. The average Wall Street price target implies a gain of 37% over the next 12 months, which would push its market value over $6 trillion.\n“Nvidia is still likely to be one of the fastest growing companies in public markets,” Feeney said. “Do you want to own that? Yes.”\nNvidia’s next generation chips, dubbed Rubin, are nearing release this year and customers will soon be able to try out the technology, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said Monday in a presentation at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nStory continues\n“Demand for Nvidia GPUs is skyrocketing,” Huang said. “It’s skyrocketing because models are increasing by a factor of ten, an order of magnitude every single year.”\nHere’s a look at a few key issues facing the stock in 2026.\nChip Competition Nvidia is the premier producer of AI accelerators, commanding more than 90% of the market. But competitors are starting to gain steam.\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. has won big data center orders from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and Oracle Corp. ( ORCL ), and its data center revenue is projected to jump about 60% to almost $26 billion in 2026, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms Inc. ( META ) and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ), which account for more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, are building their own chips in an attempt to get around the expense of buying Nvidia’s, which can cost more than $30,000 apiece.\n\n“People will use less costly chips if they can,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. “It’s becoming clear that maintaining 90% market share is going to be a challenge.”\nAlphabet’s Google began working on its first tensor processing unit more than a decade ago and has adapted it to train and run queries for its AI models. Google’s latest version of the Gemini AI chatbot, which received glowing reviews, is optimized to run on the chips. In October, Alphabet reported a chip deal with Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) valued in the tens of billions of dollars. In November, The Information reported that Meta is in talks to rent chips from Google Cloud in 2026 and use them in data centers in 2027.\nDemand for these custom-made chips is lifting Broadcom Inc. ( AVGO ), which builds semiconductors for the AI giants. Growth in Broadcom’s application-specific integrated circuit business, known as ASIC, has vaulted it into the ranks of the world’s most valuable companies. At $1.6 trillion, Broadcom is now bigger than Tesla Inc. ( TSLA )\n\nNvidia’s move to license technology and hire executives from startup chipmaker Groq on Dec. 24 seemed to be an acknowledgment of growing demand for more specialized and less costly chips. The company plans to include elements of Groq’s chips in its future designs, giving it access to so-called low latency semiconductors, an alternative approach used in running AI software that’s similar to ASICs.\n\nThat said, the demand for AI computing power is so vast that Big Tech companies are still hoovering up Nvidia’s chips even as they deploy their own. As a result, Nvidia’s market share is expected to remain intact for the foreseeable future, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kunjan Sobhani and Oscar Hernandez Tejada.\n“The market is underestimating Nvidia’s position,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Joseph Moore, who has a buy rating on the stock, wrote in a research note last month. “We continue to think that Nvidia will be the highest ROI solution in cloud.”\nCapital expenditures by Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta are projected to be more than $400 billion in 2026, with much of it going toward data-center equipment. That’s in addition to hundreds of billions of dollars to lease data-center space developed by others in the coming years. OpenAI has pledged to spend $1.4 trillion in the coming years, even though there are doubts about the money-losing startup’s ability to cover those costs.\n\nMargins and Valuation With rivals offering cheaper alternatives, investors are keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s profit margins because any weakness in the company’s pricing model will show up there.\nThe chipmaker’s gross margin, a key measure of profitability that excludes the cost of goods sold, was in the mid-70s in percentage terms in fiscal 2024 and 2025. But it dipped in fiscal 2026 due to higher costs from the ramp-up of its Blackwell series chips. The figure is projected to be 71.2% in fiscal 2026, which ends on Jan. 31, and Nvidia says it will climb back to around 75% in fiscal 2027. So a margin shortfall would likely set off alarms on Wall Street.\nAnother factor that’s keeping investors in Nvidia’s camp is the stock’s relatively cheap valuation. At 25 times profit expected over the next 12 months, Nvidia trades at a discount to all of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks save for Meta. It’s less expensive than more than a quarter of the stocks in the S&P 500, including TurboTax software maker Intuit Inc.\n\nNvidia “is being valued as if the cycle has ended, as if nobody will deploy AI, as if there’s going to be a lot of stumbling blocks,” said Vivek Arya, a semiconductor analyst at Bank of America. “That is the opportunity from an investor perspective and it’s of course very different from what we saw at the peak of the internet cycle.”\nTop Tech Stories\nNvidia Corp. said it has seen strong demand from customers in China for the H200 chip.\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. announced a new chip for corporate data center use and talked up the attributes of a future generation of products for that market.\nIntel Corp. showed off laptop computers based on processors with a new design, part of the chipmaker’s effort to make its products competitive again.\nAmazon.com Inc. unveiled a television designed to resemble a piece of framed art, making it the latest TV maker to emulate a sleek design popularized by Samsung Electronics Co.\nDell Technologies Inc. is bringing back its well-regarded XPS laptop brand after discontinuing it last year, as a top executive said the PC business had “gotten a bit off course.”\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nNo major earnings expected\n—With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nZillow’s CEO Is Ready for Another Slow Year in the US Housing Market\nDutch Bros Is Out-Starbucksing Rivals With the Sugariest Drinks\nOzempic Users Actually Spend More Dining Out.

      "Content": "A US federal court has refused Amazon’s motion to dismiss a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing the retailer of charging excessive prices for essential goods during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nUS District Judge Robert Lasnik ruled that claims brought under Washington consumer protection laws were sufficiently clear when applied to pricing practices and could encompass the alleged conduct.\n\nSeattle-based Hagens Berman managing partner Steve Berman said: “This is a significant victory for consumers who allege that Amazon made billions in excess profits during the pandemic.”\nIn his decision, Lasnik said it was reasonable to infer that Amazon took advantage of pandemic conditions when public health restrictions and supply disruptions limited consumer choice and imposed unfair prices on certain goods.\nThe complaint alleges that prices on a range of products sold through Amazon’s platform surged, including a 1,044% increase for toilet paper.\nIt also cites hikes of 1,523% for cold remedies and up to 1,800% for some face masks.\nLasnik noted that internal Amazon documents suggested the company was aware of what constituted price gouging and had told state attorneys general that it was seeking to curb such behaviour.\n\nIn an order dated 5 January, he wrote that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged that “Amazon exploited vulnerable consumers who turned to Amazon as a lifeline for consumer goods and food items during a public health crisis, accumulating huge and unjust profits”.\nThe court also issued separate rulings blocking several subpoenas served by Amazon, finding that they appeared intended to harass or embarrass the class representatives.\nLasnik said that “the reasonable inference is that Amazon is trying to make this litigation as difficult, burdensome, and potentially embarrassing as possible for the named plaintiffs’ closest associates”.\nThe lawsuit was first filed on 21 April 2020 and seeks compensation for consumers who paid what are described as “unfair” prices for food and other consumer goods purchased on Amazon between 31 January 2020 and 20 October 2022, around the period when Washington and other states lifted Covid-related states of emergency.\n\nThe proposed class includes individuals who bought consumer or food items categorised as emergency goods during the period and whose prices were allegedly set at unfair levels.\nThe court said the exact determination of which prices were unfair would be addressed after the completion of discovery and expert assessment.\nRetail Insight Network has contacted Amazon for a comment.\n\"US judge allows Amazon Covid-era price gouging lawsuit to proceed\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

      "Content": "BYDDF\n\nKey Points Tesla just reported its electric vehicle sales for the fourth quarter of 2025, and they capped off the sharpest annual decline in the company's history.\nTesla is losing market share to more affordable brands, like BYD, in important markets like Europe, and it won't be easy to recover.\nInvestors are paying a premium for Tesla stock based on its exciting product pipeline, but its sky-high valuation could open the door to steep losses this year.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is trading at a sky-high valuation, as investors place early bets on the future success of product platforms like the Cybercab autonomous robotaxi and the Optimus humanoid robot. These could eventually become the most valuable opportunities in the company's history, but there's a glaring issue in the here and now that investors shouldn't ignore.\nTesla is one of the world's largest manufacturers of electric vehicles (EVs), and this business still represents 75% of its total revenue. Unfortunately, sales plummeted by the largest amount in the company's history during 2025, as rising competition eroded its market share.\nThe Cybercab and Optimus are still a few years away from mass commercialization, which means Tesla's financial results will face significant pressure in the short-term if its EV business continues to sputter. Here's why investors might want to avoid this stock for 2026.\nThe largest annual sales decline in company history Tesla was the undisputed leader of the EV industry in 2023, delivering a record 1.79 million cars to customers worldwide for the year. But the competitive landscape shifted rapidly, and the company's EV deliveries sank by 1% in 2024, marking the first annual sales decline since the launch of its flagship Model S in 2011.\n\nThe situation worsened in 2025. Last week, Tesla revealed it delivered just 418,227 EVs in the fourth quarter (ended Dec. 31), falling short of Wall Street's consensus forecast of 422,850. It took Tesla's total deliveries to 1.63 million for the year, representing an 8.5% drop compared to 2024. It was the largest annual sales decline in the company's history.\nConsumers in some of Tesla's biggest markets, like Europe and China, are choosing lower-cost options as cost-of-living pressures continue to bite. China-based BYD , for example, sells its entry-level Dolphin Surf EV for just $26,900 in Europe -- much cheaper than Tesla's Model 3, which starts at over $40,000 in most countries across the region. The inability to compete saw Tesla's market share shrink from 2.4% to 1.7% in Europe during 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Tesla's sales figures declined overall last year, BYD boasted a whopping 28% increase worldwide.\nThe Cybercab and Optimus are a while away The income from Tesla's EV business fuels the development of its robotaxi and humanoid robot programs, so its current situation could have wide-reaching consequences for the company's future. According to recent guidance from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the Cybercab won't enter mass production until the end of 2026, and Optimus is even further away from commercialization.\n\nWith that said, these products present Tesla with a massive financial opportunity. The Cybercab will run on the company's full self-driving (FSD) software, enabling it to autonomously haul passengers and make small commercial deliveries around the clock. This will create a new revenue stream, which Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management predicts could be worth $756 billion per year from 2029.\nBut there is a caveat. Tesla's FSD software isn't approved for unsupervised use anywhere in the U.S. yet, and if this hurdle isn't cleared in the coming months, the Cybercab could be grounded before it even rolls off the production line.\nTurning to Optimus, Musk believes humanoid robots will outnumber humans by 2040 because of their versatility. They can be tasked with mundane or even dangerous jobs in offices, factories, and households alike. Musk says Optimus could become Tesla's most successful product ever, with $10 trillion in potential revenue on the table over the long term.\n\nThe latest Optimus 3 robot is unlikely to enter mass production until the end of this year at the earliest, but Musk thinks it will scale to 1 million annual units very quickly.\nTesla's valuation opens the door to significant downside Tesla has generated earnings of $1.44 per share over the last four reported quarters (ended Sept. 30), placing its stock at a sky-high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 292. When we compare Tesla to other tech powerhouses worth $1 trillion or more, its valuation is in a universe of its own. The P/E ratio of the next-most-expensive stock, Broadcom , is a whopping 75% lower:\nTesla is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter operating results on Jan. 28, and in light of the company's weak EV sales for the three-month period, its profits are likely to have suffered a sharp decline. That will probably drag down its trailing-12-month earnings per share, which will make its stock look even more expensive on a P/E basis.\n\nThe Cybercab and Optimus are still a long way away from generating meaningful revenue, so they won't be able to fill the void in Tesla's financial results from its declining EV sales. In my opinion, that creates a significant downside risk for Tesla stock this year.\nWe just issued 'double down' alerts on 3 stocks — find out if Tesla made our list Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "XOM\n\nTSLA\n\nQuick Read Average U.S. gasoline prices have fallen to roughly $2.75 per gallon, marking five consecutive weeks of declines.\nLower fuel costs directly improve household affordability and support consumer-driven GDP growth.\nCheap gasoline weakens the economic case for electric vehicles, especially outside high-tax states like California.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video Lee and I discussed a data point that has major economic implications. The national average price for regular gasoline has dropped to about $2.75 per gallon, a level not seen in a long time. Lee and I both agreed this is not a minor headline, but a meaningful shift for households and the broader economy.\n\nWhy gasoline matters more than most commodities I pointed out that while markets obsess over gold, silver, or even stock prices, gasoline directly affects daily life. For the average American family, fuel costs can approach $3,000 a year. When that number falls, discretionary income rises almost immediately. Lee agreed that this shows up clearly in recent CPI data, where energy prices have been one of the few components falling sharply.\n\nAffordability and GDP impact We emphasized that consumer spending drives roughly 80% of U.S. GDP. Lower gasoline prices act like a tax cut, freeing up cash for other spending. Whether it is commuting, taking kids to activities, or heating homes in colder states, fuel costs touch nearly every household budget.\nRegional differences matter Lee highlighted how geography plays a major role. In much of the South, gasoline prices are already near or even below $2 per gallon, largely due to proximity to refineries and lower taxes. In contrast, prices remain well above $4 in California because of heavy state taxation. That gap has real behavioral consequences for consumers.\n\nImplications for electric vehicles I raised the point that falling gas prices make EVs a tougher sell. When gasoline was near $5 in 2022, the economic argument for EV adoption was compelling. At $2.75 and falling, that math changes dramatically. Lee agreed that this helps explain why EV sales remain strongest in high-price regions like California, while adoption struggles elsewhere.\n\nOil producers and the bigger picture We closed by discussing how major integrated producers like Exxon Mobil can remain profitable even at much lower oil prices due to refining and chemical operations. Lower prices may also boost consumption, while OPEC+ appears cautious about increasing supply too aggressively. For now, consumers are the clear winners, even if the long-term energy transition faces new headwinds.\n\nStory Continues\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, yesterday, the price of a gallon of regular gas in the United States on average dropped to 2.75.\n[00:00:13] It hasn't seen 2.75 in a long, long time. Gas buddy said that's the fifth week in a row and gas buddy said it's not over. It's gonna continue to drop. crude, west Texas was at about 80 in January. The last time I looked it was at 57. Now you can say gas is driven to some extent by refineries, some extent by state taxes, but gasoline is oil driven.\n\n[00:00:44] Don't. Absolutely, it is. Don't try to convince me of anything else. No, absolutely. It does. A, it does a few things and I want you to add to this list. The first one is that Americans now talk about affordability, If you look at the CPI over the last six to nine months, what's the only major component that's dropping fast\n[00:01:08] Lee Jackson: Energy prices, fuel and\n[00:01:10] Doug McIntyre: gasoline.\n[00:01:11] Lee Jackson: Gasoline.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: and then if you say to yourself, gasoline is about $3,000 for an average family, the annual cost of gasoline, all right. If affordability is a problem and it's affecting your discretionary income, which affects GDP in the United States.\n[00:01:30] Lee Jackson: Yeah, it does, 'cause it's 80%.\n\n[00:01:32] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. It's not bad news at all that people are watching that part of their household budget drop at all.\n[00:01:40] It's huge. It's absolutely huge. So to, to me, it's much better for the economy than most commodity price moves. It's nice to say gold is up and down. Gold and silver do not affect people's monthly spending. No gasoline prices in many homes, it's a major component of their life day in and out.\n[00:02:00] Some people who take their kids to soccer, people who commute to work. I mean, all those people write, write big American ex big American Express or visa bills because of gasoline. Absolutely. The other thing that people don't take into account is EV sales are weak right now.\n\n[00:02:18] Lee Jackson: They are especially, for certain areas in certain companies.\n[00:02:24] Doug McIntyre: If you go back, to mid 2022, gasoline was at $5. Now, if you're trying to sell EVs, would you rather be selling to people in gases? $5. Or when it's 2.75 and dropping?\n[00:02:41] Lee Jackson: Well, I think your point is, was well grounded. And to be frank with you, I mean, I live in the south and I have for the bulk of my life and where I live here in Tupelo, Mississippi, which for those that are geographically challenged is in the\n[00:02:58] upper part of the state we're about a hundred miles from Memphis, so, which is in the southern part of Tennessee Gas here, 2.17, it'll be under $2 here. And the thing that, the reason that's relevant is that, in the northeast and in the east where you live, a lot of people get to work via train.\n\n[00:03:16] So especially you go going to the city and via train and that's common back east. But in Texas and places like that, most people drive half an hour, 40 minutes in from the suburbs, say Dallas, where I lived for 15 years. But if you live out in Plano or farther north or west in Arlington, that's a good 20, 30 minutes every single day.\n[00:03:39] And it's, it'll be a huge and gasoline's cheap all through the south. Part of it is because a lot of it's, there's a lot of refineries down here, especially in the Texas Gulf Coast. But, but even just to get it under $3 into 2.75 is huge. and the thing that's important for our viewers to remember is why is it still so high in California?\n[00:04:03] 'Cause they tax the hell out of it. It's just, they're so burdened out there with horrible debt a lot and from just ridiculous spending that, it's still, I think, three and a half, 4, 4.50 out in certain places in California.\n\n[00:04:18] Doug McIntyre: Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's over four. It's over four in good cities. it's over four.\n[00:04:22] Now, I don't want to draw a straight line between these two things because it's probably wouldn't be fair, but ev sales in California are awesome when it comes to per car sold, EVs do well. Why? I think part of the reason. Just gas. The price of gas Sure. And gas taxes in California.\n[00:04:44] Lee Jackson: Yeah. I would suspect you're correct, especially if you live in a, you don't live in LA or something like that,\n[00:04:50] you have a huge drive every day. But if you live in a smaller town, or, if you live central to your work, say in San Francisco, and you live someplace like that, yeah, I think I can see that it would continue to be stronger out there. Any place where the gas prices are higher, the whole West Coast, I'm sure is one of 'em.\n\n[00:05:12] Doug McIntyre: Well, if the American consumer needs something to offset increases in things like the price of food, at least fuel costs are dropping. And for those of us who aren't in Mississippi and are up north in Connecticut, dropping oil means dropping my heating bills down.\n[00:05:31] Lee Jackson: Oh, absolutely. Because well, heating oil's big up there still, right?\n[00:05:35] Yep. Oh, you bet. Well, I think it's just a positive and the thing is that I've read different stories and work on Exxon, that they literally can make money because of their additional businesses, which of course are chemicals, refining, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, retail, they can make money still on gas down to $30, which I was stunned by because for a lot of the people that are in the Permian, and they start to struggle at 50 and below.\n\n[00:06:12] So when I read that on Exxon, I was like, oh my god, that these guys are in the catbird seat. for lower prices, because what lower prices will do, it will increase consumption, and the OPEC Plus really, kinda they pulled their production increases a little bit longer than they should have.\n[00:06:35] And they knocked it down and the Brent pricing for them was knocked down bad, real bad. And they all of a sudden they said, whoa, let's tap the brakes on this production increases. We're just gonna hold where we're at. And I think they're gonna do that until they see prices start to at least stabilize 'cause I think they're gonna go lower in 26, maybe a while. Yeah. So kudos to the gasoline buying car public and good luck with the electric cars, except in, California, I guess. Yep.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "In recent days, Meta Platforms has outlined heavier spending on artificial intelligence, a planned cut of up to 30% in Metaverse investment, and the US$2.00 billion acquisition of AI agent startup Manus, while also facing fresh regulatory scrutiny over scam advertising practices in the US and Europe.\nThis mix of AI expansion, a shift back toward its core ad business, and rising compliance demands is reshaping how investors view Meta’s growth potential and risk profile.\nNext, we’ll examine how Meta’s decision to ramp up AI investment while trimming Metaverse spending could influence its existing investment narrative.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 29 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery . The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.\nMeta Platforms Investment Narrative Recap To own Meta today, you need to believe its AI heavy, ad centric model can keep compounding value even as regulation tightens and spending climbs. The most important short term catalyst is whether AI investments keep lifting engagement and ad yields enough to offset rising capital expenditure. The biggest current risk is regulatory pressure on scam advertising and identity checks, which could raise compliance costs and curb ad volumes; the recent headlines make that risk more immediate but not yet structurally different.\n\nThe Manus acquisition, at about US$2.0 billion, looks particularly relevant here because it extends Meta’s AI agent capabilities into commercial use cases that sit close to its core ad and business services. If Meta can integrate Manus across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, it could reinforce AI driven engagement and monetization at the same time that regulators are asking harder questions about how ads are targeted and verified.\nYet alongside Meta’s AI upside, investors should be aware of the growing regulatory push on scam ads and universal advertiser verification that could...\nRead the full narrative on Meta Platforms (it's free!)\nMeta Platforms' narrative projects $275.9 billion revenue and $92.1 billion earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "BYDDY\n\nGOOG\n\nBYDDF\n\nFor Immediate Releases Chicago, IL &ndash; January 6, 2026 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeTesla TSLA, BYD Co Ltd BYDDY and Alphabet&rsquo;s GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Tesla EV Deliveries Slide in 2025: Time to Sell TSLA Stock? Electric vehicle giant Tesla saw its annual deliveries decline for the second consecutive year in 2025. After deliveries declined in the first and second quarters of 2025, Tesla set a new delivery record in the third quarter, but much of it came from buyers rushing to claim the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit. Expiration of incentives, intense competition from Chinese EV makers, particularly BYD Co Ltd , and an aging fleet resulted in the year-over-year decline in Tesla deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as the full year.\n\nWhile TSLA&rsquo;s core EV business is struggling, CEO Elon Musk is pinning big hopes on autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, considering those as the next fuel engines for the company. However, meaningful revenues from these projects are years away.\nSo, in this scenario, should investors dump Tesla stock or still hold it tight on big long-term promises? Before that, let's dig deeper into TSLA&rsquo;s latest delivery numbers.\nTSLA Q4 & Full-Year Deliveries Disappoint In the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla sold 418,227 vehicles (comprising 406,585 Model 3/Y and 11,642 other models), down 16% from the corresponding quarter of 2024. For the full year, deliveries totaled roughly 1.64 million vehicles (comprising 1.58 million units of Model 3/Y and 50,850 other models). That denotes a decline from nearly 1.8 million vehicles sold in 2024.\n\nAnother thing to be noticed here is that the rate of sales decline has also increased in 2025. In 2024, deliveries were down 1% on a year-over-year basis. In 2025, the year-over-year decline was more than 8%.\nAnd with that, Tesla lost its EV crown to BYD, which overthrew Tesla for the first time on an annual basis. BYD logged record sales of 2.26 million BEVs in 2025, reflecting a 28% increase year over year.\nMusk&rsquo;s Pivot to Robotaxis & Robotics Musk is betting big on Full Self-Driving (FSD) and robotaxis, calling them Tesla&rsquo;s most valuable future segment. Its robotaxi service, launched in June, is currently operational in Austin and San Francisco, with Phoenix next after the company recently secured the required permits. Tesla has also outlined plans to expand into Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston and Miami. Notably, Tesla&rsquo;s FSD fleet has surpassed 7 billion total miles.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, Tesla has started testing driverless robotaxis without safety monitors, which investors see as proof of progress toward autonomous mobility. Musk has also announced that Tesla&rsquo;s in-car systems will integrate Grok, an AI chatbot, boosting confidence in Tesla&rsquo;s ability to monetize AI.\n\nThat said, competition in autonomy remains intense. Alphabet &rsquo;s Waymo continues to lead the autonomous ride-hailing race. Its entire fleet operates without safety drivers, and it recently surpassed 450,000 weekly paid rides. So, Tesla is still playing catch-up in the AV space.\nRegarding robotics, Tesla&rsquo;s humanoid robot project, Optimus, is seen as a long-term growth driver, adding to the narrative that Tesla is more than just an EV company.\nFlourishing Energy Business One key bright spot for the company is its Energy Generation and Storage business, which is going strong on the back of the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products. This segment also stands out as Tesla's most lucrative, boasting the highest margins. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed a record 14.2 GWh of energy storage products. For the full year, deployments rose 48.7% to 46.7 GWh.\n\nTSLA&rsquo;s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Over the past year, Tesla shares have underperformed the industry.\nThe company trades at more than 13.75X forward 12-month sales, far above the industry average. But Tesla has been one of those stocks whose valuation has long been divorced from its fundamentals. It has always traded at a premium, backed by promises of its long-term potential.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla&rsquo;s 2025 revenues and EPS implies a year-over-year contraction of 3% and 33%, respectively. But the consensus mark for 2026 top and bottom lines suggests an improvement of 11.6% and 42.4%, respectively, from the 2025 projected levels. See how TSLA&rsquo;s EPS estimates have been revised over the past 90 days.\nTesla Shares Worth Holding Onto Now Tesla&rsquo;s delivery slowdown highlights the growing pressure on its core EV business. But Tesla is not just an EV story now. While vehicle demand faces competition and incentive-related volatility, the company continues to make steady progress in full self-driving, robotaxis, and energy storage&mdash;areas that could reshape its long-term earnings mix. At the same time, ambitions around AI and humanoid robotics offer optionality that a few automakers can match, even if monetization remains years away.\n\nThat said, investors should temper expectations. Scaling robotaxis beyond pilot programs and turning AI-led projects into consistent revenue streams will take time.\nFor now, Tesla is a high-risk, high-reward stock. Long-term believers should stay invested, but fresh entry points may warrant patience. And if even part of Musk&rsquo;s vision comes together, TSLA could remain a winning stock for years to come.\nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.54 billion people daily. Meta Platforms&rsquo; growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>> )\n\nShares of Bank of America have gained +16.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry&rsquo;s gain of +17.3%. The company's net interest income (NII) will likely be aided by decent loan growth, despite rate cuts. The Zacks analyst expects NII to see a CAGR of 5.7% by 2027.\n\nPlans to open financial centers in new and existing markets, and improve digital capabilities will support the top line. We project total revenues to grow 6.9% in 2025. Yet the volatile nature of the capital markets makes growth in trading revenues uncertain. Despite a robust trading performance since 2022, growth may normalize going forward.\n\nWhile we expect sales and trading revenues to increase in 2025, the metric will likely decline in 2026. Elevated expenses due to steady investments in its franchise will likely hurt bottom-line growth. The Zacks analyst expects expenses to rise 4.3% in 2025. Weak asset quality is another obstacle.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>> )\n\nProcter & Gamble&rsquo;s shares have declined -10.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry&rsquo;s decline of -11%. The company&rsquo;s strong portfolio, innovations, and productivity efforts reinforce its ability to deliver sustainable growth. Earnings and sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year in Q1 fiscal 2026.\n\nPG expects 1&ndash;5% all-in sales growth and flat to up 4% organic sales gains in fiscal 2026, supported by cost savings. We expect organic sales to rise 2% in fiscal 2026. Robust cash flow funds dividends and share buybacks, with $15 billion planned shareholder returns in fiscal 2026.\n\nPG&rsquo;s consistent execution positions it well to balance growth, resilience, and shareholder value creation. However, elevated commodity costs, tariff pressures, higher interest expenses, and macroeconomic woes continue to weigh on margins and earnings visibility.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>> )\n\nShares of Espey Mfg. & Electronics have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Military industry over the past six months (+3.5% vs. -32.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $137.63 million record $141.1 million backlog, with 72% scheduled through 2028+, ensures revenue visibility despite a 12.9% Q1 FY26 sales decline.\n\nGross margin expanded to 35.4%, highlighting strong cost control and product mix advantages. Espey&rsquo;s core capabilities in rugged power electronics align with growing defense electronics demand amid global modernization trends. A clean balance sheet and consistent dividends, including a $1.00/share payout (4X prior year), underscore financial discipline and cash generation strength.\n\nRisks include high customer concentration (top 5 = 80% of sales), increased inventories (+18% YoY), and lower order intake relative to FY25. Inflationary pressure and reimbursement-dependent capex introduce near-term volatility.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Espey Mfg. & Electronics here >>> )\n\nNeurAxis&rsquo; shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry over the past six months (+65.2% vs. -16.2%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $47.51 million targets a large, underserved gut/brain disorder market with its FDA-cleared IB-Stim neuromodulation system, recently expanded to treat functional dyspepsia (FD), doubling its pediatric addressable market to $8 billion.\n\nNeurAxis&rsquo; non-invasive, drug-free profile, guideline inclusion and growing evidence support differentiation. Rapid reimbursement expansion and a permanent CPT Category I code effective January 2026 should improve provider economics and accelerate uptake. Revenue has grown at double-digit rates, but losses persist amid high spending, margin pressure and reliance on external capital.\n\nThe adult RED diagnostic adds diversification but remains early with execution risk. CPT implementation could unlock a revenue inflection in mid-to-late 2026, but near-term adoption frictions and liquidity pressure may temper upside.

Nevertheless, predictions can be entertaining and thought provoking. Additionally, investors can use historical data and probabilities to make &ldquo;educated guesses&rdquo; about the coming year, and at the very least, provide themselves with a potential roadmap. Below are five of my high probability predictions for 2026.\n1. The S&P 500 Index will Suffer a Correction of 10% or More During 2026: Historically, the S&P 500 suffers a 14% peak-to-trough correction roughly one time per year. After an above average return of 16.4% in 2025, investors should expect some potential profit taking along the way.\n2. The S&P 500 Index will Gain 10% or More in 2026: Recently, Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve made the rare and aggressive move of cutting interest rates with the S&P 500 Index at highs. According to Carson Research&rsquo;s Ryan Detrick, &ldquo;rate cuts near all-time highs have seen stocks higher a year later 20 out of 20 times.&rdquo; Meanwhile, stocks have enjoyed above average returns of 13.9% during these instances.\n\n3. More Companies will go Public in 2026 than in 2025: A stable macroeconomic climate, easing inflation, and the maturation of high-growth sectors will lead to more IPOs in 2026. SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic are rumored to go public in 2026. Meanwhile, a backlog of delayed IPOs will likely go public after market volatility-related delays.\n4. There will be no Third Wave of Inflation (CPI will Remain Below 4%): The biggest fear following the &lsquo;Liberation Day&rsquo; tariff unveil was that tariffs would cause inflation. However, what most investors got wrong was that large U.S. retailers like Amazon , Walmart and Costco would leverage their massive market share to force suppliers to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; tariff costs. Additionally, inflation refers to persistently higher prices, whereas the Trump Administration&rsquo;s tariffs are merely a one-time increase. Finally, energy, a large component of inflation, is likely to stay low due to rolled regulations and increased production.\n\nStory Continues\n5. GDP Will Soar to >3%: Easing monetary policy, reduced trade complications, and the biggest tax refunds in history will help to foster a robust economic client in 2026. Furthermore, the AI revolution will continue to drive the economy. For instance, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that Nvidia will grow EPS 55% year-over-year.\n\nMeanwhile, AI will move beyond large language models to physical AI gains in products like Tesla and Alphabet&rsquo;s robotaxi networks.\nBottom Line Predicting the future of financial markets is never an exact science, but by leaning on historical precedents and current economic tailwinds, we can navigate the uncertainty with greater confidence. While 2026 will undoubtedly bring its own set of surprises, the combination of a dovish Fed, a maturing AI sector, and resilient consumer suggests a year of significant expansion.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points The AI revolution is responsible for one of the strongest three-year rallies in the S&P 500's history.\nNvidia and Palantir have become the faces of the rise of AI thanks to their sustainable moats.\nHowever, the actions of insiders are sending mixed signals for the stock market's premier AI stocks.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nFor only the third time in the S&P 500 's existence, Wall Street's benchmark index has rallied at least 15% for three consecutive years. These outsize returns for Wall Street from 2023 through 2025 come courtesy of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nEmpowering software and systems with the ability to make split-second decisions without the need for human oversight is a technological leap forward that can eventually add trillions to global gross domestic product (GDP). From a hardware and applications standpoint, no two AI stocks are leading the charge quite like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) .\nDuring Wall Street's three-year, AI-driven bull market, Nvidia has added more than $4.2 trillion in market value, while shares of Palantir have skyrocketed by more than 2,500%! They've arguably become the faces of the AI movement.\nBut while their respective growth rates would suggest a fourth year of jaw-dropping gains may be in the cards, the actions of those who know Nvidia and Palantir best point to a different outcome in the new year.\nNvidia and Palantir possess sustainable moats However, before making predictions about the future, it's important to understand how we got to the point where Nvidia and Palantir are, essentially, at or near the center of the AI universe on Wall Street.\nThe outperformance of both companies can be traced back to their well-defined sustainable moats.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred option as the brains of AI-accelerated data centers -- and it's not even close. By some analyst estimates, Nvidia's Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra chips account for 90% or more of the GPUs currently deployed in enterprise data centers.\nNo externally developed GPUs have come particularly close to matching the compute capacity of what Nvidia's GPUs bring to the table. Furthermore, CEO Jensen Huang has kept his company on an aggressive innovation timeline that'll see a new advanced chip introduced during the second-half of each year. Progressively faster and more efficient GPUs will make it virtually impossible for other chipmakers to go toe-to-toe with Nvidia in AI data centers.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's CUDA software platform has played a crucial role in its success, as well. This toolkit, which developers use to maximize the compute potential of their Nvidia GPUs, keeps clients loyal to the brand.\nMeanwhile, Palantir Technologies is an AI-applications business that lacks a one-for-one replacement at scale.\n\nPalantir's lead operating segment is Gotham, an AI-driven software-as-a-service platform that the U.S. government and its allies rely on for military mission planning and oversight, as well as data collection and analysis. Many of Palantir's government contracts span four or five years, leading to highly predictable operating cash flow and a sustainable (and transparent) double-digit growth rate.\nThe company's other core operating segment, Foundry, caters to businesses. Foundry is an AI- and machine learning-powered platform that helps companies understand their data to streamline their operations. As a newer platform, Foundry has the potential to deliver outsize sales growth throughout the decade.\nWall Street and investors have demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium for public companies with sustainable moats.\nThe people who know Nvidia and Palantir best have a $3.3 billion warning for Wall Street in 2026 However, things don't always go the way that investors expect in the stock market. The actions of Nvidia's and Palantir's insiders in 2025 certainly raise some potential red flags for the new year.\nAn \"insider\" is a high-ranking company executive, member of the board of directors, or beneficial shareholder who may possess non-public information. For the sake of transparency and to follow all securities laws, insiders are required to file Form 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission within two business days of buying or selling their company's stock.\n\nBased on Form 4 filings in 2025, insiders at Nvidia and Palantir were decisive net sellers of their respective shares:\nNvidia : $2,164,822,949 in net selling activity\nPalantir : $1,146,687,533 in net selling activity\nCollectively, more than $3.3 billion worth of Wall Street's hottest AI stocks were sold by insiders last year.\nThe asterisk that should be placed next to the aforementioned figure is that not all insider selling is necessarily bad news for investors. Since most executives and board members are compensated in the form of shares or stock options, they'll often sell a portion of their shares or exercise their options and subsequently sell the shares to cover their federal and/or state income tax liability. Tax-based selling isn't something Wall Street or investors should worry too much about.\n\nAt the same time, insider buying has been almost nonexistent for both companies. The last time an Nvidia executive or board member bought shares was over five years ago, in December 2020. Meanwhile, only one executive/board member at Palantir purchased shares last year.\nAlthough several reasons exist to sell a stock, not all of which are nefarious, the only reason an insider would buy shares is if they believe the stock will head higher. The persistent lack of insider buying that we've observed with Nvidia and Palantir speaks volumes.\nAs we push ahead into 2026, keep in mind that no next-big-thing technology trend, for more than three decades, has avoided an early innings bubble-bursting event. While AI has been Wall Street's hottest trend for three years (and counting), AI isn't anywhere close to being a mature technology.\n\nFurthermore, history has shown that price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 for companies heralding the charge of a game-changing innovation aren't sustainable over long periods. Nvidia's P/S ratio briefly topped 30 in early November, while Palantir's P/S ratio is currently tipping the scales at 110!\nThe lack of insider buying, coupled with billions of dollars in annual insider selling, would appear to signal that neither Nvidia nor Palantir shares are attractive.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lam-research-lrcx-still-attractive-091434923.html",
      "Content": "If you are trying to figure out whether Lam Research is still good value after its strong run, you will want to look past the headlines and focus on what the current price really implies.\nThe stock last closed at US$194.76, with returns of 12.1% over 7 days, 22.7% over 30 days, 5.2% year to date and 153.5% over the past year, so many holders are already sitting on sizeable gains.\nRecent attention on semiconductor equipment makers like Lam Research has been closely linked to market interest in chip capacity and the build out of advanced manufacturing. News flow around sector investment plans and policy support for domestic chip production has kept Lam Research on many investors' watchlists.\nDespite this, Lam Research currently scores just 1 out of 6 on our valuation checks. In the sections ahead we will walk through traditional valuation approaches and finish with a way to think about value that goes beyond a single score.\n\nLam Research scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Lam Research Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company might be worth today by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to a present value.\nFor Lam Research, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month free cash flow is reported at about US$5.73b. Analyst and extrapolated projections, provided by Simply Wall St, run out to 2035, with forecast free cash flow in 2030 of about US$7.84b and a series of discounted values across the next ten years.\n\nBringing all those projected cash flows back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$66.01 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$194.76, this implies the stock is about 195.0% above the DCF estimate. On this metric, Lam Research screens as materially overvalued.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Lam Research may be overvalued by 195.0%. Discover 879 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Lam Research.\nApproach 2: Lam Research Price vs Earnings For profitable companies, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you pay directly to the earnings the business is currently generating. It is a simple shorthand for how many dollars investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat counts as a normal or fair P/E will usually depend on how fast earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk tends to point to a lower P/E.\nLam Research currently trades on a P/E of 42.10x, compared with the Semiconductor industry average of about 38.66x and a peer average of 43.47x. Simply Wall St also estimates a Fair Ratio of 33.32x, which is its proprietary view of what the P/E could be given Lam Research’s earnings growth, margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison to peers or the industry because it adjusts for those company specific factors. With the current P/E of 42.10x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 33.32x, the shares screen as overvalued on this measure.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1457 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Lam Research Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St’s Community page you can use Narratives, where you set the story you believe about Lam Research and link that story to your own forecast for revenue, earnings and margins. This then ties through to a Fair Value that you can compare with the current share price to help decide whether to buy or sell. Those Fair Values update automatically as new news or earnings arrive. One investor might build a bullish Lam Research Narrative around AI driven wafer fab equipment demand and arrive at a Fair Value well above the current price. Another might focus on risks like geopolitical tension, customer concentration and equipment spending cyclicality and set a much lower Fair Value. You can see these different viewpoints side by side, including the current analyst consensus Fair Value of US$160.30 and its spread of targets from US$80.00 to US$135.00.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Lam Research?

      "Content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is back in the spotlight after its CES 2026 keynote, where CEO Lisa Su introduced new AI data center GPUs, the Helios rack platform, and Ryzen AI chips for PCs and embedded systems.\nSee our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices.\nThose CES 2026 launches come after a period of mixed share price moves, with a 7 day share price return of 2.67% and a 90 day share price decline of 6.15%, yet a 1 year total shareholder return of 73.63% and a 3 year total shareholder return above 3x, indicating that longer term momentum has remained strong even as short term sentiment has cooled.\n\nIf AMD's AI push has your attention, this can be a good moment to scan other chip names riding similar themes through high growth tech and AI stocks and see what else stands out.\nWith AMD now trading at US$221.08, sitting at a roughly 32% intrinsic discount and about 28% below the average analyst target, you have to ask yourself whether this is a fresh entry point or whether the market is already baking in future growth.\nMost Popular Narrative: 18.1% Undervalued According to oscargarcia, the narrative points to a fair value of about US$270 per share, compared with AMD's last close at US$221.08, framing the stock as materially below that estimate.\nRead the complete narrative.\nWant to see what underpins that higher fair value line? The narrative leans heavily on faster revenue expansion, richer margins, and a profit multiple usually linked with top tier AI names. Curious which specific assumptions power that model through 2030 and how they tie back to data center demand and AI racks rather than PCs alone? The full breakdown lays out those moving parts in detail.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $270 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, there are still clear pressure points, including Nvidia's lead in high end AI GPUs and export controls that could affect margins and slow AI chip demand.\nFind out about the key risks to this Advanced Micro Devices narrative.\nAnother Way To Look At AMD's Valuation Our DCF model identifies AMD as undervalued, with the current price of US$221.08 sitting about 31.9% below an estimated fair value of US$324.80. This supports the view that the stock may be underpriced, but it also raises a question: are the long term growth and margin assumptions here too optimistic, or are they about right for you?\n\nStory Continues\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nBuild Your Own Advanced Micro Devices Narrative If you look at the numbers and reach a different conclusion, or simply prefer to test your own assumptions, you can build a personalised AMD view in just a few minutes with Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Advanced Micro Devices research is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards and 1 important warning sign that could impact your investment decision.\n\nLooking for more investment ideas? If AMD has sharpened your interest in AI and high growth themes, you do not have to stop here. You can widen your watchlist with targeted stock ideas.\nSpot potential high growth names early by scanning these 3554 penny stocks with strong financials that already show stronger balance sheets and fundamentals than many peers.\nZero in on AI focused businesses by checking these 25 AI penny stocks that are tied directly to machine learning, data processing, and automation themes.\nHunt for possible mispriced opportunities using these 879 undervalued stocks based on cash flows where current prices sit below cash flow based estimates.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Speaking at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, she showcased the company's latest AI hardware and held up new chips for the crowd to see. \"MI455 is the most advanced chip we've ever built. It's pretty darn big. It has 320 billion transistors, 70% more than MI355.\" These chips power data‑center racks that AMD sells to firms like OpenAI. The president of the ChatGPT-maker, Greg Brockman, joined Su on stage. He said chip advances were vital to OpenAI's vast needs for computing power. Su also had big claims for another platform: \"So let me tell you what it is. This is the smallest AI development system in the world, capable of running models with up to 200 billion parameters locally not connected to anything.\" AMD remains Nvidia's top rival in AI chips, but trails in market share. A recent deal with OpenAI has been seen as a show of confidence in the company. :: NVIDIA But analysts say it's unlikely to dent the dominance of Nvidia, which showed off its own new chips the same day.

      "Content": "^GSPC\n\nKey Points Nvidia holds a dominant share of the data center GPU market.\nThe company's extensive library of developer tools provides a powerful competitive advantage.\nNvidia is pricey by some metrics, but isn't as expensive as it appears.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nLast year was something of a roller-coaster ride for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. The stock continued the bull run that began back in early 2023 when the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for running artificial intelligence (AI) applications in data centers. Despite fears of rising competition, Nvidia closed out 2025 in strong fashion, gaining 39% for the year, more than twice the 16% increase for the S&P 500 .\nHowever, investors are looking to the future and asking the quintessential investing question. In the wake of the company's strong performance in recent years, is it too late to buy Nvidia stock as we head into 2026? Let's examine the available evidence to see what it reveals.\nA position of strength Nvidia continues to operate from a position of strength, despite encroaching competition (more on that in a bit). CEO Jensen Huang recognized the increasing potential of AI as early as 2013 and positioned the company to capitalize on the wave of AI adoption, paving the way for future success.\nDon't take my word for it. Nvidia dominates the data center GPU market with a 92% share, according to IoT Analytics. Furthermore, the company adopted an annual product development and release cadence that makes it extremely difficult for competitors to gain ground.\n\nTactical advantage -- Nvidia There's been a lot of talk about the increasing competition in the AI space, and that certainly appears to have some merit.\nWhile Amazon has been developing its own homegrown AI processors for years, the company recently launched its Trainium 3 chip, which Amazon claims is 4 times faster, boasts 4 times more memory, and is 40% more energy-efficient than its predecessor.\n\nAlphabet 's Google debuted its first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in 2015 and released the seventh-generation Ironwood TPU late last year. The company notes that the latest version offers peak performance 10 times that of the fifth version and 4 times the improvement compared to version six.\nAdvanced Micro Devices -- Nvidia's most oft-cited rival -- released its MI350 processors last year, which offer 4 times better performance than the prior version. Furthermore, the company's MI400 series of rack-scale processors, which are due out this year, is being touted as the best yet for AMD.\n\nStory Continues\nYet Nvidia maintains a competitive moat that was years in the making. The company's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is an extensive library of software tools that help developers get the best performance out of Nvidia's GPUs. CUDA is widely acknowledged as the gold standard for GPU programming and is used by more than 4.5 million developers, creating a powerful network effect and a unique competitive advantage that will keep its rivals at bay for years to come.\n\nIs Nvidia overvalued? Some investors would argue that Nvidia stock is pricey, and that view is certainly understandable, given the stock currently trades for 46 times earnings. However, taking a step back suggests that view is also myopic.\nNvidia has risen 1,200% over the past three years, and growth of that magnitude shows why the stock is deserving of a premium. Additionally, the most commonly used valuation metrics struggle to value high-growth stocks. The more appropriate price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio returns a multiple of 0.78 -- when any number less than 1 is the standard for an undervalued stock. Furthermore, the stock is trading for a much more reasonable multiple of 25 times next year's earnings.\n\nIts growth streak is expected to continue. For its fiscal 2026 (which ends in late January), Nvidia is on track to increase revenue by 63% and earnings per share (EPS) by 59% -- despite heavy investment in the next generation of AI-centric processors. Furthermore, Wall Street expects the company to grow its revenue by 50% in fiscal 2027.\nTaken together, Nvidia's strong competitive position, proven track record, and robust growth prospects suggest that the stock remains a buy heading into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "MoneyDJ新聞 2026-01-06 14:55:34 新聞中心 發佈\n\n在半導體龍頭台積電(2330)帶動下，台股漲勢強勁，不過相對股市熱潮，「台積宅」卻表現冷淡。住商機構根據實價登錄統計，台積電進駐園區周邊行政區房價皆呈現盤整或凍漲，僅嘉義太保、朴子仍維持漲勢。大家房屋企劃研究室公關襄理賴志昶指出，近期面臨政府管控，買方追價意願明顯下滑，因此過往交易熱區也出現價格盤整。\n\n根據統計，台積電所在的新竹科學園區、中部科學園區台中園區、南部科學園區台南園區及楠梓產業園區等四大園區中，周邊房市在2025年皆呈凍漲或是跌勢。以新竹科學園區周邊為例，新竹市房價雖呈現持平，惟過往為一級房市熱區的新竹縣竹北市，房價則微幅下修2.8%；至於中部則呈現較大波動，如台中市沙鹿區出現10.8%的明顯跌幅；南二都方面，則以台南園區周邊跌勢較明顯，其中善化區房價更修正達6.5%，而楠梓產業園區周邊的橋頭、仁武區，房價下滑力道也達3%以上。\n\n賴志昶分析，這些具半導體龍頭題材區域，過往受惠科技紅利，房市在疫情後快速轉紅，加諸當時市場熱錢流動，區域房價漲勢凌厲，惟過往房價基期太高，且部分區域更有提早反映未來房價的趨勢，並在面臨限貸緊縮，投資置產買方轉趨觀望下，市場回歸剛性供需，價格則進入盤整階段。\n\n不過，根據數據，在這波科技園區房市盤整潮中，南部科學園區嘉義園區周邊行政區卻逆勢飆升，其中，嘉義縣太保市2025年平均房價較前一年大漲41.3%，朴子市也有9.5%的漲幅。\n\n住商不動產嘉義故宮南院加盟店店東吳宗翰分析，過往此區域中古房市長期穩定，近期高鐵特區周邊開發逐漸起色，除有半導體產業鏈進駐，也吸引多個品牌建商插旗，加諸未來還有OUTLET將設於高鐵站前，讓周便房市價量齊揚，未來隨著利多消息持續發酵，當地房市仍有期待空間。\n\n賴志昶提醒，近期台股表現強勢，但過往「股房連動」效應，在政府打房、限貸之下已逐漸鈍化，而過往置產族群習慣「跟著園區買房」，但從數據可發現，房價過熱的區域已進入高原期，市場上揚力道有限；因此，購屋族在置產此類題材時，應回歸基本盤，以免讓房市「明燈」變成「冥燈」，當市場驟然翻轉，徒然面臨資產緊縮的風險。",

      "Content": "（中央社記者江明晏台北2026年1月6日電）台股連2天創高，指數今天開低震盪後翻紅，終場上漲471.26點，收在最高點30576.3點，再創紀錄；台積電終場上漲35元，收1705元再飆天價，面板、記憶體、PCB等族群強勢。\n\n展望後市，分析師指出，台股延續多頭格局，主流依然集中AI題材，元月行情暫時未見烏雲。\n\n美國華爾街股市4大指數全部走揚，其中道瓊工業指數收盤再創歷史新高。台股今天開低171點，下探29933.65點，隨後跌勢迅速收斂，重回3萬點關卡。\n\n台股加權指數終場上漲471.26點，收在最高點30576.3點，漲幅1.57%，成交金額新台幣7335.47億元。電子股漲1.94%，金融股跌0.01%、櫃買指數漲1.2%，台股指數連2天創歷史新高。\n\n觀察權值股走勢，台積電漲35元，收1705元，再創新高，漲幅2.1%。鴻海漲0.64%、聯發科收黑，日月光投控、國巨勁揚逾3%。\n\n中小型股強勢，記憶體族群勁揚，南亞科、旺宏收漲停、華邦電漲近9%；面板股群創、友達漲停；PCB族群華通、泰鼎-KY漲停。\n\n觀察高價股走勢，創意漲逾7%，群聯收漲停，雙鴻平盤，力守千元大關，印能跌破千元關卡，台股以29千金股作收。\n\n萬寶投顧執行長王榮旭對中央社記者表示，在全球股市同步走揚帶動下，台股延續多頭格局，指數再創新高，昨天由電子股領軍大漲，今天早盤電子族群表現相對偏弱，但金融與傳產股接棒補漲，下檔支撐力道充足，顯示市場氛圍仍偏多，唯一需要留意的是，短線漲幅已大，震盪整理的壓力隨之浮現。\n\n王榮旭認為，台股目前尚未出現轉弱跡象，市場主流依然集中在AI相關題材。今年台積電CoWoS產能將倍增，下游AI基礎建設需求持續擴大，帶動記憶體、PCB、光通訊等族群輪動表現。今天盤面上，記憶體續強，面板、AI機器人、矽晶圓等基期相對較低的個股接棒輪動；其中，記憶體漲價效應也推升多項電子產品價格，AI帶動的效益擴散範圍相當廣泛，多頭格局並未改變。\n\n展望1月股市走勢，王榮旭指出，市場將關注幾項重要變數，包括美國聯準會（Fed）會後聲明，以及美國總統川普屬意Fed主席人選，均可能牽動未來利率走向；此外，台積電15日的法說會預期將釋出相當正面的展望。整體來看，元月行情暫時未見烏雲，即將公布的美國非農就業報告，仍需觀察市場將如何解讀。",

      "Content": "Sony-Honda JV Unveils AFEELA Prototype 2026, Targets U.S. Launch by 2028\n\nCharles Kennedy\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 9:21 PM PST 4 min read\n\nSony Honda Mobility on Monday unveiled the AFEELA Prototype 2026 at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, marking the latest step in the joint venture&rsquo;s effort to blend electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and digital entertainment into a new mobility platform.\nThe prototype, which builds on the AFEELA 1 pre-production model, is intended as the basis for a second production vehicle expected to launch in the U.S. market as early as 2028. SHM reiterated that customer deliveries of AFEELA 1 in California are scheduled to begin in 2026, with an expansion to Arizona planned for 2027.\n\nThe announcements underscore the ambition of Sony Group and Honda Motor to position their mobility venture at the intersection of automotive manufacturing, software-defined vehicles, and entertainment ecosystems&mdash;an increasingly competitive space as automakers and technology firms race to define the next generation of electric and autonomous vehicles.\nAFEELA 1, first revealed as a concept at CES 2023, is now entering its commercialization phase. SHM said reservations opened in California in January 2025, drawing more than 100,000 visitors to AFEELA Studio showrooms and generating over 24,000 in-vehicle demonstrations during the first year.\nTrial production runs were completed in late 2025 at Honda&rsquo;s East Liberty Auto Plant in Ohio, where the vehicle will be contract-manufactured. Pre-production units were showcased at CES 2026, signaling readiness for scaled manufacturing.\n\nTo support deliveries and customer engagement, SHM plans to open combined showroom and delivery hubs in Torrance and Fremont, California, this spring. Early reservation holders will be offered a phased experiential program, including demo drives later this year.\nAt the center of SHM&rsquo;s strategy is its concept of &ldquo;Mobility as a Creative Entertainment Space.&rdquo; The company envisions vehicles evolving from driver-focused machines into AI-enabled environments that use time spent in transit for entertainment, interaction, and productivity.\nKey to that vision is AFEELA Intelligent Drive, SHM&rsquo;s advanced driver assistance system. The company said it is evolving the system toward an end-to-end AI model incorporating vision-language technologies, beginning with Level 2+ driver assistance and ultimately targeting Level 4&ndash;equivalent capabilities.\nSHM also confirmed it will adopt Qualcomm Technologies&rsquo; Snapdragon Digital Chassis in its next-generation electrical and electronic architecture, aligning with a broader industry shift toward centralized computing platforms and software-defined vehicles.\n\nStory Continues\nIn parallel, the AFEELA Personal Agent&mdash;powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service&mdash;is designed to act as a conversational interface that adapts to individual users, reinforcing Sony&rsquo;s long-standing strengths in interactive entertainment and content.\nBeyond hardware, SHM is pushing to build an open developer ecosystem. The newly announced AFEELA Co-Creation Program will provide creators with access to development documentation and tools for in-vehicle entertainment, including Android-based infotainment applications.\n\nMore controversially, SHM also outlined plans for an on-chain mobility service platform using a token-based incentive model. The proposed &ldquo;X-to-Earn&rdquo; framework would support ideation, development, and user evaluation of mobility services, and could be opened to other automakers and service providers.\nWhile still conceptual, the move reflects growing experimentation across the auto and tech sectors with digital ecosystems, data monetization, and user engagement models beyond traditional vehicle sales.\nSony Honda Mobility was formed in 2022 as the partners sought to combine Honda&rsquo;s manufacturing scale and safety expertise with Sony&rsquo;s capabilities in sensors, software, gaming, and media. The venture faces competition from Tesla, legacy automakers accelerating their EV and ADAS programs, and new entrants emphasizing software-first vehicle design.\n\nWith AFEELA 1 nearing initial deliveries and a second model already mapped out, SHM is signaling that it intends to be a long-term player in the global EV and autonomous mobility race rather than a one-off technology showcase.\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nTop Chinese Offshore Gas Field Ships 100th Oil Cargo\nCoal Remains King in India While Exports Optimize Domestic Stock\nIndia to Leverage Russian Oil Import Data in Trade Deal Negotiations\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

      "Content": "CRWV\n\nAt CES 2026, NVIDIA unveiled its next-generation Rubin AI platform, six tightly integrated chips led by the Vera CPU and Rubin GPU, now in full production and slated for broad deployment by major cloud providers and AI labs from the second half of 2026.\nBy pairing Rubin with ecosystem moves such as Red Hat’s Day 0 support, CoreWeave’s planned Rubin roll-out, and new BlueField-4-based context memory and robotics and autonomous driving stacks, NVIDIA is pushing AI toward rack-scale “AI factories” spanning data centers, vehicles, and physical robots.\nWe'll now examine how Rubin’s rack-scale, full-stack AI design and ecosystem adoption could reshape NVIDIA's existing investment narrative.\n\nUncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward .\nNVIDIA Investment Narrative Recap To own NVIDIA, you have to believe that AI infrastructure spending remains robust enough for the company to monetize its full stack Rubin “AI factory” roadmap, while it manages mounting competition and regulatory scrutiny. The CES 2026 Rubin launch supports the near term catalyst of hyperscaler and AI lab deployments from the second half of 2026, while the biggest current risk is that hyperscalers’ in house chips and any slowdown in AI capex could erode that demand.\n\nAmong the recent announcements, Red Hat’s Day 0 support for the Rubin platform looks especially relevant, because it reinforces Rubin as an enterprise grade standard across hybrid cloud, not just a new GPU. If Rubin based racks ship into major clouds as planned, this Red Hat integration could help sustain NVIDIA’s AI data center narrative even if individual customers push harder on custom silicon.\nYet behind the Rubin excitement, investors should also be aware that concentrated hyperscaler demand and their own custom chip efforts could...\nRead the full narrative on NVIDIA (it's free!)\nNVIDIA's narrative projects $337.2 billion revenue and $187.9 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how NVIDIA's forecasts yield a $253.02 fair value , a 34% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives Four hundred fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$104 to US$341.

      "Content": "據《MarketWatch》報導，英特爾 (Intel)(INTC-US) 股價剛走過近 20 年來表現最亮眼的年份之一，而在一名最新轉為看多的分析師看來，漲勢還沒結束。\n\nMelius Research 分析師 Ben Reitzes 認為，英特爾的晶圓代工業務比以往更具吸引力，這可能推動股價再上漲 27%。他對公司逐步建立的夥伴關係印象深刻，認為未來幾年可望轉化為更多的晶片製造訂單。\n\nReitzes 將英特爾股票評級由中立調升至買進，並在周一 (5 日) 寫道，「我們真的很喜歡 (執行長) 陳立武 (Lip-Bu Tan)，但更重要的是，像是總統川普、商務部長盧特尼克 (Howard Lutnick)、輝達執行長黃仁勳，甚至 AMD 執行長蘇姿丰，這些有力的人都更喜歡他作為商業夥伴。」\n\n他表示，有「相當大的機會」讓輝達 (Nvidia)(NVDA-US)——去年已對英特爾投資 50 億美元——以及蘋果 (AAPL-US)，在 2028/2029 年「認真評估」以 14A 製程節點生產晶片。他補充稱，市場可能在今年更反映這項動態，進而「推升股票帳面價值」。\n\n在伺服器與個人電腦的中央處理器 (CPU) 領域，超微 (Advanced Micro Devices, AMD)(AMD-US) 是英特爾的競爭對手，但 Reitzes 認為，即便是 AMD，也可能為了爭取政治加分，而選擇與英特爾進行部分製造合作，因為英特爾是唯一能生產先進晶片的美國本土晶圓代工廠。\n\nReitzes 指出，即將到來的 14A 製程技術「預期將比 18A 更貼近客戶需求。18A 主要仍以英特爾自家產品為主」。\n\n他給出的 50 美元目標價，意味著英特爾股價約為帳面價值的 2 倍，「相較台積電仍是非常便宜」。根據 FactSet，台積電 (TSM-US)ADR 目前交易價格約是帳面價值的 10.3 倍。\n\n英特爾近年試圖重塑其代工業務，利用閒置產能替競爭對手代工晶片。目前為止，這項嘗試仍是燒錢的生意，但公司正努力提升技術，並把握美國政府希望重振本土晶片製造的政策方向。\n\n不過，未來一年英特爾仍面臨挑戰，尤其是自家晶片業務。記憶體零組件價格飆升，可能在 2026 年壓抑 PC 市場需求，Reitzes 認為，這股趨勢恐影響英特爾的客戶端運算事業。\n\n他如此說明自己的新觀點，「這次轉趨看多，較多是著眼於 2026 年期間，隨著市場對代工資產的評價轉為更樂觀，帳面價值上行的潛力。」\n\n此外，Reitzes 也將邁威爾科技 (Marvell Technology)(MRVL-US) 的股票評級調升至買進，稱該公司為大型雲端業者提供客製化晶片，而「身處一個很棒的產業位置」。\n\n他表示，邁威爾的客製晶片訂單積壓正在增加，並看好其 2027 年營收可望因微軟 MAIA 加速器相關工作，以及 XPU-attach 的擴產而倍增。邁威爾所稱的 XPU attach，指的是非處理器元件，如協同處理器與互連產品。Reitzes 補充稱，邁威爾今年與亞馬遜在客製晶片上的合作，可能帶來「相對更溫和」的 20% 左右成長。\n\n雖然他認為在共封裝光學 (CPO) 市場，邁威爾可能會讓出部分市占給博通 (Broadcom)(AVGO-US)，但該領域的成長動能正快速升溫，仍將成為邁威爾的重要驅動力。\n\n更多鉅亨報導&bull;英特爾CES推新一代PC晶片 首款18A產品拚重拾投資人信心&bull;傳輝達停用18A製程 如何影響英特爾2026年股價？",

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nAMD ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su unveiled the company's upcoming AI data center platform during her keynote at CES 2026 in Las Vegas on Monday, providing a first look at the Helios system and offering more details about how it will be built.\nSu not only brought out a large Helios rack unit on stage, but also said it was the \"world's best AI rack,\" a direct shot across Nvidia's bow.\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) has set the standard for rack scale systems and debuted its latest offering, the Vera Rubin NVL72, at CES on Monday .\nHelios will go head-to-head with Nvidia’s own NVL systems, matching its latest NVL72’s 72 Rubin GPUs with 72 of AMD’s MI455X chips. It’s another sign that AMD is working to move further in on Nvidia’s turf in the AI data center market.\nThe company expanded on that effort by providing more information about its upcoming MI500 series data center GPUs, which AMD boldly declares will provide up to a 1,000x increase in AI performance compared to its MI300X GPUs.\nAccording to Su, that kind of performance jump will be necessary over the coming years. During her keynote, the CEO said AMD believes some 5 billion people will be using AI every day in the next 5 years, and to meet that demand, technology companies will need to increase global computing capacity by 100 times in the coming years.\nThat kind of growth could undoubtedly benefit AMD and Nvidia.\nAMD has benefited handsomely from both its AI data center businesses over the last year. The company’s stock price increased 76% over the last 12 months, outpacing even that of Nvidia, which rose 30%.\n\nStill, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI industry, increasing its market capitalization to $4.5 trillion. AMD’s market cap sits at $359 billion.\nLike Nvidia and Intel ( INTC ), AMD also showcased its work in the robotics space, with Su bringing Generative Bionics CEO Daniele Pucci on stage to unveil the company’s humanoid robot for the first time.\n\nPowered by AMD’s CPUs and GPUs, the robot, dubbed GENE.01, is meant to operate in industrial environments. AMD is an investor in Generative Bionics.\nOn the PC front, Su announced that AMD's latest Ryzen AI 400 Series and Ryzen AI Pro 400 series chips will take on Intel’s new Core Ultra 3 processors built on its new 18A process technology.\nAccording to AMD, the chips come with up to 12 high-performance CPU cores for consumers that need oodles of processing power, as well as AMD’s integrated Radeon 800M series graphics chips, and an NPU with up to 60 TOPs of performance. TOPs, or trillions of operations per second, are a means for measuring AI processing performance.\n\nStory Continues\nAll of that, the company says, means users can expect multi-day battery life and strong AI and gaming capabilities.\nThe company also showed off its latest Ryzen AI Max+ chips for premium light laptops, workstations, and mini-PCs, as well as its new Ryzen AI Halo developer platform. Essentially a mini desktop PC, the computer is designed to help developers build AI models locally rather than in the cloud.\nThe Halo developer platform goes up against Nvidia’s rival DGX Spark mini-PC, which costs $3,999. AMD didn’t reveal pricing for Halo.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "即時中心／綜合報導\n\n輝達（NVIDIA）創辦人暨執行長黃仁勳週一（5日）在拉斯維加斯CES（美國消費性電子展）開幕主題演講中，發表全新Rubin平台，點名台積電就是幕後關鍵推手之一，並透露現已全面投產。此外，黃仁勳還宣布推出針對醫療、機器人和自動駕駛的開放模型，並發表具備思考與推理能力的全新自駕車AI技術「Alpamayo」。\n\n黃仁勳週一登上拉斯維加斯楓丹白露酒店舞台進行演講，為2026年CES揭開序幕。他宣稱，AI正在擴展至每個領域與每台設備中，「由於加速運算與人工智慧的發展，運算模式已發生根本性的重塑。」黃仁勳認為，「這意味著過去十年約 10 兆美元規模的運算基礎設施，正逐步現代化、並轉向這種全新的運算方式。」\n\n演講中黃仁勳揭曉Rubin平台，這是輝達首款極端共同設計（Extreme codesign）、具備六晶片的AI平台，目前已全面投入量產。他解釋極致共同設計–即同時設計所有這些組件–至關重要，因為要將AI擴展至吉瓦（Gigascale）級規模，需要跨晶片、機盤、機架、網路、儲存與軟體的緊密整合創新，以消除瓶頸、並大幅降低訓練與推理成本。\n\n黃仁勳認為，在摩爾定律放緩、電晶體成長受限的現實下，單靠製程微縮已無法支撐AI所需的效能躍進；必須在整個系統、晶片與軟體堆疊層級同步創新，才能突破效能天花板。\n\n同時，黃仁勳還點名台積電就是Vera Rubin平台的幕後關鍵推手之一。他指出，輝達與台積電從先進製程、先進封裝一路延伸至光電整合，展開深度協同設計，並採用台積電最新的COUPE技術，將矽光子技術直接導入交換晶片。他提到，「訓練 AI 模型越快，就能越快將下一個前沿技術帶給世界。這決定了你的產品上市時間，也是技術領先地位的體現。」\n\n輝達的開放模型在自家超級電腦上訓練，正推動醫療、氣候科學、機器人、具身智慧及自動駕駛等領域的突破。（圖／輝達提供）\n\n黃仁勳重申，AI 的未來不僅止於超級電腦，它更是「個人化」與「具身化」的。為將這些強大能力帶到個人終端，輝達推出 DGX Spark 桌面超級電腦，這台精巧的設備具備1 petaflop的AI運算效能，支持在本地端執行2,000億參數規模的大型模型，能讓個人AI代理（AI Agent）即時驅動實體機器人，實現流暢的人機協作。\n\n另外，黃仁勳也介紹 Cosmos開放世界基礎模型，該模型能從單張影像或文字描述生成真實物理模擬影片，讓機器人在進入現實世界前，先在虛擬環境中完成數十萬次的強化訓練。\n\n在本次CES演講中，黃仁勳還首度公開新一代自動駕駛AI架構「Alpamayo」，這是一個專為自動駕駛開發的開放推理模型系列，以實現Level 4等級的自動駕駛。黃仁勳在現場展示Alpamayo如何讓車輛在舊金山混亂的車流中，像「人類老司機」般進行判斷，該技術將率先搭載於賓士新款CLA轎車上，實現具備AI定義駕駛功能的Level 4級別自動駕駛，並預計於今年在美國正式上市。\n\n首度公開的新一代自動駕駛AI架構「Alpamayo」，這是一個專為自動駕駛開發的開放推理模型系列，以實現Level 4等級的自動駕駛。（圖／輝達提供）\n\n《民視新聞網》提醒您：內容僅供參考，投資人於決策時應審慎評估風險，並就投資結果自行負責。\n\n原文出處：快新聞／黃仁勳CES宣布Vera Rubin全面量產！談關鍵推手「正是台積電」\n\n更多民視新聞報導黃仁勳曝輝達新AI！將應用賓士「這系統」喊：實體AI已經到來藍白卡預算！國民黨縣市長竟喊「中央撥款」 林楚茵：賊喊抓賊綠營花蓮縣長人選已定？挑戰終結「傅氏王朝」統治 縣黨部表態了",

      "Content": "GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nGM\n\nWhen Jeff Bezos stepped aside in 2021, the Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) founder handed the keys to Andy Jassy , a longtime insider whose leadership philosophy was shaped long before boardrooms — by lessons from his father.\nFrom Early Amazon Employee To Bezos' Chosen Successor Jassy became Amazon's second CEO in July 2021, marking a rare leadership transition at one of the world's most powerful companies.\nJassy joined Amazon in 1997 — the same year it went public — and spent decades rising through the ranks before founding Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006.\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nAWS would become Amazon's most profitable engine and by the time Jassy stepped down as its CEO in 2021, the cloud unit had grown into a roughly $40 billion annual business.\nThat track record made him Bezos's clear choice to lead the $2.49 trillion e-commerce and cloud giant.\nThe Childhood Lessons That Still Guide Amazon's CEO In a 2022 Amazon-hosted fireside chat, Jassy said his biggest influence growing up wasn't a business leader — it was his father.\nJassy described his dad as a thoughtful, humble and hardworking man who quietly taught him accountability and discipline.\nOne lesson stuck from watching his father carefully sign checks and receipts. When Jassy asked why he took so much time, his father told him never to assume he was too important for others to read his name — a reminder, Jassy said, that no one is above accountability.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAnother moment came at a childhood soccer game, when Jassy's father challenged him to run a mile. After finishing slowly and proudly declaring success, Jassy recalled his father responding bluntly: If you're going to do something halfway, don't do it at all.\n\"He doesn’t remember saying that either, but it always stuck with me that if you’re gonna do something, do it right or don’t do it. And so he just was a great role model my whole life,\" Jassy said, explaining that those lessons still play like \"tapes\" in the back of his mind when he makes decisions today.\nInside Andy Jassy's First-Year CEO Pay Package Amazon disclosed that Jassy earned $212.7 million in total compensation in 2021, his first year as CEO. Nearly all of it came from restricted stock that vests over 10 years, designed to incentivize long-term performance. His base salary remained $175,000.\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nJassy officially took over on July 5, 2021, coinciding with the 27th anniversary of the company's incorporation.\nAmazon shares closed at an adjusted $159.90 on July 7, 2021, and were trading at $232.53 as of Tuesday's close, marking a roughly 45% gain since Jassy assumed leadership.\n\nRead Next: Missed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs?

      "Content": "台股上3萬點，被問到房市是否會被帶動？房市投資比不上股票市場！「房產總司令」戴德梁行顏炳立今（6）日在一場記者會前受訪表示，台積電漲80元需要千億資金，房市不像股市有高流動性，資金找熱標的，錢已離開，房市馬上熱機率不大，未來二年找低價「是不可能的任務」並不適合投資。他認為今年房市馬不奔，「價要先降，量才會出來」，房價蛋黃區估只會修正5%上下，雙北外房價頂多降一成「蛋白區冷過蛋黃區」，預售屋降價機率不高。\n\n戴德梁行上午舉2025 年度房地產市場回顧及2026年趨勢預測，顏炳立看好工業用地持續翻轉向上，他說，限貸令下市場仍有量，主要因為科技設廠，因此企業主、科技業仍在購地，工業土地是「一個人的武林」，持續增長，也讓六都工業土地出現翻商。\n\n至於商用市場緩下來，也受預售市場不好所致，他估今年土地市場交易健康約在1600億元、商用土地約在1400億元規模，收益率不高下，法人想要買高報酬不動產量也縮手。\n\n他說，2025年底來看房市「買氣斷量縮，價沒動」，去年量被血洗後並沒有失溫，全年估約26萬棟左右，仍高於2016年史上最 的24.5萬棟，顯示民間購買力仍興旺，但沒有投機客進來，因此房市良性健康，展望2026年，他認為成交量維持約26萬棟的溫和穩下來。\n\n「2026價要先降量才會出來，房市也才會生信心」。顏炳立說，雙北除非很偏僻或房價過高、商品本身有問題，價格會比較平穩，蛋黃區估只會修正5%上下；至於雙北以外房價被熱炒上來的應該要做一些修正，幅度也不大約在10%以內。建商開新案持穩下來，除非土地取得較早，才有讓利的空間，因此「預售屋要降價的機率不大」。\n\n今年房市成交量要增加，顏炳立建議央行要鬆綁對第二戶的控管，他說央行打壓的掌控與打目標都已達標，「民眾對房價上漲的期待已經沒有了」，而且房市也冷了、量也縮了，三是價格要下來需要時間，經一整年洗禮後，沒有太多小建商「從點變線」造成大災難，銀行逾放很低、建商資金管控也佳，房屋淪落法拍也很快被買走。因此他認為明年房市「量」很溫和不失溫，價向下幅度有限，但展望仍樂觀。\n\n至於台股上3萬點，他提及市場資金轉動速度快，資金不只從比特幣、黃金、白銀、銅，又回到股票市場，資金在追逐有利獲利非常積極，過去從一年都是從台積電開始，只要漲個25元，指數漲2、3百點，投資人信心就回來。他說，昨天台積電漲80元需要千億元資金，民間資金幾兆元相當熱絡，房市受人為政策管制所影響，並不是銀行內真的沒錢，他說2024年當時房市高達35萬棟，難道都是剛性需求？政府提供很低成本的資金及負擔，2024年是很明顯的炒作，他說，看房市是不是炒作？只要看房價「蛋殼區賣蛋白價、蛋白賣蛋黃價」，他說這不是炒作是什麼呢？資金熱到把銀行法72之2條的房貸都貸光了，今明年完工仍撐得住，代表資金是很高的。\n\n但是去年從35萬棟縮到26萬棟，他認為房市不像股市擁有高流動性，不認為未來二年適合投資房地產，股市買錯一、二天就出來了，房市交割至少一個月等，沒那麼多接盤俠，剛性需求都是找合理價，投資要找低價「是不可能的任務」，因此量很快縮掉，多餘資金追逐熱的標的，「房市馬上要熱起來機率不大」。",

      "Content": "Key Points This ETF has an interesting history as it was born as a software fund.\nNow it resides at the high-growth intersection of AI and software.\nIt doesn’t command the same amount of attention as other AI ETFs, but that anonymity belies opportunity.\n10 stocks we like better than Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF ›\n\nAsking any fund to behave like a story stock, let alone one with an epic tale such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , is a tall order. After all, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of stocks, so even when those products hold shares of a darling like Nvidia, returns are determined by the entire roster, not a single name.\nIt's a trade-off. Investors sacrifice some of the upside potential of an individual stock for the diversification benefits and removal of the stock-picking burden associated with ETFs and index funds . That doesn't mean the ETF landscape is lacking funds with multibagger potential -- not when there are so many dedicated tech and artificial intelligence (AI) ETFs on the market.\nTake the case of the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF (NYSEMKT: IGPT) . This ETF, which counts Nvidia as its second-largest holding, may not be \"the next Nvidia.\" Still, it has the ingredients needed to deliver sizable long-term gains, perhaps even those of the triple-digit variety. Below, I'll examine the bull case for this AI ETF.\n\nThe leopard changed its spots -- AI software matters This Invesco ETF has $652 million in assets under management (AUM) and turned 20 years old in June, so it's neither small, nor young. What's interesting is that this fund was conceived as a software-focused ETF, but amid the AI groundswell, the issuer changed the name and index in June 2023 to better reflect its AI-centric positioning.\n\nBetween 2024 and 2025, Nvidia outpaced the AI ETF by a margin of better than 5-to-1; however, to the fund's credit, it slightly outpaced the Nasdaq-100 over that time frame. Remember that the aim of an ETF isn't to top its best-performing components. Instead, it's to provide a combination of diversification and upside potential. This Invesco ETF, which charges an annual fee of 0.56%, holds 100 stocks across 17 industries.\nToday, this tech ETF allocates more than 43% of its portfolio to semiconductor stocks, while also providing significant exposure to AI hyperscalers . It also retains some of its software roots, which is important because some experts believe specific software names are among the top AI ideas for long-term investors.\n\nA prime example of the AI/software intersection is Adobe , which is a top 10 holding in this ETF. The company behind Illustrator and Photoshop is well-known to many tech investors and is also developing AI-related products. When Adobe delivered fiscal fourth-quarter results in December, CEO Shantanu Narayen highlighted the company's \"growing importance in the global AI ecosystem and the rapid adoption of our AI-driven tools.\"\n\nStory Continues\nAnother company situated at the intersection of AI and software that could drive this tech ETF to significant gains is Snowflake . A standout tech name with the potential to beat more popular stocks in 2026, Snowflake is leveraging AI tools to retain current clients and attract new ones.\nIts AI-powered Cortex platform allows customers to build apps using the data they're already paying Snowflake to store and secure. This confirms it has multiple avenues for expanding relationships with existing clients while garnering new business.\n\nNot Nvidia -- and it doesn't need to be There are times when investors can benefit from a reality check, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Here it is regarding this AI ETF: It probably won't generate Nvidia-like returns. Few assets ever will, but that's not a knock on this fund because it has the potential to deliver performances that will please even the most discerning investors.\n\nThe growth tailwinds are there. Goldman Sachs estimates the market for AI-powered customer service software could expand by 20% to 45% by 2030. The high end of the range implies growth that's more than double the forecast for the broader software industry.\nAgentic AI progress could also benefit this ETF because its software holdings can present clients with fresh innovations that bring workplace productivity enhancements. Additionally, software developers, including some based in this ETF, are working on addressing issues that hinder AI software adoption. As those strides are made, more tailwinds for this fund could emerge.\nAt the end of the day, this AI ETF is unlikely to match Nvidia's long-term return profile. However, that's not all that negative because the fundamental factors are in place for this fund to deliver triple-digit gains over extended holding periods.\n\nShould you buy stock in Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF right now?

The MI440X is a version of an earlier chip that the U.S. plans to use in a supercomputer.\nAMD is one of Nvidia 's strongest rivals but has struggled to have as much success. In October, AMD signed a deal with OpenAI ⁠that, in addition to the financial upside, ‌was a major vote of confidence in AMD's AI chips and software. But it is unlikely to dent Nvidia's dominance, as the market leader continues to sell every AI chip ‍it can make, analysts said.\nAt the Monday event, OpenAI President Greg Brockman joined Su on stage and said chip advancements were critical to OpenAI's vast computing needs.\n\nLooking to the future needs of companies like OpenAI, Su previewed the MI500 and said it offered 1,000 ​times the performance of an older version of the processor. The company said the chips would launch in 2027.\nAt ‌the event, Su hosted Daniele Pucci, CEO of Generative Bionics, an Italian AI developer, who unveiled GENE.01, a humanoid robot.\n\"Our first commercial humanoid robot will be manufactured in the second half of 2026,\" Pucci said at the event.\nEarlier on Monday, Nvidia showed off its next-generation Vera Rubin platform, which is made up of six separate chips.

      "Content": "Samsung begins its CES 2026 Tech Forums by convening leaders in smart home interoperability for an industry-defining discussion\nLAS VEGAS , Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today convened leaders across industries in to discuss the importance of smart home interoperability in the first of its Tech Forum panels at CES 2026 at The Wynn in Las Vegas, Nevada. In the session, titled \"When Everything Clicks: How Open Ecosystems Deliver Impactful AI,\" experts discussed how cross-industry partnerships are transforming connected homes into intelligent environments that feel seamless, safe and genuinely supportive of people's lives.\n\nOpenness as the Foundation of Home AI\nThe panelists agreed that the next era of home intelligence must be built on open collaboration, not closed ecosystems. As homes increasingly rely on devices and services from many brands and industries, openness enables AI systems to work together in ways that create real-world impact. Samsung shared its belief that open connectivity allows appliances, energy systems, safety services and partners across industries to deliver experiences that would be impossible in siloed environments.\n\n\"Home is the most personal place in our lives, so home AI must earn trust — quietly, respectfully, and with value users can feel,\" said Yoonho Choi, President & Chair of the Board of the Home Connectivity Alliance and Head of Strategic Alliances at Samsung Electronics. \"That requires interoperability across brands, so the home works as one system instead of disconnected features. Through cooperation with HCA and across industries, we're turning openness into outcomes: safer homes, simpler routines and measurable savings — built on consent and transparency.\"\nPowering the World's Largest Connected Home Ecosystem\nSamsung highlighted the scale and depth of its connected ecosystem, noting that more than 500 million users are already part of the SmartThings community. With over a decade of leadership in connected living, Samsung brings deep insight into how AI companionship in the home is evolving, from today's smart devices to tomorrow's system-wide intelligence.\n\nThis foundation allows Samsung to design AI experiences that coordinate across appliances and services, delivering value that feels natural rather than technical.\n\"It's crucial to deliver tangible user benefits that make people's lives better,\" said Michael Wolf, founder and editor-in-chief of The Spoon. \"Along these lines, there's no area that will bring more benefit than a broadly connected kitchen — one that that allows users to understand what's in their refrigerator while connecting to the water and heating networks, allowing for a more holistic understanding that takes preventative action.\"\n\nStory Continues\nTurning Collaboration Into Measurable Consumer Benefits\nThe panel also examined how open ecosystems enable measurable benefits for consumers through cross-industry partnerships. Samsung highlighted its collaboration with Hartford Steam Boiler (HSB) as a first-of-its-kind example of how smart home data — used responsibly and transparently — can deliver meaningful outcomes.\n\n\"We're at a point where the connected home can bring seamless integration into user lifestyles, which begins to develop trust in smart home equipment that results in direct benefits to consumers,\" said Jed Usich, Senior Vice President of Strategic Growth Solutions at HSB. \"Through our partnership with Samsung, we've created a bridge to the insurance industry that takes simple datapoints and turns them into tangible savings for consumers.\"\nDesigning AI That Feels Human, Not Intrusive\nThroughout the discussion, the panelists emphasized that for home AI to succeed, it must feel emotionally intelligent and fit naturally into routines including cooking, relaxing, entertaining and caring for families. Design, storytelling and behavioral understanding all play a role in making connected devices feel like calm, reliable companions.\n\nTogether, the panelists agreed that the future of home AI depends on interoperability, responsible data use and collaboration across industries, ensuring intelligent homes deliver real value without compromising trust.\nAs AI becomes more ambient and system-wide, Samsung remains focused on building open ecosystems that make connected living simpler, safer and more meaningful, proving that when everything clicks, home AI can truly improve everyday life.\nAbout Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nSamsung inspires the world and shapes the future with transformative ideas and technologies. The company is redefining the worlds of TVs, digital signage, smartphones, wearables, tablets, home appliances and network systems, as well as memory, system LSI and foundry. Samsung is also advancing medical imaging technologies, HVAC solutions and robotics, while creating innovative automotive and audio products through Harman. With its SmartThings ecosystem, open collaboration with partners, and integration of AI across its portfolio, Samsung delivers a seamless and intelligent connected experience.

      "Content": "MSFT\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL ) is included among the 13 Best January Dividend Stocks to Invest in .\nOn January 5, Melius Research upgraded Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) to Buy from Hold and set a $135 price target. The analyst noted that the stock is down about 11% from its recent intraday high. From their perspective, Marvell’s backlog in custom silicon continues to build. Revenue from this segment is expected to double in calendar year 2027, driven by Microsoft’s MAIA chip and the ramp of several XPU-attach sockets. The analyst also pointed out that Microsoft’s internal silicon design capabilities still lag those of AWS’s Annapurna Labs. That gap could leave room for a larger share of profits to flow to external custom silicon providers such as Marvell Technology.\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) has been benefiting from fast-growing demand for AI-focused application-specific integrated circuits used in data centers. These ASICs are designed to handle AI workloads more efficiently, offering higher speeds and better power efficiency than general-purpose chips like GPUs.\nAs a result, hyperscalers and AI-focused companies are increasingly turning to ASIC designers to build in-house chips. Demand has picked up sharply. According to TrendForce, ASIC shipments are expected to grow 45% in 2026, compared with an estimated 16% increase in GPU shipments. That trend places Marvell in a strong position going into 2026. The company counts major customers such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft among its client base.\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), along with its subsidiaries, supplies data infrastructure semiconductor solutions across the data center core and out to the network edge.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "2025年台股創歷史新紀錄，高低點震盪逾萬點，專家還看好2026年能挑戰三萬四千點？\n\n台積電佔台股大盤權重逾四成，分析師看好台積股價2026年站上兩千元，帶動大盤再攀高峰。群益投顧總經理范振鴻解釋，台積新產能2027年才會放量，獲利成長幅度還會大於2026年，「因此資金長線還會繼續流向台積電。」助攻大盤點位的，還有更加寬鬆的資金環境和AI泡沫疑慮消弭。\n\n聯準會自2022年起每月從市場收回數百億美元資金，做法是央行手中持有的債券到期後，收回本金，不再買新債，達到縮減資產負債表。但新的變化是，聯準會自2025年12月起，把到期債券的本金拿去買短期國債，形同市場資金不再減少。\n\n統一投顧總經理廖婉婷表示，資金最緊的時刻已經過去了，這對股市就是一大利多。市場預期，隨聯準會新任主席獲任命，以及迎接下半年美國期中選舉，2026年會繼續降息，資金環境將更寬鬆。\n\n「AI的成長週期還在中前段，」從事台股研究逾20年、野村投信國內股票投資部主管姚郁如定調，AI泡沫暫時還不會破，科技巨頭的獲利和資產負債表依舊穩健。\n\nAI繼續是台股投資主軸，但投資人要留意，贏家圈正在變小。「投資人不能再用『沾到什麼題材就追』的邏輯，要搞清楚誰還會繼續成長，」范振鴻提醒。因為AI伺服器產品的生命週期愈來愈短，新的GPU推出，供應鏈就會重新洗牌。\n\n所有分析師都認為，輝達與台積電的供應鏈，才是2026年「真贏家」。看好族群包括：先進封裝、電源供應、AI伺服器周邊的關鍵零組件，像BBU（Battery Backup Unit）備援電池、CCL（高階銅箔基板）、以及伺服器用多層數PCB等領域、2奈米量產相關材料。\n\n惟部份2025年漲多的AI概念股，如ASIC（特定應用積體電路）將上檔有限，散熱、記憶體則有股價回檔風險。\n\n記憶體大漲恐怕也無法延續。姚郁如解釋，未來AI需求最大的是HBM（高頻寬記憶體），次之是第五代DRAM（DDR5），但台廠在前者未佈局，後者雖有佈局，但重心仍在第四代（DDR4）。\n\n傳產2026年有望受惠低基期，落後補漲，包括成衣、製鞋、汽車零組件等。\n\n姚郁如分析，這些企業2025年上半在等關稅結果，不敢下單；到了2025年8月關稅出爐，第三季下游品牌才決定「要漲價」還是「跟供應商一起分攤」，訂單才慢慢回流，而這些訂單都是2026年的春夏貨。\n\n美國降息對於有大量美債部位的壽險金控，將因債券評價改善受惠。軍工股看好，但要挑對時機。富邦投顧董事長陳奕光指出，撇開尚未通過的特別預算，2026年國防預算近9500億，其中約1000億採購無人機、無人艦等軍用消耗品，未來會在台灣形成新的供應鏈。但因為第一季才開標，明確的營收獲利成長，要等到第二季或下半年才會顯現。\n\n文：楊湛華 圖片來源：劉鎮豪繪\n\n看更多天下雜誌101大樓空拍照可能是假的，但中共軍演五大警訊是真的85度C大開生甜甜圈店業績翻倍 能挽救7億虧損、復興台灣市場嗎？馬太鞍溢流100天》堤防愈築愈高，洪水卻愈來愈近？留守家園的人，何去何從？巴菲特、比爾蓋茲都遵行 世界最有錢家庭的7個成功習慣6大常見退休陷阱！這些生活習慣，正在悄悄吃掉養老金\n\n※更多精彩報導，詳見《天下雜誌》網站。\n\n※本文由天下雜誌授權報導，未經同意禁止轉載",

      "Content": "NVIDIA創辦人暨執行長黃仁勳點名也沒用？台積電股價新年開盤直衝1,695元新天價，市場才剛見證歷史，但今（6）日漲勢並未延續，股價開低，盤中最低觸及1645元，下跌25元，幅度1.49%。專家建議，漲多震盪屬正常，投資人宜待量能與市場情緒降溫後再分批布局，以降低風險。\n\n黃仁勳在一年一度的 CES 展前主題演講中，大秀全新 Rubin 平台，並透露該平台已全面投產，且採用晶圓代工龍頭台積電（2330）最新的 CoPoS 先進封裝技術。\n\n不過，相關利多未能帶動股價表現，台積電今（6）日股價開低，早盤以 1,645 元開出，下跌 25元，跌幅 1.49%。\n\n國泰證期顧問處協理蔡明翰指出，台積電股價在創高後出現震盪整理，其實屬於合理走勢。他分析，首先，台積電前一交易日股價大漲，但外資買盤並未明顯擴大，顯示追價動能有限；其次，近期股價快速上揚，技術面乖離率已超過一成，短線本就容易出現拉回或整理。\n\n此外，蔡明翰也提醒，隨著台積電法說會將近，市場態度轉趨觀望，在重要財報與展望公布前，股價震盪屬於常見現象，「若股價一路上衝，反而更容易讓市場擔心利多提前反映、出現利多出盡的風險。」\n\n蔡明翰進一步建議投資人短線不宜追高，可觀察成交量是否逐步降溫，待市場情緒回歸理性、月均量趨於穩定後，再評估分批進場，整體風險相對較為可控。\n\n台積電ADR(美股代碼TSM)於周一(1月5日)延續強勢破頂走勢。繼上日大漲5.17%後，週一盤中一度追高11.64美元或3.64%，衝上331.25美元的日高暨史上新高。\n\n儘管尾盤漲幅縮小，終場只收高0.83%，來到322.25美元，仍連續兩個交易日改寫收盤新高。\n\n隨著台積電ADR股價連兩日破頂，將台積電ADR市值推升至1兆6714億美元，成功超越博通(Broadcom)的1兆6282億美元，躍升為全球第七大科技企業。\n\n僅次於輝達(Nvidia)、蘋果(Apple)、Alphabet(Google母公司)、微軟(Microsoft)、亞馬遜(Amazon)與Meta。",

      "Content": "輝達（NVIDIA）執行長黃仁勳於CES 2026發表主題演說，以台北101影像作為開場鋪陳，象徵AI產業正邁入全新階段。黃仁勳直言，全球運算架構已站上歷史轉折點，過去數十年以CPU與傳統軟體為核心的產業邏輯，正在被AI全面重寫。\n\n根據《工商時報》6日報導指出，黃仁勳表示，第一個結構性改變，是應用程式本身的本質正在轉變。傳統軟體仰賴工程師預先撰寫與編譯，如今則逐步由模型即時生成內容，從影像畫面到語言token，幾乎每一個細節都由AI動態產生。他形容，AI不再只是工具，而是承載未來所有應用的基礎平台，全球既有IT系統勢必全面翻新，龐大的研發與資本支出也正快速向AI集中。\n\n第二個關鍵變革，則是運算核心的世代交替。黃仁勳強調，產業已正式走出CPU主導時代，GPU與各類加速運算正成為主流。隨著模型規模與推論需求呈指數成長，傳統架構已難以負荷，運算堆疊必須從底層重新設計，才能支撐下一階段的AI發展。\n\n報導稱，談到AI的演進方向，黃仁勳歸納三大突破路徑，包括具備更強邏輯能力的推理型模型、可自主執行任務的代理式AI，以及他反覆強調的「實體AI」。他指出，真正的關鍵不在於AI是否能生成內容，而在於是否能理解物理世界的因果關係，並在真實環境中做出正確行動；這將決定AI能否從數位空間走向現實世界。\n\n在自動駕駛領域，輝達同步揭示全新端到端自駕AI架構。黃仁勳指出，新系統不只負責感知環境，更具備推理與決策能力，能從攝影機輸入一路整合到轉向、煞車與加速控制，並在每次動作前清楚說明行為邏輯。他表示，透過大量人類駕駛示範資料，搭配由世界模型生成的合成場景，自駕系統可在虛擬環境中累積近乎無限的行駛經驗，進而克服過去難以處理的極端情境。\n\n機器人發展同樣被視為實體AI的重要落腳點。黃仁勳指出，真正可用的機器人，必須同時具備訓練、推論與模擬三種運算能力。輝達透過高度擬真的數位分身與模擬環境，讓機器人在虛擬世界中反覆學習與測試，再將成果快速導入現實場域，藉此縮短從研發到商用的時間差。\n\n該份報導也提到，在平台層面，黃仁勳也宣布新一代Vera Rubin系統正式進入量產階段。他坦言，面對模型規模與推論強度同步暴增，僅靠製程微縮已無法延續效能曲線，輝達因此選擇從CPU、GPU、互連、網路到DPU全面重新設計，採取極限協同設計，將效能與效率直接內嵌於硬體之中。\n\n黃仁勳指出，Vera Rubin並非單一晶片升級，而是一整套運算平台。新一代GPU在電晶體增幅有限的情況下，仍能大幅拉開推論與訓練效能差距，關鍵在於硬體層即完成精度與效率的動態調整；系統層則透過高速互連與新型網路架構，解決生成式AI長上下文與資料流量瓶頸問題。\n\n黃仁勳同時也點名，台積電為Vera Rubin幕後關鍵推手之一，輝達與台積電從先進製程、先進封裝一路延伸至光電整合，展開深度協同設計，並透過COUPE技術，將矽光子技術直接導入交換晶片，打造具備512埠、單埠200Gbps傳輸能力的Spectrum-X光電乙太網路晶片。黃仁勳直言，唯有跨晶片、跨系統的整體設計，才能在摩爾定律趨緩的情況下，持續推動運算效能前進。\n\n黃仁勳最後定調，輝達下一階段的核心目標，已不只是推動生成式AI，而是打造能理解世界、並在現實中行動的實體AI。隨著自駕車與機器人逐步成熟，AI產業的競爭，正從單點效能之爭，升級為平台與生態系的長期戰局。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導美元又輸了？「銅礦大國」為何接受人民幣繳稅 外媒揭北京逆襲再下一城台灣「富豪」多有錢？金管會數據驚人 光是財管就破2兆AI泡沫疑慮 專家揭「四級崩盤預警」！點名這2家風險最高",

      "Content": "At CES 2026, Qualcomm Technologies introduced a next-generation, full-stack robotics architecture built around its new Dragonwing IQ10 Series processor for industrial autonomous mobile robots and advanced humanoids, integrating hardware, software, and compound AI.\nThe launch underscores Qualcomm’s push to extend its edge AI capabilities beyond smartphones into “physical AI” systems, supported by partnerships with firms such as Kuka Robotics, Figure, and VinMotion to move prototypes toward large-scale deployment.\nWe’ll now examine how Qualcomm’s Dragonwing IQ10 robotics platform shapes its broader investment narrative around AI-enabled devices and diversified end markets.\n\nThese 14 companies survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs . Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch.\nQUALCOMM Investment Narrative Recap To own Qualcomm, you need to believe its core handset and licensing engine can fund a transition into broader AI-enabled devices, from PCs to cars and now robots. The Dragonwing IQ10 robotics launch adds to that diversification story but does not meaningfully change the near term focus on upcoming earnings and handset demand, or the key risk from rising in-house chip efforts at major OEMs and intensifying competition in China.\n\nAmong recent announcements, Qualcomm’s deeper push into Windows PCs with the Snapdragon X2 Plus at CES sits closest to this “beyond smartphones” narrative, alongside Dragonwing. Both product lines are tied to the same catalyst: broader adoption of AI-capable edge devices that could gradually reduce Qualcomm’s reliance on smartphones, while still leaving it exposed to execution risk in newer markets such as PCs, automotive, and industrial IoT.\nBut investors should also be aware that escalating in-house chip development by large OEMs could...\nRead the full narrative on QUALCOMM (it's free!)\nQUALCOMM's narrative projects $46.9 billion revenue and $12.2 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 2.7% yearly revenue growth and about a $0.6 billion earnings increase from $11.6 billion today.\n\nUncover how QUALCOMM's forecasts yield a $191.80 fair value , a 11% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Twenty six fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span about US$159 to US$300 per share, with sizeable clusters above US$230. Readers should weigh this spread against Qualcomm’s reliance on AI-enabled device adoption as a key long term growth driver, and consider how differently that catalyst could play out across individual forecasts.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 26 other fair value estimates on QUALCOMM - why the stock might be worth 8% less than the current price!\nBuild Your Own QUALCOMM Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "AMD\n\nInvesting.com -- NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is accelerating its release cycle, announcing at the CES 2026 convention on Monday that its highly anticipated Rubin data center products are in full production and nearing release this year. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang used his keynote presentation in Las Vegas to signal that Nvidia is maintaining its lead in the aggressive race to supply the infrastructure for artificial intelligence.\n\nAll six chips in the Rubin platform are back from manufacturing partners and have passed initial milestone tests, putting them on track for customer deployment in the second half of 2026. The move to detail these products at CES underscores a push to keep the industry tethered to Nvidia hardware as competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and in-house silicon efforts from cloud providers intensifies.\nFaster Training, Cheaper Inference\n\nThe Rubin accelerator is designed to address the massive compute requirements of agentic AI models that solve problems through multistage reasoning rather than simple pattern recognition. According to the company, the Rubin GPU is:\n3.5 times better at training AI models than the current Blackwell architecture.\n5 times better at running (inference) AI software.\n\nThe platform includes a new Vera CPU featuring 88 custom cores, which provides twice the performance of the component it replaces. Nvidia emphasized that Rubin-based systems will be more cost-effective for operators, returning the same results as Blackwell while using significantly fewer components and up to 10x lower cost per token.\nExpanding the AI Factory\n\nNvidia is positioning the Rubin platform as a modular \"supercomputer in a box.\" The hardware includes the BlueField-4 DPU, which acts as an AI-native storage processor. By managing \"context memory,\" the chip allows AI agents to retain long-term information without bottlenecking the main processors, a move that boosts power efficiency by 5x.\n\nEarly adopters of the Vera Rubin NVL72 rack systems include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which plans to integrate them into its Fairwater AI superfactories, alongside Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Cloud Infrastructure.\nThe ’ChatGPT Moment’ for Robotics, ’Inflection Point’ for AV\nBeyond the data center, Huang characterized the current era as the \"ChatGPT moment\" for physical AI, and an ’inflection point’ for autonomous vehicles. To broaden adoption across the economy, Nvidia unveiled:\n\nStory Continues\nAlpamayo: A family of open AI models designed to help autonomous vehicles reason through rare \"long-tail\" driving scenarios. Nvidia plans to test a Level 4 robotaxi service with a partner as soon as 2027.\nJetson T4000: A new robotics module based on the Blackwell architecture, delivering 4x the energy efficiency for humanoid robots and industrial automation.\n\nWhile some on Wall Street remain wary of the sustainability of massive AI capital expenditures, Nvidia’s early reveal of Rubin suggests the company is betting that the shift toward reasoning-based AI will require a total market infrastructure upgrade measured in the trillions of dollars.\nRelated articles\nNvidia accelerates AI roadmap: Rubin superchip in full production, 5x faster\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now",

      "Content": "輝達（NVIDIA）執行長黃仁勳在CES特別演講中，正式揭示新一代 Vera Rubin 平台已進入全面量產階段，並完整說明此世代背後的系統級變革。黃仁勳直言，面對模型規模、推論 token 與訓練強度呈指數級暴增，單靠製程微縮已無法支撐效能曲線，「這一代我們別無選擇，只能重新設計六大關鍵晶片，以極限co-design 同步推進整個運算堆疊。」\n\n黃仁勳指出，Vera Rubin 並非單一 GPU 升級，而是一套橫跨 CPU、GPU、互連、網路、DPU 與交換晶片的整體平台。核心包括全新 Vera CPU 與 Rubin GPU，前者以 88 核心、176 執行緒的空間多執行緒設計，強化單執行緒與 I/O 能力；後者在僅約 1.6 倍電晶體成長下，卻實現 5 倍推論、3.5 倍訓練 的峰值效能躍升，關鍵在於 NVFP4 Tensor Core 等硬體級精度動態調整，將以往難以軟體化的運算效率直接內嵌於晶片之中。\n\n在系統層，Vera Rubin 採用 NVLink 72 與新一代 Spectrum-X AI 乙太網路，並結合 BlueField-4 DPU，將 east-west 與 north-south 流量分流處理；同時單顆 GPU 可擴展至額外16 TB，直指生成式 AI 長上下文與測試時擴展（test-time scaling）的瓶頸。黃仁勳形容，這不僅是效能競賽，更是資料中心投資回報率的分水嶺。\n\n值得注意的是，Vera Rubin 在散熱與能效上同樣翻轉既有想像。平台全面液冷，無需冷卻機組，即便整體功耗倍增，氣流與水溫條件卻與前代相當，估算可為全球資料中心節省約 6% 用電。同時，全系統匯流排（PCIe、NVLink、CPU-GPU）皆支援全程加密，滿足企業級機密運算需求。\n\n黃仁勳點名，台積電為 Vera Rubin 幕後關鍵推手之一。輝達與台積電在製程、封裝到光電整合展開深度 co-design，並以其 COUPE 技術，將矽光子（Silicon Photonics）直接整合至交換晶片，打造 512 埠、200Gbps 的 Spectrum-X 光電乙太網路晶片。黃仁勳強調，這類跨晶片、跨系統的協同設計，是突破摩爾定律放緩的唯一道路。\n\n在時程上，黃仁勳明確表示，繼 GB200/GB300之後，Vera Rubin 已於今年進入量產，可即時銜接雲端與 AI 工廠部署。他以天文學家 Vera Rubin 發現暗物質的典故比喻，稱新平台正是為了解決 AI 時代「看不見、卻決定一切的運算需求」而生。\n\n法人解讀，Vera Rubin 的全面量產，不僅鞏固輝達在 AI 訓練與推論的技術門檻，也再次凸顯台積電在先進製程、先進封裝與異質整合上的不可替代性。隨著極限 co-design 成為新常態，AI 晶片競賽已從單點效能，全面升級為「平台與供應鏈」的長期戰。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導南亞科已不便宜！PCB女王喊快下車 記憶體看好「這2檔」原因曝 輝達買Croq：對台積電是大利多財經選讀》陸33歲小鎮青年為何讓Meta豪砸627億 拒絕字節跳動、投奔美國有底氣目標價1表看》不是仁寶、緯創…法人喊買7檔老AI 「這檔」明年營收增4成：竟還有100元上漲空間",

      "Content": "【財訊快報／方亞申】台積電ADR及費半設備族群上週五大漲，推動台股週一直接開高，台積電(2330)一馬當先頻改寫歷史新高，由於總市值已成全球第六大公司，拉抬後非同凡響，指數一度上漲近1000點，第二、第三及第四大權值股小漲，加上記憶體、特用化學、設備、封測等半導體助攻，金融股盤堅，指數終場大漲755.23點或2.57%，收在30,105.04點，成交量驚爆次天量7,669.32億元。不過中小型股卻是開高走低收黑，顯見現階段以大型股為主。在晶片類股輝達和英特爾帶動下，2026年第一個交易日美股開紅盤，費半指數氣勢如虹，台積電ADR勁揚逾5%，市值升抵1.66兆美元，一舉躍居全球市值第六大企業。設備股艾司摩爾、科磊、應材等都上漲，當然記憶體美光大漲10%、SNDK上漲15%，市值王輝達小漲，使得半導體一枝獨秀。1月美國財經大事不斷，首週先是迎來就業報告和CES大會，接下來有通膨數據和第四季財報季登場，市場期待的聯準會（Fed）新任主席和關稅案裁決即將揭曉，預料將牽動新的一年美股走勢。這其中元月開始美國企業要開始公布財報，以去年第三季美國估季成長率高達3%以上，通膨壓力也下降，美股現階段只要未跌破月線都是偏多。歐洲股市盤堅，亞洲股市韓股漲勢驚人，三星去年大漲後，今年已上漲超過14%，海力士也上漲，推升韓股指數頗有向5,000點推升企圖。日本軍工股大漲，指數經過日、中關係惡化後再度站穩5萬點。科技業年度盛事－美國消費電子展（CES）6日在拉斯維加斯揭幕，黃仁勳將率先發表演說，將揭示AI技術下一步方向。而台股上週五新的一年已出現外資回頭買超，配合台積電ADR創高，週一台積電少見一度上漲超過百元，帶動台股不僅突破三萬點，甚至指數一度逼近上漲1,000點，重量級權值股一到十名全部上漲，台積電15日法說會前利多應該不斷，包括產能爆滿及漲價題材。由於日韓同樣漲半導體及設備，台股就不會太顯突出，人氣記憶體股威剛(3260)、十銓(4967)、群聯(8299)被迫公布獲利都很好，股價被關禁閉轉為盤堅，華邦電(2344)、鈺創(5351)、晶豪科(3006)、旺宏(2337)、愛普*(6531)、力積電(6770)繼之而起，整體族群續強。封測則有力成(6239)、日月光投控(3711)、華東(8110)強勢，走勢有點分歧。AI供應鏈漲跌互見，台達電(2308)、光寶科(2301)、貿聯-KY(3665)、台光電(2383)、智邦(2345)、高力(8996)表現較強；矽智財聯發科(2454)、創意(3443)、世芯-KY(3661)表現強勢。設備及特化族群則有勝一(1773)、晶呈科技(4768)、三福化(4755)、台特化(4772)、新應材(4749)、雙鍵(4764)、德淵(4720)走強。耗材的中砂(1560)、昇陽半導體(8028)股價創高，跟2奈米緊俏有關。金融股國泰金(2882)、富邦金(2881)、凱基金(2883)、第一金(2892)、華南金(2880)上漲，使得指數能大漲755點創新高並站上3萬點，短線5日線不破指數續漲，但出現次天量7,669億元，僅次於2012年5月12日當時指數15,902點天量的7,828億元，量價齊揚，但不宜連續大量及融資大增。",

So this is Nvidia's new super chip.\n00:04 Speaker A\nJensen Wong saying now it's in full production. So this is one of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its its Ruben platform. What is your technical take there Austin? and we we turned to you of course because, listen, you were a former hardware engineered Intel, you got the chops to to weigh in here.\n00:29 Austin\nYeah, this is everything we expect from Nvidia. Uh 10x higher throughput, 1/10th the token cost.\n00:39 Austin\nand that's from innovating at the system level. So not just the GPU but the GPU, the networking and we even saw some innovations around memory storage. So, I think this is exactly what everyone expected from these technology leaders in Nvidia.\n00:58 Speaker A\nI want to get bring Paul in here too. But Austin, just quickly, another technical question I had as I was listening there. These Rubin-based systems, Austin, that that Jensen is talking about, how are they different? How do they compare and contrast Austin? Can you put it simply for me to to their previous versions to Blackwell? Is it is it about performance Austin? Is it cheaper to run? How do they compare and contrast?\n01:25 Austin\nYeah, so there's more compute power, but the system is optimized via software. Um even using these DPUs, these network processors at the system level to take an LLM and run it at much higher throughput and much lower cost. So it's it's it's similar to to Blackwell, similar to Hopper. It's the next generation but just improved. It's kind of more of everything, more compute, um better networking and more system optimization specifically around LLMs.",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-nadella-wants-us-stop-230956814.html",
      "Content": "ANTH.PVT\n\nAMZN\n\nCRM\n\nA couple of weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” as its word of the year , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella weighed in on what to expect from AI in 2026.\nIn his classic, intellectual style, Nadella wrote on his personal blog that he wants us to stop thinking of AI as “slop” and start thinking of it as “bicycles for the mind.”\n\nHe wrote, “A new concept that evolves ‘bicycles for the mind’ such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute.”\nHe continued: “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”\nIf you parse through those syllables, you may see that he’s not only urging everyone to stop thinking of AI-generated content as slop, but also wants the tech industry to stop talking about AI as a replacement for humans . He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead.\nHere’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of replacing human labor as a way to price it, and justify its expense.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs , raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in an interview on 60 Minutes .\nYet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind checking the AI’s work for accuracy ).\nOne oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg , which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor.\n\nWhile this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is how much of a job can be offloaded to AI . It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the tasks it cites as examples include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code.\nThat’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called Blood in the Machine . Then there are the high unemployment rates among new grad junior coders .\n\nStory Continues\nBut it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet.\nSo it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nThe Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable.\nThe irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off over 15,000 people in 2025 , even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its last fiscal year, which closed in June — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a public memo about the layoffs after these results.\nNotably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he did say that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality).\n\nThe truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 AI is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones.\nTo be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, CNBC reported. That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft and other tech companies chasing AI.\nAnd to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses , too.",

AI-native applications require a new kind of scalable infrastructure to store and share this data.\nNVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform provides the infrastructure for context memory by extending GPU memory capacity, enabling high-speed sharing across nodes, boosting tokens per seconds by up to 5x and delivering up to 5x greater power efficiency compared with traditional storage.\n\n“AI is revolutionizing the entire computing stack — and now, storage,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “AI is no longer about one-shot chatbots but intelligent collaborators that understand the physical world, reason over long horizons, stay grounded in facts, use tools to do real work, and retain both short- and long-term memory. With BlueField-4, NVIDIA and our software and hardware partners are reinventing the storage stack for the next frontier of AI.”\nNVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform boosts KV cache capacity and accelerates the sharing of context across clusters of rack-scale AI systems, while persistent context for multi-turn AI agents improves responsiveness, increases AI factory throughput and supports efficient scaling of long-context, multi-agent inference.\n\nStory Continues\nKey capabilities of the NVIDIA BlueField-4-powered platform include:\nNVIDIA Rubin cluster-level KV cache capacity, delivering the scale and efficiency required for long-context, multi-turn agentic inference.\nUp to 5x greater power efficiency than traditional storage.\nSmart, accelerated sharing of KV cache across AI nodes, enabled by the NVIDIA DOCA™ framework and tightly integrated with the NVIDIA NIXL library and NVIDIA Dynamo software to maximize tokens per second, reduce time to first token and improve multi-turn responsiveness.\nHardware-accelerated KV cache placement managed by NVIDIA BlueField-4 eliminates metadata overhead, reduces data movement and ensures secure, isolated access from the GPU nodes.\nEfficient data sharing and retrieval enabled by NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet serves as the high-performance network fabric for RDMA-based access to AI-native KV cache.\n\nStorage innovators including AIC, Cloudian, DDN , Dell Technologies, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, Nutanix , Pure Storage, Supermicro, VAST Data and WEKA are among the first building next-generation AI storage platforms with BlueField-4, which will be available in the second half of 2026.\nLearn more by watching NVIDIA Live at CES .\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in AI and accelerated computing.\nFor further information, contact:\nAlex Shapiro\nCorporate Communications\nNVIDIA Corporation\n1-415-608-5044\nashapiro@nvidia.com\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: AI revolutionizing the entire computing stack and storage; AI no longer about one-shot chatbots but intelligent collaborators that understand the physical world, reason over long horizons, stay grounded in facts, use tools to do real work, and retain both short- and long-term memory; with BlueField-4, NVIDIA and its software and hardware partners reinventing the storage stack for the next frontier of AI; the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of NVIDIA’s products, services, and technologies; expectations with respect to NVIDIA’s third party arrangements, including with its collaborators and partners; expectations with respect to technology developments; and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\nNvidia said companies including Lucid ( LCID ), Uber ( UBER ), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Today at the Consumer Electronics show, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang officially launched the company’s new Rubin computing architecture, which he described as the state of the art in AI hardware. The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year.\n\n“Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang told the audience. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.”\nThe Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024 , is the latest result of Nvidia’s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.\n\nRubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic , OpenAI , and Amazon Web Services . Rubin systems will also be used in HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.\n\nNamed for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin , the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.\nExplaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems.\n“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs . “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”\n\nAs expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.\nRubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.",

      "Content": "Amazon has purchased the land it plans to use for a distribution center in Eugene.\nAmazon.com Services LLC paid $2 million on Dec. 26 for the lot on Highway 99 where the company intends to build a large e-commerce center. The sale was first reported by Eugene Weekly and confirmed by the Register-Guard, which also obtained a copy of the deed.\n\nAmazon plans to develop offices, an employee training center, a warehouse, a distribution facility and fleet storage with 370 parking spaces on the 84-acre lot bordering Highway 99, the airport and Awbrey Lane.\nHow will Amazon's plan affect traffic? According to an application submitted to the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency, the distribution center will add 2,592 trips per day to Highway 99. The city of Eugene's website states the developers estimate that fewer than 100 of the daily trips will occur between 7 and 8 a.m. and 4 and 5 p.m.\nWhat about the wetlands? Amazon's proposal will permanently alter 6.75 acres of wetlands through infill and removal of soil. Developers have proposed to mitigate this by purchasing Amazon Prairie wetland mitigation credits from the city of Eugene. Public comment closed Jan 2. and was being reviewed by the Oregon Department of State Lands, which is scheduled to give a response to the application by March 2.\n\nWhat types of delivery vehicles will Amazon use? As a condition of the LRAPA permit, Amazon committed to using 25% electric vehicles in Year 1, 40% in Year 5 and 70% in Year 10.\nHow big will the Amazon warehouse be? Several permit applications have indicated the facility will be 318,000 square feet. Compared to one of Eugene's largest industrial campuses, the defunct Hynix chip factory which covers 1.2 million square feet, the Amazon development is a fraction of the size. And it is dwarfed by Amazon's Woodburn facility, which opened late last year and is billed as the largest building in Oregon at 3.5 million square feet.\nAlan Torres covers local government for the Register-Guard.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), as well as two micro-cap stocks Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp. (ESP) and NeurAxis, Inc. (NRXS). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> Looking Ahead to a New \"Jobs Week\"\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\nMeta&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+3.6% vs. +1.1%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.54 billion people daily. Meta Platforms&rsquo; growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>> )\n\nShares of Bank of America have gained +16.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry&rsquo;s gain of +17.3%. The company's net interest income (NII) will likely be aided by decent loan growth, despite rate cuts. The Zacks analyst expects NII to see a CAGR of 5.7% by 2027.\n\nPlans to open financial centers in new and existing markets, and improve digital capabilities will support the top line. We project total revenues to grow 6.9% in 2025. Yet the volatile nature of the capital markets makes growth in trading revenues uncertain. Despite a robust trading performance since 2022, growth may normalize going forward.\n\nWhile we expect sales and trading revenues to increase in 2025, the metric will likely decline in 2026. Elevated expenses due to steady investments in its franchise will likely hurt bottom-line growth. The Zacks analyst expects expenses to rise 4.3% in 2025. Weak asset quality is another obstacle.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>> )\n\nProcter & Gamble&rsquo;s shares have declined -10.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry&rsquo;s decline of -11%. The company&rsquo;s strong portfolio, innovations, and productivity efforts reinforce its ability to deliver sustainable growth. Earnings and sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year in Q1 fiscal 2026.\n\nPG expects 1&ndash;5% all-in sales growth and flat to up 4% organic sales gains in fiscal 2026, supported by cost savings. We expect organic sales to rise 2% in fiscal 2026. Robust cash flow funds dividends and share buybacks, with $15 billion planned shareholder returns in fiscal 2026.\n\nPG&rsquo;s consistent execution positions it well to balance growth, resilience, and shareholder value creation. However, elevated commodity costs, tariff pressures, higher interest expenses, and macroeconomic woes continue to weigh on margins and earnings visibility.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>> )\n\nShares of Espey Mfg. & Electronics have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Military industry over the past six months (+3.5% vs. -32.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $137.63 million record $141.1 million backlog, with 72% scheduled through 2028+, ensures revenue visibility despite a 12.9% Q1 FY26 sales decline.\n\nGross margin expanded to 35.4%, highlighting strong cost control and product mix advantages. Espey&rsquo;s core capabilities in rugged power electronics align with growing defense electronics demand amid global modernization trends. A clean balance sheet and consistent dividends, including a $1.00/share payout (4X prior year), underscore financial discipline and cash generation strength.\n\nRisks include high customer concentration (top 5 = 80% of sales), increased inventories (+18% YoY), and lower order intake relative to FY25. Inflationary pressure and reimbursement-dependent capex introduce near-term volatility.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Espey Mfg. & Electronics here >>> )\n\nNeurAxis&rsquo; shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry over the past six months (+65.2% vs. -16.2%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $47.51 million targets a large, underserved gut/brain disorder market with its FDA-cleared IB-Stim neuromodulation system, recently expanded to treat functional dyspepsia (FD), doubling its pediatric addressable market to $8 billion.\n\nNeurAxis&rsquo; non-invasive, drug-free profile, guideline inclusion and growing evidence support differentiation. Rapid reimbursement expansion and a permanent CPT Category I code effective January 2026 should improve provider economics and accelerate uptake. Revenue has grown at double-digit rates, but losses persist amid high spending, margin pressure and reliance on external capital.\n\nThe adult RED diagnostic adds diversification but remains early with execution risk. CPT implementation could unlock a revenue inflection in mid-to-late 2026, but near-term adoption frictions and liquidity pressure may temper upside. Valuation implies high expectations.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NeurAxis here >>> )\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Carvana Co. (CVNA), Jabil Inc. (JBL) and NVR, Inc. (NVR).\n\nMark Vickery\nSenior Editor\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

      "Content": "TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n086280.KS\n\nLAS VEGAS — Hyundai is joining the global push into robotics, announcing at CES 2026 that it plans to set up a manufacturing system capable of producing thousands of robots per year by 2028.\nAtlas is among the most advanced humanoid robots in the world. You've likely seen videos online of the bot doing everything from maneuvering obstacle courses to picking up heavy boxes.\n\nHyundai, which acquired a majority stake in Boston Dynamics in a 2021 deal that valued the company at $1.1 billion, said it will deploy Atlas in its facilities in 2028. The bot will focus on parts sequencing — ensuring vehicle parts are placed in the correct areas of a plant when they're needed.\nThe company said that by 2030 it will begin using Atlas for more complex tasks, including component assembly, and eventually for jobs that involve repetitive motions or require heavy lifting and other tasks.\nOn the manufacturing front, Hyundai said it will leverage its Hyundai Mobis auto parts arm and Hyundai Glovis logistics firm to develop an end-to-end robotics value chain that will allow it to produce some 30,000 robots a year.\nPart of the plan calls for Hyundai to expand its robotics as a service (RaaS) model, in which customers pay for subscription plans to use the Hyundai's robots, to more companies.\nHyundai isn't the only company looking to dominate the robotics space. Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk is keen on making the automaker's Optimus robots the go-to humanoid robots for businesses around the world.\nFigure is developing humanoid robots for labor-intensive settings, the home, and outer space. Apptronik has its own Apollo humanoid bot, while Agility Robotics' Digit is already being used in some Amazon ( AMZN ) warehouses.\n\n1X Technologies is already offering its Neo home robot via a $499 per month subscription or $20,000 to own it outright.\nChina's Unitree, meanwhile, sells its humanoid robot G1 for $13,500 and its more advanced H1 for $90,000 .\nCompanies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), which has partnered with Hyundai, are also looking to physical AI and humanoid robotics as the next major breakthrough areas for their processing capabilities.\nManufacturing, logistics, and shipping firms have been using various robots for years, but humanoid bots are still a relatively new frontier. The idea is that humanoid robots will be able to slide into roles that are too dangerous or tedious for humans without requiring large-scale changes to things like factory floors.\nSimilarly, humanoid robots could prove helpful in hospital and care facilities.\nBut so far, home robots have been largely limited to things like robot vacuums. Amazon has its own non-humanoid Astro home robot that serves as a kind of rolling security guard, and Samsung is working on its Ballie robot .\n\nStory Continues\nIt also remains to be seen whether consumers will be comfortable sharing their living spaces with robots that are roughly the same size as them.\nThat said, at the rate the tech is advancing, we could find out sooner rather than later.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The company's share price was flat as of 3:20 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.6%. Intel stock had been up as much as 6.9% earlier in the day's trading.\nIntel stock initially posted big gains on geopolitical news Over the weekend, U.S. military forces carried out an operation to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power. While that may not seem particularly significant for Intel stock, it's a development that could have significant implications for the company's foundry business.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing currently dominates the chip foundry market, but some investors and analysts are concerned that a potential move by China to exercise greater control over Taiwan could destabilize the industry leader's business. Intel is trying to position itself as a U.S.-based alternative to TSMC, and its stock saw strong bullish momentum early in today's trading before investors reassessed their read on what recent developments in Venezuela could mean for broader geopolitical dynamics.\n\nWhat's next for Intel? Intel is a business that remains squarely in turnaround mode. On the design side, the company has been losing market share when it comes to central processing units ( CPUs ) for PCs and servers. Meanwhile, there's little indication that the company's foundry business has been securing big contract wins for its latest process nodes.\n\nThis year looks poised to be a very important one for Intel. If the company's foundry business can win big contracts for artificial intelligence ( AI ) chips, its stock could see dramatic gains -- but it remains to be seen if the manufacturing unit will deliver.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first ⁠products with the 18A manufacturing process ‌in 2025, referring to the Panther Lake chips.\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is ‍making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips ​to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ‌would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ⁠EST on Monday (0230 GMT on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su ​will likely launch new generations of PC chips that are ​geared for AI and graphics.\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation MI400 chips, some of which the companies plan to deploy this year. The deal ‍with the ChatGPT maker ⁠is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the chip designer.\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia , Jensen Huang, also spoke at CES on Monday. He said ⁠the company’s next generation of chips was in “full production,” and they could deliver five times the artificial-intelligence computing of the ‌company’s previous chips when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n(Reporting by Max A. ‌Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\nFor its part, AMD plans to give a CES ⁠keynote address at 9:30 p.m. EST (0230 GMT ​on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su will likely launch ​new generations of PC chips that are geared for AI and graphics.\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation ‍MI400 chips, some ⁠of which the companies plan to deploy this year. The deal with the ChatGPT maker is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars ⁠in revenue for the chip designer.\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia , Jensen Huang, will ‌also speak at CES on Monday.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Intel stock in focus: recent performance snapshot Intel (INTC) is back on many investors’ watchlists after a mixed set of recent returns, with the share price showing a 6.7% move over the past day and 7.4% over the past week.\nSee our latest analysis for Intel.\nThat sharp 6.7% 1 day share price return and 7.4% 7 day share price return sit against a 1 year total shareholder return of 98.2% and a 5 year total shareholder return of a 15.5% decline, suggesting strong recent momentum after a tougher longer stretch.\n\nIf Intel’s swing has you looking beyond a single name, this could be a good moment to scan other chipmakers and platform players through high growth tech and AI stocks .\nSo with Intel shares up sharply in the past year, annual revenue of US$53.4b and net income of US$198m, is the current price still leaving room for upside or is the market already pricing in future growth?\nMost Popular Narrative: 3.3% Overvalued Intel's most followed narrative points to a fair value of about US$38.14 per share, slightly below the last close of US$39.38. This frames the recent rally in a tighter valuation band.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how relatively modest revenue assumptions, shifting profit margins and a future earnings multiple come together to support a higher fair value than that consensus target? The most popular narrative spells out the growth path, the margin reset and the rating the market would need to accept. The full story is in how those moving parts interact over several years, not just in one headline number.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $38.14 (OVERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this hinges on Intel simplifying its structure and tightening execution, and slower AI adoption or manufacturing setbacks could quickly challenge the case for overvaluation.\nFind out about the key risks to this Intel narrative.\nAnother View: Market Pricing Versus Cash Flows The popular narrative says Intel is about 3.3% overvalued at US$39.38 versus a fair value of roughly US$38.14. Our DCF model paints a sharper contrast, with an estimate of US$14.33, implying the shares are trading well above that cash flow based view.

      "Content": "Last year was not a particularly pleasant year for Tesla (TSLA) stock, with the shares turning red at one point and briefly ranking as the worst performer in the “Magnificent Seven.” There has also been the challenge of falling deliveries and the real prospect of a second straight year of volume decline. Mounting doubts about demand have grown as Tesla cedes market share in key regions.\n\nEurope has been especially tough, with November registrations sliding in major markets like France and Sweden despite a refreshed Model Y lineup. Intensifying competition and an aging model range have weighed heavily on sales.\nMore News from Barchart How Did the 3 Kings of Commodities React to Weekend Developments?\nWhy ConocoPhillips Is One of the Top Oil Stocks to Buy After Venezuela\nChevron, ConocoPhillips, and Gold: Your Critical Watchlist After the U.S.–Venezuela Oil Market Shock\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nHowever, the debate over what comes next is only getting louder and more polarized. Baird has reiterated its bullish stance on Tesla and attached a $548 price target heading into 2026, effectively arguing that 2025’s reset is a setup for a stronger payoff rather than the start of a long fade.\nSo after such a bruising year, is Tesla really setting up for a 2026 comeback, or is the optimism still running ahead of reality? Let's dive in.\nTesla’s 2025 Numbers Still Look Like a “Core Holding” Tesla, headquartered in Austin, Texas, with a market cap of nearly $1.53 trillion, designs and manufactures electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and related software.\nTSLA stock closed around $454.43 on Dec. 30, up about 12.53% year-to-date (YTD) and currently sits about 11% up over the past 52 weeks.\nIts valuation implies a trailing P/E of roughly 327.72x versus a sector median near 16.41x and a P/S of 16.18x versus a sector median of around 0.97x, signaling that investors are still willing to pay a hefty premium.​\nIt reported its most recent quarterly EPS of $0.50 on Oct. 22. Their sales stood at about $28.1 billion for that period, with revenue growth of roughly 24.89%, showing that top‑line momentum remains solid even after a more challenging year.\n\nIts net income figure of roughly $1.37 billion, growing about 17.15%, indicates that profitability is still moving in the right direction, even as pricing and competitive pressures have intensified.\nThe operating cash flow of approximately $10.93 billion, up about 132.84%, highlights how much more cash the business is now generating from its core operations versus a year ago. That strength flows through to the net cash flow of roughly $2.55 billion, with a staggering 943.38% increase. This improvement culminated in free cash flow jumping to nearly $4B, a record for the company.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla’s 2026 Growth Levers Tesla is making a direct push into the U.K. energy market, beyond selling vehicles and batteries. The company is bidding to supply electricity to British households and businesses across the U.K.\nTesla submitted a formal bid for an electricity license to Ofgem after a notice was posted on a government website. If regulators approve the application, Tesla could start competing with the major electricity suppliers as soon as 2026.​\n\nAnother catalyst sits in energy storage. Tesla reportedly reached a multi‑billion supply agreement with Samsung SDI valued at more than 3 trillion won, or about $2.1B.\nThe deal would run for roughly three years and focus on battery cells for Tesla’s Energy Storage System business, not its EV lineup. Those cells are intended for Megapack and potentially Powerwall, which keeps the emphasis on grid and residential storage demand.\nWall Street’s Numbers Say “Messy Now, Better Later” Tesla’s next real checkpoint for this narrative is its upcoming earnings release, scheduled for Feb. 2, where the Street’s expectations already tell a nuanced story. The current quarter (12/2025) carries an average EPS estimate of $0.34 versus $0.66 a year ago, implying a steep 48.48% year-over-year (YoY) decline as 2025’s margin pressure shows up cleanly in the bottom line.\n\nIts next quarter (03/2026) has estimates at $0.33 versus just $0.15 in the prior year, pointing to a sharp 120% YoY rebound if Tesla can execute.\nThat brings the conversation naturally to how the Street is framing the stock right now, as 40 analysts surveyed on TSLA land on a consensus “Hold” rating. The average price target across that group is $395.32, which is actually below its current price and implies roughly 13% downside from here, not upside.\nConclusion Tesla’s 2025 feels like a stress test that never quite ended, but the numbers and narrative don’t point to a broken story. With earnings reset lower, free cash flow ramping hard, and energy and AI acting as the next growth legs, the setup into 2026 looks more like a “prove‑it” phase than a last stand.\nIn the near term, the stock probably chops around current levels or even gives back some ground as the market waits for cleaner evidence that margins and earnings can catch up to the valuation.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-ai-moves-rewriting-story-191229152.html",
      "Content": "The analyst fair value estimate for Alphabet shares has shifted modestly, from about US$323.70 to roughly US$330.24, supported by a slightly lower 8.24% discount rate and a higher modelled revenue growth rate of around 13.18%. This update lines up with recent research that focuses on Alphabet’s AI execution across Search, YouTube and Cloud, and how products like Gemini, AI Mode and custom TPUs could feed into future growth and valuation. Stay with this article to see how you can keep on top of these changing assumptions and the evolving narrative around Alphabet.\n\nStay updated as the Fair Value for Alphabet shifts by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Alphabet.\nWhat Wall Street Has Been Saying 🐂 Bullish Takeaways\nMany firms highlight Alphabet's AI execution across Search, YouTube and Cloud, with Needham lifting its price target to US$330 after pointing to a \"strong\" Q3, including 15% Search growth, 34% Cloud growth and 15% YouTube growth, and arguing that Alphabet's full stack GenAI go to market is feeding both revenue and margin strength.\nSeveral analysts frame Alphabet as one of the better positioned AI platforms, with Goldman Sachs raising its target to US$288 and Scotiabank moving to US$336 as they point to Gemini adoption, AI monetization and what they describe as strong execution across the business.\nCloud is a recurring positive, with Piper Sandler lifting its target to US$330 on the back of Alphabet's Q3 results, including a Cloud backlog that reached US$155b, and Loop Capital upgrading the stock while arguing that the opportunity for Alphabet's proprietary AI processors is becoming better appreciated.\nNewer coverage is also constructive, with HSBC starting Alphabet with a Buy rating and a US$285 target while emphasizing Gemini, custom chips and core Search and Cloud as key assets, and BNP Paribas Exane initiating with an Outperform rating and a US$355 target.\nSome analysts still flag constraints, often around how much upside is already reflected in the share price and the timing of AI features. Wells Fargo, for example, is keeping an Equal Weight rating while raising its target to US$236 and pointing out that sentiment has turned more positive but that disruption from AI Mode changes to default search is more of a 2026 story.\n\n🐻 Bearish Takeaways\nThere are fewer outright bearish voices in the recent research, but some firms are cautious on ancillary projects. Wells Fargo, for example, questions the economics of Waymo food delivery and sees a challenging path to scale at current cost levels.\nA subset of analysts focus on risk rather than upside, with Wells Fargo highlighting that Google is not entirely \"in the clear\" despite better ad trends and that changes like deeper AI integration into Search could still present future uncertainty.\nSome commentary around AI driven products, like travel tools and agentic booking in AI Mode, has triggered concern among investors about disruption risk for partners, even though firms like KeyBanc and BTIG argue that markets may be overestimating those risks. This leaves open questions around how these shifts might be received over time.\n\nStory Continues\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts? Perhaps you think there's more to the story. Head to the Simply Wall St Community to discover more perspectives or begin writing your own Narrative!\nWhat's in the News Google is planning a large scale global AI infrastructure buildout, including a US$40b commitment to three Texas data centers through 2027, more than US$15b for a data center hub in India’s Andhra Pradesh with a planned 1 gigawatt hyperscale campus in Visakhapatnam, an AI data center on Australia’s Christmas Island tied to a defense cloud deal, and its largest German investment so far focused on data centers and renewable energy projects.\nAlphabet is pushing deeper into AI chips and models, with reports of a seventh generation Ironwood TPU that is more than 4x faster than the prior version, pitches to place these TPUs inside Meta and large banks’ data centers, and an open sourced Coral NPU IP initiative with VeriSilicon aimed at ultra low energy edge LLM applications.\nGoogle is broadening AI partnerships, including talks around a high tens of billions cloud deal and deeper investment with Anthropic, a reported AI model agreement with Apple to power a revamped Siri using a 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini model at roughly US$1b a year, and an expanded role as cloud and AI provider for the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games and NBCUniversal coverage.\nRegulatory and legal items remain active, with Google ordered to pay €573m in two German antitrust damages cases tied to comparison shopping, an EU probe being prepared into news publisher rankings under the Digital Markets Act, a class action lawsuit over alleged defects in Nest smart home devices, continued scrutiny of the Play Store following the Epic Games antitrust settlement proposal, and a U.S. Supreme Court decision that left parts of an injunction in place. At the same time, Alphabet is pairing its AI and data center expansion with emissions related commitments such as Amazon rainforest restoration via Mombak, a partnership with NextEra to restart Iowa’s Duane Arnold nuclear plant to power AI and cloud operations, and a CO2 removal purchase agreement with Ebb for 3,500 tons using ocean based carbon removal technology.\n\nHow This Changes the Fair Value For Alphabet Fair Value: The analyst fair value estimate has shifted from about US$323.70 to roughly US$330.24 per share.\nDiscount Rate: The applied discount rate is now about 8.24%, compared with 8.26% previously. This reflects a small adjustment in the risk assumption used in the model.\nRevenue Growth: The modelled revenue growth rate is now roughly 13.18%, up from about 12.77%.\nNet Profit Margin: The assumed net profit margin remains broadly similar, moving from about 30.12% to around 30.10%.\nFuture P/E: The future P/E assumption has shifted slightly higher, from about 28.88x to roughly 29.14x.\n\n🔔 Never Miss an Update: Follow The Narrative Narratives on Simply Wall St let you connect the story you see for a company with the numbers behind it.

      "Content": "Apple (AAPL) continues to draw attention from investors as recent returns have been mixed, with a 1 day decline of 0.3%, a 1 week decline of 1.0% and a past month decline of 2.8%.\nSee our latest analysis for Apple.\nAt a share price of US$271.01, Apple’s recent 1 month share price decline sits against a 90 day share price return of 5.7%. Its 1 year total shareholder return of 11.1% and 3 year total shareholder return a little above a doubling highlight that long term holders have seen stronger results than recent momentum implies.\n\nIf Apple’s recent pullback has you reassessing the tech space, this can be a useful moment to scan high growth tech and AI stocks that may fit your return and risk preferences.\nWith Apple trading at US$271.01 and sitting at a small discount to some analyst targets but a premium to certain intrinsic estimates, the key question is whether this recent softness signals a buying opportunity or if the market is already pricing in future growth.\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 5.4% Undervalued With Apple last closing at US$271.01 and the most followed narrative pointing to fair value around US$287, the gap comes down to how you see future earnings power and margins.\nIntroduction and integration of AI-powered features (Apple Intelligence) across devices and platforms, leveraging proprietary silicon, is expected to drive a new upgrade cycle and enhance device differentiation, supporting higher ASPs, sustained product revenue growth, and cost efficiencies that improve gross margins and earnings.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious what kind of revenue pace, profit margin profile, and future P/E multiple are baked into that valuation gap? The full narrative lays out a detailed earnings path and the implied pricing power behind it.\nResult: Fair Value of $287 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, you still need to weigh regulatory pressure on the App Store, as well as tariffs or supply chain disruptions, which could affect Apple’s margins and earnings power.\nFind out about the key risks to this Apple narrative.\nAnother View: When Fair Value Signals Diverge While the consensus narrative sits around a fair value of roughly US$287 and describes Apple as undervalued by about 5.4%, the SWS DCF model presents a different result. On that approach, fair value is US$223.60, which would put today’s US$271.01 share price in overvalued territory.\nThis gap depends on what you think Apple can earn and how long it can sustain those margins. If the cash flow path built into the DCF seems too cautious to you, the narrative fair value may be more in line with your view. If it seems closer to your expectations, it may be worth asking whether the current price gives you enough room for error.\n\nStory Continues\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out Apple for example ).

      "Content": "Meta Platforms (META) is back in focus after agreeing to buy AI agent startup Manus for more than US$2b. At the same time, the company is cutting metaverse spending and leaning harder into AI driven tools across its core apps.\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms.\nDespite the Manus acquisition and a string of AI driven product updates, Meta Platforms’ 1 day share price return of a 1.47% decline and 90 day share price return of an 8.79% decline suggest momentum has cooled recently, even as the 3 year total shareholder return of more than 4x remains very strong.\n\nIf this AI push has you thinking beyond just one company, it could be a good moment to broaden your watchlist with high growth tech and AI stocks .\nWith Meta now trading at $650.41, talk of it being the “cheapest” of the Magnificent Seven, a value score of 5, and an indicated intrinsic discount of about 39% raises the question: is this genuine mispricing, or is the market already baking in years of AI driven growth?\nMost Popular Narrative: 10.1% Undervalued Against Meta Platforms’ last close at $650.41, the most followed narrative points to a higher fair value anchor, which hinges heavily on its AI driven ad engine and long term investment program.\nRead the complete narrative.\nAccording to yiannisz, this valuation leans heavily on robust ad monetization, strong profitability and a future earnings multiple that assumes Meta keeps turning attention into high margin revenue. Want to see how revenue growth, margins and that forward P/E all come together in one fair value number? The full narrative breaks down the exact assumptions that bridge today’s price to that higher target.\n\nStory Continues\nResult: Fair Value of $723.11 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this hinges on Meta sustaining AI driven ad performance while managing Reality Labs losses; any regulatory hit to data use could quickly challenge that thesis.\nFind out about the key risks to this Meta Platforms narrative.\n\nBuild Your Own Meta Platforms Narrative If you see the numbers differently or just prefer to piece together your own view from the raw data, you can build a complete Meta story in just a few minutes, starting with Do it your way .\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards investors are optimistic about regarding Meta Platforms.\n\nLooking for more investment ideas? If Meta has sharpened your interest, do not stop here.

      "Content": "TSM\n\nGoldman Sachs just dropped its biggest AI-driven calls so far this year, as it lifted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s stock price target in a big way.\nThe bank bumped its Taiwan-listed target to NT$2,330 from NT$1,720 , a move that may seem relatively modest until you do the math.\nTSMC’s U.S.-listed ADR represents five Taiwan shares, which equate to an ADR target of roughly $370–$375 , representing a 35% increase compared to Goldman’s previous call. With TSMC stock trading near $319.61 , that suggests a potential 16% to 17% upside .\n\nAfter years of covering semiconductor cycles, a move this aggressive often suggests the bottleneck is becoming tougher to ignore.\nMr. Market is clearly upbeat about its potential to surprise in 2026, having risen almost 10% in the past month, while the S&P 500 has remained largely unchanged.\nThe primary reason for this is TSMC; AI demand is growing well beyond current expectations, and with it powering the infrastructure behind it, there’s still a lot to be excited about with the stock.\nGoldman Sachs thinks TSMC’s AI run is just getting started Goldman Sachs’ aggressive take rests on the premise that AI is a multi-year growth engine for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , effectively reshaping demand, pricing, and margins.\nAnalyst Bruce Lu argues that demand for AI “tokens” is growing at an exponential pace, keeping advanced-chip demand ahead of supply. That imbalance gives TSMC significant leverage, even as it spends heavily to expand its capacity.\n\nLu feels that 2026 is a year set to be “all about AI.”\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\nDespite three consecutive years of eye-popping investment, he sees margins rising as new fabs come online and boost productivity.\nIn particular, the tight capacity at TSMC’s most advanced 3nm and 5nm nodes will persist through 2027.\nThe TSMC numbers are tough to ignore: Earnings outlook: Lu has bumped his 2026 and 2027 EPS estimates by 9% to 15% , with earnings per share expected to reach NT$100 ($3.20) by 2027 .\nGrowth expectations: Sales are projected to increase by 30% in 2026 and 28% in 2027 , representing a substantial rise from prior forecasts of 22% in both years.\nInvestment and margins: TSMC is expected to spend more than $150 billion in capex from 2026-2028 , including $54 billion in 2027 (gross margins above 60%).\n\nStory Continues\nInside the AI bottleneck that’s working in TSMC’s favor TSMC has effectively become the toll booth of the AI supply chain , performing remarkably better than the broader tech space.\nThe receipts back that up.\nFor perspective, in Q3 2025, TSMC reported $33.1 billion in sales for its high-performance computing platform, accounting for 57% of sales, compared to 30% from smartphones .\n\nRelated: Veteran analyst delivers blunt 3-word take on Tesla after report\nPerhaps an even more telling statistic is that 74% of wafer sales came from 7nm-and-below , along with 23% from 3nm (the go-to for AI chips).\nMoreover, demand remains as robust as ever.\nThe company said it continues to see healthy demand for AI-related products, while updating its full-year sales forecast to close near the mid-30% range .\nThe AI giant is also maintaining a capital expenditure (capex) level of $40 to $42 billion .\nImportantly, 10% to 20% of that spending is earmarked for advanced packaging, testing, and masks, the unglamorous plumbing that is mission-critical for GPUs to ship on time.\nThat plumbing is imperative because advanced packaging, particularly TSMC’s method CoWoS, remains the key choke point for the industry.\n\nAs we look ahead, CoWoS capacity is expected to continue growing, with Bernstein estimating that TSMC’s capacity will increase to 125,000 wafers per month by the end of 2026 , Investing.com reports.\nDespite the impressive ramp-up, giants like Nvidia are blunt in saying that packaging constraints are likely to persist.\nA technical signal that traders rarely ignore is flashing on TSM stock Another pertinent bullish take comes from TheStreet Pro’s veteran analyst and trader Stephen Guilfoyle , nicknamed “The Sarge.”\nPut simply, Guilfoyle lays out the case that TSM stock has moved from a consolidation period into a renewed uptrend.\nHis core argument centers on the formation of a bullish “ inverted head-and-shoulders ” pattern, indicating that the stock spent months building a foundation, pushing back above key levels that traders are closely monitoring.\n\nTSM has reclaimed both the short-term and medium-term moving averages, indicating that buyers are in control and momentum is building without triggering “overbought” warnings.\nThis sets the stage for more upside, as Guilfoyle explains.\nBased on that technical backdrop, he assigns an even higher price target of $377 on TSM stock, arguing its current strength reflects improving fundamentals .\nRelated: Top analyst resets price target on Micron stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 5, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Key Points Nvidia will outperform most of its peers in 2026.\nNvidia's revenue growth will accelerate into the next year.\nNvidia will become the first $6 trillion company.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just wrapped up another impressive year, rising 39%. Any investor is happy with those results, but 2025 is over; what will 2026 bring? I think investors have plenty of reasons to be excited about Nvidia's stock heading into 2026, as the AI buildout is still gaining momentum. This bodes well for Nvidia, and I think it's a top stock to buy for 2026.\nI've got three bolt predictions surrounding Nvidia's stock, and I think each of these will cause it to be one of the best stocks to own in the market.\n1. Nvidia will be the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock The \" Magnificent Seven \" cohort of stocks describes seven of the largest and most dominant tech companies in the market. It includes: Nvidia, Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla .\nEach of these companies is a heavy hitter in the tech realm, and becoming the top performer out of all seven of these is no easy task. In 2025, Alphabet took the crown as the best performer, rising 65% for the year, while Nvidia came in second place. However, I think Nvidia's 2026 performance will be even greater than 2025's as its revenue is accelerating to wrap up the year.\n\nIn the company's second quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia's revenue growth was 56%. In Q3, that figure rose to 62%. Wall Street analysts expect 67% growth in the fourth quarter. That's impressive growth acceleration from the world's largest company, but there are some more catalysts upcoming in 2026 that could increase Nvidia's growth rate.\n2. Nvidia will top $350 billion in revenue in 2026 Nvidia is launching its new architecture in 2026, known as Rubin. While Rubin's improvements over Blackwell are impressive, they require an 800-volt infrastructure, which will require data centers to update their setup, which Nvidia also sells. That will provide a huge revenue boost for Nvidia throughout 2026.\n\nAnother factor is Nvidia's return to China. Nvidia got approval from the U.S. to start selling its China-specific graphics processing units (GPUs) again, but must pay a 25% tax on each one it sells. While it remains to be seen if Nvidia will pass along this price hike to its customers or if it will eat the cost, it will drive further revenue increases. It also remains to be seen if Beijing will allow the sales.\n\nStory Continues\nFor FY 2027 (ending January 2027), the average Wall Street analyst expects $320 billion in revenue, up from an estimated $213 billion in FY 2026. However, Nvidia consistently outperforms expectations and has several massive growth trends that analysts may not fully appreciate. As a result, I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia's revenue tops $350 billion next year, indicating a 64% growth rate from FY 2026's projected levels.\n\n3. Nvidia will surpass the $6 trillion market cap level Currently, Nvidia's market cap is about $4.6 trillion. However, if Nvidia achieves $350 billion in revenue at its current 53% profit margin, that would result in $186 billion in profits. Nvidia's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 46. If we decrease that premium to 35 times earnings at $186 billion in profits, that results in a $6.5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe rise from a $4.6 trillion market cap to a $6.5 trillion one results in a stock gain of about 41%. That's a better year than in 2025, and will result in market-crushing returns if it pans out. That makes Nvidia a solid buy again in 2026, and investors should take the opportunity now to load up on Nvidia's stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nKey Points Demand for Broadcom's specialized semiconductors is driving its stock.\nWall Street analysts expect monster revenue growth in 2026 and 2027.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nFew companies had as successful a 2025 as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . The stock rose an impressive 50%, but there could be plenty of room to run with the industry that it's in.\n\nWhile Broadcom has a wide product lineup, investors are most excited about one thing: custom artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips. In the right application, these can outperform the best products from Nvidia at a lower price point.\nThat's an extremely attractive proposition, and is one that more companies are starting to explore. But does that make Broadcom one of the best AI stocks for 2026?\nBroadcom's growth could be impressive in 2026 Looking at Broadcom's company-wide performance doesn't yield such impressive results. In its fiscal 2025's fourth quarter (ended Nov. 2), revenue rose 28% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 37%. Those are solid results, but other companies in the big tech realm are putting up as good or better numbers.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's custom AI chips are buried underneath these results and are expected to deliver outsized returns in 2026 and beyond. Of the $18 billion that Broadcom generated in the quarter , AI semiconductor revenue made up $6.5 billion of it. This division grew at a blistering-fast pace of 74% year over year. For comparison, Nvidia's latest quarter (ended Oct. 26) saw data center growth of 66% year over year. This means that Broadcom's AI-focused division is growing faster than Nvidia's, showcasing the huge demand for its services.\nBut that growth isn't over. For Q1, they expect AI semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion -- more than double what it generated last year. The fact that Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue is ramping up so quickly showcases the huge demand for its products. But why are they so popular?\n\nASIC chips will continue to grow in popularity Most companies don't have the expertise needed to design their own chip. While they may be able to outline how they want the chip to operate, designing a chip for production is a whole different skill set. That's where Broadcom comes in.\nBroadcom's expertise, combined with its clients' design, yields a potent combination that can produce a chip that outperforms broader-use chips like graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. These chips are known as ASICs, application-specific integrated circuits. ASICs can't handle a wide variety of workloads like GPUs can, but when a workload is configured properly, an ASIC can deliver better performance at a lower price point.\n\nStory Continues\nThe most prominent example of an ASIC success is Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The TPU has been Alphabet's secret weapon to catch up in the generative AI realm, and there is even the possibility that Alphabet will begin selling these to other companies. However, the success of the TPU has also driven many companies to Broadcom, and many AI businesses, like OpenAI, are planning on launching their own chip in the near future.\n\nThat's why Broadcom is expected to grow so much in the next few years. In its fiscal 2025, Broadcom's revenue totaled $63.9 billion, up 24% year over year. For fiscal 2026, the average estimate of 42 Wall Street analysts indicates 50% revenue growth to $96 billion. In fiscal 2027, its revenue growth is projected to be 36%, with $130 billion in revenue.\nThat's a huge growth explosion, and it can all be traced back to ASICs becoming a huge part of many companies' artificial intelligence strategies. As a result, I think Broadcom is an excellent stock to buy now and hold throughout 2026 and beyond. Broadcom has a ton of momentum in its business, and the only thing that will stop it is if AI hyperscalers decide to quit spending money on data centers, which I don't see happening anytime soon.\n\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?

      "Title": "After Nvidia’s Groq deal, meet the other AI chip startups that may be in play—and one looking to disrupt them all",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-groq-deal-meet-other-181038844.html",
      "Content": "GROQ.PVT\n\nINTC\n\nCESY.PVT\n\nNvidia dropped a surprise announcement on Christmas Eve: a $20 billion deal to license AI chip startup Groq’s technology and bring over most of its team, including cofounder and CEO Jonathan Ross. It was a move that hinted Nvidia is no longer assuming its GPUs will not be the only chips useful for the next big phase of AI deployment: running already trained AI models to do everything from answering queries and generating code to analyzing an image—a process known as inference—and doing so at a huge scale.\n\nThe Groq deal bolsters the standing of other startups building their own AI chips, including Cerebras, D-Matrix, and SambaNova—which Intel has reportedly signed a term sheet to acquire—as well as newer players like U.K.-based chip startup Fractile. It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.\nKarl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI Research, pointed to the Microsoft-backed D-Matrix, which raised $275 million last month at a $2 billion valuation. Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models. “I’m sure D-Matrix is a pretty happy startup right now,” Freund said. “I suspect their next round will be at a much higher valuation.”\n\nCerebras, another inference-focused chip company, also appears well positioned. Known for its dinner-plate-sized &#8220;wafer-scale&#8221; chip designed to run extremely large models on a single piece of silicon, Cerebras has filed for an IPO after a previous delay. Freund said the company has increasingly been viewed as a potential acquisition target as well. “You don’t want to wait until after the IPO, when it’s more expensive,” he said. “From that perspective, Cerebras is sitting pretty right now.”\nNvidia-Groq deal has clarified market&#8217;s direction Executives at these companies say Nvidia’s move has helped clarify the market’s direction. “When [the Nvidia-Groq deal] happened, we said, ‘Finally, the market recognizes it,’” Sid Sheth, CEO of D-Matrix, told Fortune . “I think what Nvidia has really done is they said, Okay, this approach is a winning approach.”\n\nAnd Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman posted on X that, in the past, the perception that Nvidia GPUs were all you needed for AI acted as a moat, keeping AI chip startups for nibbling away at Nvidia&#8217;s marketshare. But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote. “It reflects a growing industry reality—the inference market is fragmenting, and a new category has emerged where speed isn&#8217;t a feature—it&#8217;s the entire value proposition. A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.”\n\nStory Continues\nStill, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally. Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said the chip sector remains a difficult one for venture investors, given the high capital requirements and long timelines. “A lot of VCs stopped investing in chips 10 or 15 years ago,” Murphy said. “It’s capital-intensive, it takes years to get a product out, and the outcomes are hard to predict.”\n\nThat said, he pointed to Fireworks, and AI inference platform which raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October, as a startup with a technical advantage, thanks to a founding team filled with engineers who built Pytorch an. But he added that it remains unclear how much of the current enthusiasm reflects genuine technical differentiation. “it&#8217;s hard to tell who&#8217;s really got something significant versus the tide is [raising] all boats, which is what seems to be going on,” he said, adding that consolidation across the sector now appears increasingly likely.\nNew entrant seeks true disruption But at least one veteran of the AI hardware world argues that even today’s inference-focused startups are not truly disruptive.\nNaveen Rao, former SVP of AI at Databricks and founder of MosaicML, recently left Databricks to start Unconventional AI, which last month confirmed a massive $475 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures. His critique: companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.\n\nAfter Nvidia’s Groq deal validated demand for faster, more efficient inference, startups that fit neatly into today’s AI stack suddenly look far more valuable — not because they reinvented computing, Rao argues, but because they work within it. Unconventional AI is pursuing a more radical path: building new hardware that exploits the physical behavior of silicon itself, and redesigning neural networks to match it.\n“We&#8217;ve been building the same fundamental machine for 80 years, a numeric digital machine,” he said. “But there was never one workload that dominated even more than 2% of all compute cycles.” That is changing, he explained: In a few years, 95% of all compute will be used for AI.\nFrom that standpoint, it’s important to construct an entirely different machine than what is built today, he said. However, Rao says the effort could take five years or more to bear fruit — and is not intended to capitalize on the current inference boom.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nCRWV\n\nSSNLF\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares climbed by the most since April, as the world’s largest contract chipmaker rides a continued wave of optimism over artificial intelligence demand into the new year.\nShares of the key supplier to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. jumped as much as 6.9% to touch a new record high in Taipei. That came after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its TSMC price target 35% to NT$2,330, citing expectations of another year of solid growth. The company’s US depositary receipts were up 1.7% in New York trading on Monday. Tech stocks across Asia and the US also gained, including Samsung Electronics Co., Intel Corp., Arm Holdings Plc and CoreWeave Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinkholes and Quake-Hit Roads Expose Japan’s Infrastructure Emergency\nInvestors are plowing cash into AI bets despite recent concerns about a bubble. The sector was once again the biggest boost for equities in Asia as the fear of missing out overcame concerns about short-term volatility due to the US-Venezuela conflict.\n“We view AI as a multi-year growth engine for TSMC,” Goldman analysts including Bruce Lu wrote in a report. Lu noted the company’s profit margins are improving, even as he projected it will spend $150 billion over the next three years to increase capacity.\nAmong other chip stocks, South Korea’s Samsung extended gains to a fifth-straight session. The company is expected to report preliminary results later this week that will provide further clues on whether earnings justify the sector’s big gains.\nElsewhere, shares of Japanese equipment makers Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. advanced more than 7% each Monday. Chinese chip stocks gained after the nation’s integrated circuit investment fund raised its stake in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., and DeepSeek flagged a more efficient approach to training AI.\n\nTSMC helped drive Taiwan’s Taiex up more than 3% to a record of over 30,000, a level that “seemed almost impossible” until recently, according to Juan Ching-hwa, Taiwan’s deputy finance minister. Still, given the chipmaker’s dominance there are “hopes for a more balanced structure,” he told lawmakers Monday.\nThe Hsinchu-based firm’s shares surged 44% in 2025, pushing its market value above $1 trillion for the first time. That reflects increased investor confidence in its central position amid the AI boom, with many of the world’s chip companies relying on its foundry services.\n“For leading-edge semiconductor, capacity from TSMC is the king,” Bernstein analysts including Mark Li wrote in a note dated Friday. This year “is still all about AI,” the analysts said, while recommending investors “focus on quality” given worries of a bubble.\n\nStory Continues\nTSMC is due to report earnings on Jan. 15. Capital market activity may be another near-term catalyst for the sector, especially for Chinese stocks. Around 11 AI-related companies have laid out plans to list in Hong Kong this month, with proceeds of as much as $4.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, valuations are seen supporting Asian shares relative to global peers. A gauge of the region’s tech hardware companies is trading at 16 times forward earnings estimates compared with 25 times for the Nasdaq 100.\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nOzempic Users Actually Spend More Dining Out.

Foxconn builds some of Nvidia's most advanced AI server systems and continues to ramp capacity to meet customer demand.\nSeparately, Foxconn said it expects to deliver a large supercomputing cluster it is building for Nvidia, in partnership with the Taiwanese government, during the first half of the year.",

      "Content": "INTC\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nLAS VEGAS — Qualcomm ( QCOM ) is continuing to push deeper into the PC market at CES 2026, rolling out its newest entry-level chip for Microsoft ( MSFT ) Windows laptops.\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus joins the company's previously announced Snapdragon X2 Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme processors as part of the company's push to take on longtime PC chip leader Intel ( INTC ) and rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ).\n\nQualcomm is seeking to diversify its portfolio of products to ease its dependence on the smartphone space. The company kicked off its effort at last year's CES with its original Snapdragon X processor.\nThe chip technology developer reported $44.3 billion in total revenue in 2025. Of that amount, $38.4 billion came from its QCT business, which includes sales related to chips for smartphones, PCs, and autos.\nAccording to Qualcomm, the Snapdragon X2 Plus will be available with either a six-core or 10-core CPU and provides up to 35% faster peak performance versus the prior-generation Plus and requires 43% less power.\nThe company is also touting the chips' multiday battery life and built-in neural processing unit, or NPU, which Qualcomm says packs up to 80 trillions of operations per second (TOPS) of performance. TOPS is a general measure of how well a device can run AI apps.\n\n\"Modern professionals and creators want to do more, create more, and push the limits of generative AI and all-day performance. Snapdragon X2 Plus platform delivers the power, efficiency and intelligence to surpass their ambitions, making each experience more responsive and personal,\" Kedar Kondap, Qualcomm's SVP and GM of computing and gaming, said in a statement.\nQualcomm's move into the consumer and business PC space comes as Intel continues its turnaround effort. Once the undisputed leader in the PC chip industry, Intel has been losing market share to AMD.\nBut in October, Intel debuted its Core Ultra Series 3, based on its long-gestating 18A technology, which could help stave off further share deterioration and give Qualcomm and AMD a more difficult fight ahead.\nIn addition to the X2 Plus, Qualcomm unveiled a new robotics initiative at CES 2026, including a drive toward humanoid robots. The company said it believes the market for physical AI, another term for robots, will be worth as much as $1 trillion by 2040, and it's looking to get a piece of that action.\n\nPart of that includes Qualcomm's new Dragonwing IQ10 chip for physical AI systems ranging from industrial robotics to humanoid robots.\nBut Qualcomm isn't the only company looking to make waves in the robotics industry. Nvidia, Intel, AMD, and a host of other chipmakers are aiming to become the go-to firm for physical AI as the technology continues to mature over the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "SSNLF\n\nIn recent months, Alphabet has deepened its role in artificial intelligence, winning the Pentagon’s GenAI.mil contract, integrating its Gemini model across products, expanding TPU partnerships, and agreeing to acquire clean‑energy developer Intersect Power for about US$4.75 billion in cash plus assumed debt to support its fast‑growing AI data center needs.\nThese moves, alongside Google Cloud’s AI‑driven growth, Samsung’s expanded use of Gemini on Galaxy devices, and new monetization paths ranging from TPUs to robotaxis, highlight how Alphabet is turning its broad AI ecosystem into an interconnected commercial platform rather than a single‑product bet.\nWe’ll now examine how Alphabet’s Pentagon-backed GenAI.mil role reframes its investment narrative around AI infrastructure, cloud growth, and long-term spending.\n\nExplore 29 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research.\nAlphabet Investment Narrative Recap To own Alphabet, you need to believe its AI heavy model can keep driving Search, YouTube and Cloud while justifying very high capital spending and intense competition. The Pentagon backed GenAI.mil win and the Intersect Power deal both reinforce the near term AI infrastructure story, but they do not materially change the main catalyst, which is whether Google Cloud and Gemini monetization can offset rising capex and margin pressure, or the key risk of ad and regulatory dependence.\n\nThe Intersect Power acquisition, at about US$4.75 billion in cash plus assumed debt, ties Alphabet’s AI ambitions directly to long dated data center power needs, sitting alongside Google Cloud’s AI driven backlog growth as a core catalyst for how efficiently those record capital expenditures translate into future earnings resilience.\nYet against this progress, investors should also be aware of Alphabet’s record AI focused capex and the margin risk if revenue growth fails to keep pace...\nRead the full narrative on Alphabet (it's free!)\nAlphabet's narrative projects $512.6 billion revenue and $148.4 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Alphabet's forecasts yield a $330.24 fair value , a 5% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Private investors in the Simply Wall St Community have 187 fair value estimates for Alphabet, ranging from US$171.36 to US$340.15, underscoring how far apart individual views can be. Against that backdrop, Alphabet’s record AI driven capital expenditure plans and the question of whether Cloud and Gemini monetization can keep margins healthy give you a concrete lens to compare these different viewpoints.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 187 other fair value estimates on Alphabet - why the stock might be worth as much as 8% more than the current price!\nBuild Your Own Alphabet Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "KLA (KLAC) shares slipped 1.5% after a third quarter that delivered double digit revenue and EPS growth versus expectations, putting the focus on how AI demand and export limits might shape the story from here.\nSee our latest analysis for KLA.\nThat post earnings dip sits against a strong recent run, with KLA’s 90 day share price return of 17.49% and 1 year total shareholder return of 86.20% pointing to momentum that has been building rather than fading.\n\nIf KLA’s AI driven story has your attention, it could be a good moment to see what else is out there in high growth tech and AI stocks .\nWith the shares up 86.20% over the past year and now trading at US$1,274.47, only about 3.6% below the average analyst target, investors may wonder whether there is still an attractive entry point or whether potential future growth is already reflected in the current price.\nMost Popular Narrative: 1.7% Undervalued The most followed narrative pegs KLA’s fair value at about US$1,296.89 per share, a touch above the latest close of US$1,274.47, suggesting only a small valuation gap.\nThe advanced packaging market is experiencing early-stage, secular growth fueled by adoption of 2.5D/3D architectures and HBM, driving KLA's advanced packaging revenue target for 2025 up nearly 80% year-over-year with expectations that this trend is \"closer to the beginning than the end\"; this directly expands KLA's addressable market and should provide multi-year upside to revenue.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious what kind of revenue mix, margin profile, and earnings multiple are built into that fair value? The narrative leans on specific long run assumptions for growth, profitability, and capital intensity. The full story sits in how those pieces fit together.\nResult: Fair Value of $1,296.89 (ABOUT RIGHT)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, that story can wobble if China demand weakens further or if tariffs and higher costs eat into the margin assumptions behind that 1.7% undervaluation.\nFind out about the key risks to this KLA narrative.\nAnother View: Multiples Paint A Richer Picture That 1.7% “about right” fair value story sits awkwardly next to our own P/E based work, which indicates that KLA appears expensive. The shares trade on a 39.5x P/E versus a fair ratio of 29.4x, a gap that suggests there may be less room for disappointment than the narrative implies.\nKLA also trades at a higher multiple than the broader US Semiconductor industry at 37.3x, although it is slightly cheaper than close peers at 41.5x. If market sentiment cools, does the share price move toward that 29.4x fair ratio, or do earnings need to account for more of the adjustment from here?\n\nStory Continues\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own KLA Narrative If you are not fully on board with this story or simply prefer to test the numbers yourself, you can build a fresh KLA view in minutes, starting with Do it your way .\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards investors are optimistic about regarding KLA.\nLooking for more investment ideas?

      "Content": "TMICF\n\n3231.TW\n\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia, January 05, 2026 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Magna AI, a global full-value-chain AI transformation leader established through a partnership between Trend Micro and Wistron, today announced that it has joined the elite ranks of global AI organizations delivering production-scale intelligence as part of the NVIDIA Inception program.\n\nMagna AI’s participation reflects deep technical alignment with NVIDIA ’s AI platforms as part of its ongoing work designing, building, and operating large-scale AI systems that deliver operational intelligence and measurable outcomes for enterprises and governments.

      "Title": "Is Meta Platforms (META) Still Attractive After AI Investment Push And Steady Share Price?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-still-attractive-160700060.html",
      "Content": "If you are wondering whether Meta Platforms at US$650.41 is priced for perfection or still offers value, you are not alone. This article is built to help you frame that question clearly.\nThe share price has been fairly steady over shorter periods, with a 1.3% decline over the last week and a 3.4% decline over the last month. The 1 year return sits at 3.5%, and the 3 year return is very large.\nRecent headlines have continued to focus on Meta's push in areas such as artificial intelligence tools across its apps and ongoing investments in virtual and augmented reality, as well as continued scrutiny of its social platforms from regulators and policymakers. Together, these themes help shape how investors think about both the growth potential and the risks around the current share price.\nOn our checks, Meta Platforms scores 5 out of 6 on valuation, with a value score of 5/6 suggesting the stock screens as undervalued on most metrics. Next, we will look at the usual valuation methods before finishing with a way to think about value that goes beyond any single model.\n\nFind out why Meta Platforms's 3.5% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\nApproach 1: Meta Platforms Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company might be worth today by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to the present using a required rate of return.\nFor Meta Platforms, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow (FCF) is about $58.81b. Using a 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, analysts provide explicit FCF estimates out to 2030, with Simply Wall St extrapolating beyond the initial analyst horizon. On this basis, projected FCF for 2030 is $119.72b, with interim annual projections in between these points.\n\nWhen those expected cash flows are discounted back to today in this model, the estimated intrinsic value for Meta Platforms comes out at about $1,063.23 per share. Compared with the current share price of US$650.41, the DCF output implies the stock screens as around 38.8% undervalued in this framework.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Meta Platforms is undervalued by 38.8%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 870 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Meta Platforms.\nApproach 2: Meta Platforms Price vs Earnings For a profitable business like Meta Platforms, the P/E ratio is a useful shorthand for what the market is willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. It links directly to your experience as a shareholder, because earnings per share are a core input into many valuation frameworks.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat counts as a \"normal\" P/E often reflects how quickly earnings are expected to grow and how much risk investors see in those earnings. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.\nMeta Platforms currently trades on a P/E of 28.01x. That is above the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 15.45x, but below the peer group average of 34.93x. Simply Wall St also estimates a proprietary Fair Ratio for Meta of 39.09x, which is the P/E level they would expect given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk profile.\n\nThe Fair Ratio can be more useful than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for Meta's specific characteristics rather than treating all companies as if they were the same. Compared with the current 28.01x P/E, the Fair Ratio of 39.09x indicates that the shares appear undervalued on this metric.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1462 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Meta Platforms Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This is a simple tool on Simply Wall St's Community page where you connect your view of Meta Platforms, including future revenue, earnings and margins, to a financial forecast and a fair value. You can then compare that fair value to the current share price to help you decide what action makes sense. The Narrative updates automatically as new news or earnings arrive, and different investors can express very different stories, such as one Narrative using a fair value of US$538.09 and another using US$837.15 for the same Meta stock.\n\nFor Meta Platforms however we will make it straightforward, with previews of two leading Meta Platforms Narratives:\n🐂 Meta Platforms Bull Case\nFair value used in this bullish Narrative: US$837.15 per share\nImplied discount to this fair value at US$650.41: about 22.3% undervalued\nRevenue growth assumption: 16.67% a year\nAI driven ad targeting, messaging monetization and a broad social and commerce ecosystem are expected to support durable revenue growth and high engagement across Meta's platforms.\nHeavy investment in AI infrastructure and Reality Labs is treated as a long term enabler of scale, with analysts building in higher revenue and substantial earnings by 2028.\nKey risks include rising capex and operating expenses, ongoing Reality Labs losses and regulatory pressure, which could weigh on margins if revenue does not keep pace.\n\n🐻 Meta Platforms Bear Case\nFair value used in this more cautious Narrative: US$538.09 per share\nImplied premium to this fair value at US$650.41: about 20.9% overvalued\nRevenue growth assumption: 10.5% a year\nMeta is expected to keep a strong position in social media, AI and AR or VR, but the author sees a limit to how much of that is already reflected in the share price.\nThe thesis relies on continued ARPU growth, AR or VR adoption and cost cutting, while acknowledging large ongoing losses in Reality Labs and high AI capex commitments.\nRegulation, ad market dependence, execution risk in the metaverse and cybersecurity concerns feature as central risks that could restrain earnings and the valuation multiple.\nPutting these side by side gives you a practical range of outcomes, from a bullish fair value of about US$837 to a more conservative US$538, so you can decide which set of assumptions feels closer to your own view of Meta's future.\nCurious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

      "Content": "AVGO\n\nHPE\n\nQualcomm Incorporated QCOM shares have gained a modest 8.2% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 35.7%. Although it has outperformed peers like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE, it lagged Broadcom Inc. AVGO. While Hewlett Packard is up 5.7%, Broadcom has surged 47% over this period.\nOne-Year QCOM Stock Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQCOM Plagued by Waning Margins A combination of factors has led to a placid performance by the chip-manufacturing firm. Qualcomm's margins have declined over the years due to high operating expenses and R&D (research & development) costs. The company expects softness in the handset market and a weaker overall mix of devices to continue in the near future. The shift in the share among original equipment manufacturers at the premium tier has reduced the near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from the Snapdragon platform.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm faces stiff competitive pressures from rivals Broadcom and Hewlett Packard. Aggressive competition from low-cost chip manufacturers and established players in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum over the next three to four years, a major portion of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may weigh on Qualcomm's margins.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBitter U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Ties Hurt QCOM Moreover, Qualcomm is expected to face softness in demand from China. The chip-making firm has a significant presence in more than 12 cities in China, aiming to drive advancements in semiconductors and mobile telecommunications for the larger benefit. The company has been a key supplier of chips and other related components to local smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Huawei and its spin-off brand Honor. However, it appears that Qualcomm is increasingly finding it difficult to maintain its operations in the communist nation due to the continued U.S.-China trade spat.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department has long imposed various trade restrictions against China that banned the sale of high-tech equipment, chips, components and related technology to develop high-end smartphones and AI-enabled chips. As Washington tightens trade restrictions, Beijing has intensified its push for self-sufficiency in critical industries. This shift poses a dual challenge for QCOM, as it faces potential market restrictions and increased competition from domestic chipmakers. In addition, weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, resulted in elevated customer inventory levels.\n\nStory Continues\nQCOM Buoyed by Snapdragon, AI & Automotive Businesses Despite the short-term headwinds, Qualcomm is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. The company is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. In addition, the chip manufacturer envisions solid growth opportunities within the mobile space, driven by the strength of its Snapdragon portfolio.\n\nLeveraging processors with multi-core CPUs with cutting-edge features, amazing graphics and worldwide network connectivity, Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platforms are fast with superb power efficiency. Smartphones and mobile devices built with Snapdragon mobile platforms enable immersive augmented reality and virtual reality experiences, brilliant camera capabilities, superior 4G LTE and 5G connectivity with state-of-the-art security solutions.\n\nQualcomm is currently foraying deeper into the realm of AI capabilities within the laptop and desktop business with the launch of the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops. The strategy is aimed at moving beyond the slowing smartphone industry, which is its primary breadwinner. In addition to diversifying its revenue stream, this is likely to further extend QCOM’s AI footprint.\n\nIt has completed the acquisition of U.K.-based chip firm Alphawave Semi for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion. The buyout offers Qualcomm an opportunity to expand its presence in high-growth applications, including data centers, AI, data networking and data storage.\n\nThe automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and C-V2X solutions are fueling emerging automotive industry trends such as the growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification. Qualcomm is gradually gaining traction in the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems market with the buyout of Autotalks. With seamless access to Autotalks’ comprehensive V2X expertise, Qualcomm has been able to offer an extensive suite of automotive-qualified global V2X solutions for installation in vehicles, as well as 2-wheelers and roadside infrastructure. The company’s V2X chipsets offer production-ready standalone solutions that are purpose-built for global applications, resulting in direct communication becoming more pervasive.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend for QCOM Earnings estimates for Qualcomm for fiscal 2026 have moved down 1.4% to $12.15 over the past year, while the same for fiscal 2026 has declined 2.1% to $12.58. The downward estimate revision depicts that investors are bearish about the growth potential for the stock.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEnd Note With robust automotive and Snapdragon traction, Qualcomm appears to be relatively better placed in terms of its portfolio strength. A strong emphasis on quality, diligent execution of operational plans and continuous portfolio enhancements are driving more value for customers. With downward earnings estimate revisions, the stock is witnessing negative investor sentiment.\n\nMoreover, stiff competition and softness in key end markets are likely to put pressure on the bottom-line growth. High R&D costs erode its profitability to a large extent. Qualcomm is facing a tough operating environment in China amid escalating tariffs, raising questions about its long-term viability plans in the communist country. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Qualcomm appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

      "Title": "Tesla EV Deliveries Slide in 2025: Time to Sell TSLA Stock?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-ev-deliveries-slide-2025-153400572.html",
      "Content": "BYDDF\n\nBYDDY\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla TSLA saw its annual deliveries decline for the second consecutive year in 2025. After deliveries declined in the first and second quarters of 2025, Tesla set a new delivery record in the third quarter, but much of it came from buyers rushing to claim the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit. Expiration of incentives, intense competition from Chinese EV makers, particularly BYD Co Ltd BYDDY, and an aging fleet resulted in the year-over-year decline in Tesla deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as the full year.\n\nWhile TSLA’s core EV business is struggling, CEO Elon Musk is pinning big hopes on autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, considering those as the next fuel engines for the company. However, meaningful revenues from these projects are years away.\nSo, in this scenario, should investors dump Tesla stock or still hold it tight on big long-term promises? Before that, let's dig deeper into TSLA’s latest delivery numbers.\nTSLA Q4 & Full-Year Deliveries Disappoint In the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla sold 418,227 vehicles (comprising 406,585 Model 3/Y and 11,642 other models), down 16% from the corresponding quarter of 2024. For the full year, deliveries totaled roughly 1.64 million vehicles (comprising 1.58 million units of Model 3/Y and 50,850 other models). That denotes a decline from nearly 1.8 million vehicles sold in 2024.\n\nAnother thing to be noticed here is that the rate of sales decline has also increased in 2025. In 2024, deliveries were down 1% on a year-over-year basis. In 2025, the year-over-year decline was more than 8%.\nAnd with that, Tesla lost its EV crown to BYD, which overthrew Tesla for the first time on an annual basis. BYD logged record sales of 2.26 million BEVs in 2025, reflecting a 28% increase year over year.\nMusk’s Pivot to Robotaxis & Robotics Musk is betting big on Full Self-Driving (FSD) and robotaxis, calling them Tesla’s most valuable future segment. Its robotaxi service, launched in June, is currently operational in Austin and San Francisco, with Phoenix next after the company recently secured the required permits. Tesla has also outlined plans to expand into Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston and Miami. Notably, Tesla’s FSD fleet has surpassed 7 billion total miles.\nAlso, Tesla has started testing driverless robotaxis without safety monitors, which investors see as proof of progress toward autonomous mobility. Musk has also announced that Tesla’s in-car systems will integrate Grok, an AI chatbot, boosting confidence in Tesla’s ability to monetize AI.\n\nStory Continues\nThat said, competition in autonomy remains intense. Alphabet ’s GOOGL Waymo continues to lead the autonomous ride-hailing race. Its entire fleet operates without safety drivers, and it recently surpassed 450,000 weekly paid rides. So, Tesla is still playing catch-up in the AV space.\nRegarding robotics, Tesla’s humanoid robot project, Optimus, is seen as a long-term growth driver, adding to the narrative that Tesla is more than just an EV company.\n\nFlourishing Energy Business One key bright spot for the company is its Energy Generation and Storage business, which is going strong on the back of the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products. This segment also stands out as Tesla's most lucrative, boasting the highest margins. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed a record 14.2 GWh of energy storage products. For the full year, deployments rose 48.7% to 46.7 GWh.\n\nTSLA’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Over the past year, Tesla shares have underperformed the industry.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company trades at more than 13.75X forward 12-month sales, far above the industry average. But Tesla has been one of those stocks whose valuation has long been divorced from its fundamentals. It has always traded at a premium, backed by promises of its long-term potential.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s 2025 revenues and EPS implies a year-over-year contraction of 3% and 33%, respectively. But the consensus mark for 2026 top and bottom lines suggests an improvement of 11.6% and 42.4%, respectively, from the 2025 projected levels. See how TSLA’s EPS estimates have been revised over the past 90 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla Shares Worth Holding Onto Now Tesla’s delivery slowdown highlights the growing pressure on its core EV business. But Tesla is not just an EV story now. While vehicle demand faces competition and incentive-related volatility, the company continues to make steady progress in full self-driving, robotaxis, and energy storage—areas that could reshape its long-term earnings mix. At the same time, ambitions around AI and humanoid robotics offer optionality that a few automakers can match, even if monetization remains years away.\n\nThat said, investors should temper expectations. Scaling robotaxis beyond pilot programs and turning AI-led projects into consistent revenue streams will take time.\nFor now, Tesla is a high-risk, high-reward stock. Long-term believers should stay invested, but fresh entry points may warrant patience. And if even part of Musk’s vision comes together, TSLA could remain a winning stock for years to come.\nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "TFC\n\nIntel’s fair value estimate has inched up from about US$37.27 to about US$38.14 per share, with a slightly higher discount rate of about 11.53% now applied to a modestly improved revenue growth outlook of about 5.60%. This reflects research that reads as cautiously optimistic, with cleaner recent quarters, better demand signals, and early foundry progress prompting analysts to lift their models while still openly flagging execution risks and an uncertain recovery path. Stay tuned as we unpack what is driving these model tweaks today and how you can keep on top of the evolving Intel narrative from here.\n\nStay updated as the Fair Value for Intel shifts by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\nWhat Wall Street Has Been Saying 🐂 Bullish Takeaways\nSeveral firms see Intel making tangible progress on execution, with Truist and TD Cowen both pointing to cleaner quarterly results, clearer AI messaging, better demand signals, and improving foundry datapoints as reasons to lift their models.\nTruist raised its price target to US$39 from US$21 and TD Cowen moved to US$38 from US$35, framing Intel as delivering positive updates while still treating the recovery as a work in progress rather than a completed turnaround.\nMorgan Stanley increased its price target to US$36 from US$23 after adjusting its revenue and non GAAP EPS estimates higher and citing more optimism around the foundry opportunity, even as it keeps an Equal Weight stance.\nWells Fargo highlights intensifying competition in AI accelerators, mentioning Intel alongside Qualcomm, AMD and Nvidia. This keeps Intel in the conversation for data center and AI workloads even if the focus of that particular note is on Qualcomm.\nRaymond James resumes coverage at Market Perform, pointing to a stronger balance sheet and new management as reasons for some confidence. It also describes its sum of the parts work as consistent with a fair value view at current levels.\n\n🐻 Bearish Takeaways\nValuation is a recurring concern, with Raymond James flagging that Intel shares trade well above median historic earnings multiples and that its sum of the parts analysis points to pricing that already reflects a fair value outcome.\nHSBC takes the most cautious stance, downgrading Intel to Reduce from Hold with a higher price target of US$24, and calling the recent share rally overdone after a strong move since a series of government and partner deals.\nHSBC and others keep the focus on execution risk, especially in Intel’s own fabs, arguing that any sustained recovery still depends heavily on how well the company delivers on its manufacturing roadmap and potential technology agreements.\nTD Cowen, despite a higher target, cuts its 2026 estimates materially and highlights gross margin headwinds and Altera deconsolidation as factors that could make it harder for fundamentals to catch up with the stock.\nWedbush, which lifted its target only slightly to US$20 from US$19, explicitly struggles to justify the recent valuation rerating and keeps a Neutral view. This shows that a portion of the Street sees limited upside until Intel’s results build a longer track record of improvement.\n\nStory Continues\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts?

      "Content": "Key Points Apple's Vision Pro headset is selling poorly, according to IDC.\nThis has prompted the company to slash production and marketing spending.\nApple's search for a post-iPhone blockbuster continues.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\nWhen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) launched the first iteration of its Vision Pro headset in early 2024, the tech giant declared that \"the era of spatial computing is here.\" Nearly two years later, it's become clear that Apple badly misjudged demand for its heavy, expensive headset.\nThe Financial Times recently reported that Apple has been cutting Vision Pro production and marketing in response to weak sales. Apple doesn't report Vision Pro sales figures, but IDC expects the company to ship just 45,000 Vision Pro units in the final quarter of 2025. Even with a $3,499 price tag, revenue from the Vision Pro is immaterial for Apple if IDC's estimates are accurate.\n\nWhile it's not clear whether Apple is entirely giving up on the Vision Pro, the company's long search for a product that can achieve the same success as the iPhone continues.\nThe iPhone is still the king Much of Apple's business is tied to the iPhone. In fiscal 2025, a bit more than half of Apple's total revenue came from iPhone sales, which totaled $201 billion. Wearables and other accessories churned up $37 billion in revenue, but the popular Apple Watch requires an iPhone for full functionality.\n\nServices is Apple's second-largest segment, with revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2025. However, much of that revenue is at least somewhat dependent on the iPhone as well. A deal with Alphabet that generates around $20 billion for Apple annually, making Google the default search engine on Apple devices, doesn't exist without the iPhone. Neither does all the revenue Apple generates from the App Store or any other services that are deeply integrated with Apple's devices.\nThe iPhone remains a juggernaut, but there will eventually come a day when the smartphone will be supplanted by something new. It may be some sort of augmented reality glasses, or potentially a new hardware form that hasn't yet been invented. The Vision Pro certainly isn't it.\n\nApple is starting to look like a classic case of The Innovator's Dilemma , a phrase coined by Clayton Chirstenson decades ago. Apple is heavily dependent on the iPhone, and nearly everything it does ultimately attempts to protect that product. Even the Vision Pro needs an iPhone for some features, including making calls.\nThis makes sense in the near term, given the profitability of the iPhone. However, it also means that Apple is unlikely to be the company that develops the next big thing. For that, Apple would need to disrupt itself and the iPhone, and there's no reason to believe the company is willing to take enough risk for that to happen.\n\nStory Continues\nApple stock is looking pricey Apple is valued at around $4 trillion, which translates to a price-to-earnings ratio based on the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2026 of roughly 33. Sales growth is expected to be in the single-digit percentage range this year and next, while earnings-per-share growth is likely to receive a boost from share buybacks.\n\nIs Apple stock attractive at this price? I'd argue that it's not. There's only so much juice to squeeze from the iPhone business, and Apple is no closer today than it was 5 years ago to having a post-iPhone blockbuster product. Apple is risk-averse and unwilling to disrupt the iPhone business in any meaningful way, which may lead to problems down the road.\nApple is an incredible business, but the failure of the Vision Pro is a prime example of the company's ongoing struggle to define a post-iPhone era. With a lofty valuation as well, Apple stock doesn't look great to me as a long-term investment.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?

Its global market share last year was 20%, while Apple’s was 16%. Samsung phones run Alphabet’s Android operating system. Android has a smartphone market share of 77%, and iOS makes up almost all the rest.\nRecently, Samsung said it would release 800 million AI-powered mobile devices this year. Google’s Gemini will power these “Galaxy AI” devices. Reuters reports, “The plan by the world's largest backer of Google's Android mobile platform is set to give a major boost to its developer Google, which is locked in a race with OpenAI and others to attract more consumer users to their AI model.” It is also a direct shot at Apple and the huge Chinese smartphone companies that sell most of their products in their home market. China is by far the largest smartphone market. Its smartphone count may be as high as a billion units.\n\nSamsung’s new Galaxy AI is only a part of its effort to take share from Apple. The other primary piece is its foldable phones, which have not yet gained popularity in the United States.\nAI use on smartphones is in its early days. So, Samsung cannot say for certain how much in unit sales it will take from Apple. However, this may be its best chance in the short term.\nApple’s stock price continues to rely primarily on the strength of iPhone sales. If Samsung’s effort succeeds, that share support weakens.\nApple Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

The company is trading at a premium, as suggested by the value score of D. Given MRVL’s premium valuation, investors might be wondering: Is this an opportunity to buy, or are there deeper challenges that could keep the stock in check?\n\nMRVL Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAI Race Among Global Corporations Driving MRVL Marvell Technology is gaining from the AI wave, which has built a strong demand for both custom silicon and interconnect semiconductor products. Products like AI XPU, digital signal processors (DSP), data center interconnect switches, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and Active Electrical Cable play a crucial role in supporting hyperscalers, data centers and AI factories, hence driving their demand.\n\nMarvell Technology expects its custom silicon business to roughly contribute to one-fourth of its overall data center revenues and grow at least 20% next year. The company recently unveiled 18 XPU and XPU-attach socket design wins, among which many are already in volume production. In the connectivity space, the volume shipments of MRVL’s next-generation 200G per lane 1.6T PAM DSPs are also a tailwind.\nMarvell Technology’s data center segment has experienced rapid growth in the past seven quarters. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, Marvell Technology’s data center segment posted revenues of $1.52 billion, up 37.8% year over year, led by strong traction in custom XPU silicon, electro-optic interconnect products and next-generation switches. As the hyperscalers are expanding AI clusters rapidly, the use of high-bandwidth interconnects, custom ASICs, PAM4/800G, and DCI is rising.\n\nMarvell Technology’s Ara 200G/lambda 1.6T PAM4 optical DSP for AI scale-out is another product that improves AI networking. Furthermore, Marvell Technology’s Teralynx switch telemetry API is a software layer integrated into MRVL’s Teralynx switching platform, providing real-time visibility and analytics into network traffic, latency, and congestion, allowing operators to monitor performance and optimize AI infrastructure efficiency across data centers.\nMRVL Gains From Acquisitions and Partnerships Marvell Technology recently announced the acquisition of Celestial AI, which will speed up its momentum in the interconnect space as AI clusters grow more complex. Celestial AI’s high-performance photonic compute interconnect IP will position Marvell Technology at the heart of next-generation AI data center architectures.\n\nStory Continues\nMarvell Technology has also partnered with industry leaders, including Amazon ’s AMZN Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and NVIDIA NVDA. Marvell Technology has a multi-year strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services to supply connectivity products for AI and data-center workloads.\nMarvell Technology has also partnered with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion technology into MRVL’s custom cloud-platform silicon solution. These partnerships with Amazon and NVIDIA have opened gates for MRVL among hyperscalers and cloud providers, all the while benefiting from top AI technologies.\n\nHow MRVL Is Outperforming Its Rivals The rapid growth of AI workload and allied infrastructure has attracted multiple players in this space. Semiconductor giants, including Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices AMD in the AI accelerator market and Micron Technology in the HBM space, operate alongside Marvell Technology, giving it healthy competition. Advanced Micro Devices is a strong player in the custom silicon solutions and AI accelerator space with its semi-custom SoC offerings powering numerous data centers.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices’ reconfigurable Alveo Adaptable Accelerator Cards are used to speed up compute-intensive applications in data centers. Broadcom’s advanced 3.5D XDSiP packaging platform is specifically designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of custom AI XPUs for AI accelerators. Micron Technology has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with MU’s HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.\nHowever, MRVL’s rapid expansion of its portfolio has helped it keep pace with the market trend. Marvell Technology is constantly deepening its expertise in the AI space. MRVL is developing a co-packaged copper system with 2.5m direct attach cable and a Co-packaged optics switch system, which will enable companies to use high-speed networking to accelerate memory-intensive AI workloads. MRVL has Structera CXL and Alaska P PCIe 6 retimer over cable for AI scale-up while maintaining signal integrity.\nThese factors are contributing to MRVL’s top-line and bottom-line growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 revenues and earnings show a growth rate of 42% and 81%, respectively. MRVL’s fiscal 2026 earnings have been revised upward in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMRVL’s 200-Day and 50-Day SMA Suggest Bullish Trend SMCI’s shares are trading above the 200-day and 50-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Buy MRVL Stock Now Marvell Technology has strong long-term fundamentals supported by its strong foothold in the data center, deep AI portfolio and high-speed networking space. Furthermore, the company has strong partnerships with industry leaders in hyperscale, AI and semiconductor space, making MRVL an indispensable link in the AI chain.\n\nConsidering all these factors, we suggest that investors should buy this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock at present.

      "Content": "Tesla shares rise after Trump praises Musk but Optimus robot challenges remain\n\nLouis Juricic\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 5:23 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nInvesting.com -- Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were in focus Monday as investors digested weekend developments including President Donald Trump’s comments about CEO Elon Musk and updates on the company’s ambitious Optimus robot project. Shares rose 1.8% in premarket.\nTrump praised Musk during comments to reporters aboard Air Force One, calling him \"great\" and \"well-meaning,\" while describing the Tesla CEO as \"80% supergenius and 20% he makes mistakes.\" Musk reciprocated on X, noting he \"had a lovely dinner last night with @POTUS and @FLOTUS\" and declaring \"2026 is going to be amazing!\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal published a detailed report on Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot project, which Musk has positioned as potentially \"the biggest product of all time\" with the ability to generate \"infinite\" revenue for the company. Musk’s new compensation package gives him 10 years to transform Tesla into an $8.5 trillion company and sell at least one million robots, which could earn him a $1 trillion pay package.\nDespite the ambitious vision, the Optimus project faces significant technical challenges. The robots are currently hand-made, with engineers struggling to create hands with both the sensitivity and dexterity of humans. In public demonstrations, the robots are often remotely operated by human engineers wearing body suits and virtual-reality headsets.\n\nSome Tesla employees have questioned the usefulness of the humanoid robots for routine manufacturing operations, suggesting purpose-built robots might be more effective for specific factory tasks. Robotics experts note that giving robots enough dexterity and environmental awareness to perform useful tasks remains a frontier challenge.\nTesla has already backed away from its initial timeline of deploying commercial versions of Optimus in its factories by the end of this year. The company is currently working on the third generation of the robot.\nThis robot initiative comes as Tesla’s core automotive business faces headwinds. The company reported vehicle sales fell 16% in the fourth quarter and dropped 9% for all of 2025, causing Tesla to lose its global EV sales crown to China’s BYD. Tesla’s stock, which tumbled in early 2025 amid slumping EV sales, had rebounded in recent months on optimism about Musk’s pivot to robotaxis and humanoid robots.\nRelated articles\nTesla shares rise after Trump praises Musk but Optimus robot challenges remain\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nGold: $4K Breakout Faces First Real Test as Stocks and Sentiment Rise Together\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla China Shipments Fall in 2025 Despite December Uptick\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 5:12 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nRecent data from China suggest Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) is navigating a more challenging operating backdrop in one of its most important markets. Preliminary figures from the China Passenger Car Association indicate the company shipped 851,732 vehicles from its Shanghai factory in 2025, representing about a 7% decline from the prior year, despite a pickup toward year-end. December shipments reached 97,171 vehicles, marking only the fourth month in 2025 to show year-on-year growth, with the majority of output believed to be absorbed by the domestic market, although export details were not specified.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe softer China performance appears to reflect broader pressures on Tesla's global business. The company has reported a second consecutive annual decline in overall deliveries and lost its position as the world's largest electric-vehicle maker to BYD ( BYDDF ). While third-quarter deliveries benefited from US customers accelerating purchases ahead of changes to subsidy policies, demand momentum has remained uneven as government support is gradually reduced across several regions. At the same time, reports note that consumer sentiment could still be weighing on demand, even after Elon Musk stepped back from a more visible role in politics.\nCompetitive dynamics in China continue to intensify, particularly as domestic players introduce increasingly technology-focused models. Xiaomi's YU7 sport utility vehicle has emerged as a close competitor to Tesla's Model Y, with November sales of 33,591 units compared with 33,935 units for Tesla's model, according to industry data. Despite these pressures on individual manufacturers, China's broader new-energy vehicle market continued to expand, with December NEV wholesales rising 4% year on year to 1.57 million units and full-year NEV sales increasing by about 25%, based on Bloomberg calculations using association data.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "ANET\n\nASML\n\nCOIN\n\nIBM\n\nQuick Read Wall Street will be back at full speed as traders and investors return from the Christmas and New Year holidays.\nMany on Wall Street are expecting an increase in volatility after a third straight year of double-digit gains for the S&P 500.\nWhile the AI and Data Center trade will remain in focus in 2026, expect the outsized gains of the last few years to taper off somewhat over the next 12 months.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nPre-Market Stock Futures: Futures are mainly trading higher as we start the first full week of trading in 2026. Investors and traders who were missing in action due to the Christmas and New Year's holiday are returning to a stock market that, for the third consecutive year, did not experience a \"Santa Claus rally,\" which refers to stocks trading higher the final five trading sessions of each year and the first two of the following year. With Santa Claus safely back at the North Pole, and Wall Street back to full speed this week, many top analysts are expecting heightened volatility this year after the third consecutive year of double-digit gains for the venerable S&P 500 which rose on the first trading day of 2026, closing last Friday at 6,858, up 0.19%, while the Nasdaq closed slightly lower at 23,235. The Dow Jones Industrials burst out of the gate, closing up 0.66% to finish the session at 48,382.\n\nTreasury Bonds: Sellers took the stage on Friday as yields across the Treasury curve finished the day higher. While some buyers were in the T-bill maturities, the longer-dated bonds ended the day lower. The 30-year bond closed at 4.87%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last quoted at 4.20%, down from 4.80% this time last year, and the first annual decline in yield in five years. Traders are waiting for a flood of economic data, and not expecting another rate cut until perhaps the summer, so yields could drift higher in the near term.\n\nOil and Gas: Prices were modestly lower across the energy complex on Friday, with Brent Crude down 0.16% at $60.75 and West Texas Intermediate closing the session at $57.32, down 0.17%. Oil prices hit five-year lows in 2025, and many expect WTI to trade in the $55- $60 range this year. The weekend capture of Venezuelan President Maduro and his wife may inject some volatility into the picture this week. His capture comes almost to the day, 36 years ago, since the U.S captured Panama's dictator, Manuel Noriega, for similar narco-terror and drug trafficking-related charges. Natural gas was the biggest loser on Friday, closing down 1.8% to $3.62. The sell-off comes as it was announced that U.S. LNG production broke a record, shipping 100 million tons in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nGold: Gold started the year the same way it ended 2025, closing modestly higher Friday at $4,330 after a stellar year that saw the precious metal soar 64%, while Silver, which ended Friday at $72.62, was up an astounding 147% last year, and Platinum saw a massive 125% gain in 2025. The Data Center buildouts and China's EV boom helped push other industrial commodities higher over the last year as well. Many expect Gold to reach $ 5,000 by the end of the year.\n\nCrypto: The crypto market rallied strongly on Friday, driven by gains across altcoins and memecoins. This represented a positive start to the year, after some very volatile sessions in December that saw big price swings across the major coins. At 8A EST, Bitcoin traded at $92,777, while Ethereum was quoted at $3,167.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.\nHere are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Monday, January 5, 2026.\n\nUpgrades: Arista Networks Inc.

      "Content": "At US$36.87, Is GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) Worth Looking At Closely?\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:52 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GFS\n\nGlobalFoundries Inc. ( NASDAQ:GFS ) saw a decent share price growth of 14% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine GlobalFoundries’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhat Is GlobalFoundries Worth? According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 23%, trading at US$36.87 compared to our intrinsic value of $29.86. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that GlobalFoundries’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for GlobalFoundries\nWhat does the future of GlobalFoundries look like? Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. GlobalFoundries' revenue growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. Unless expenses grow at the same level, or higher, this top-line growth should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? GFS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe GFS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GFS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for GFS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory Continues\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for GlobalFoundries from their most recent forecasts.

      "Content": "Will NVDA's Blackwell Platform Support Its Data Center Revenue Growth?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation ’s NVDA Blackwell platform is becoming a key driver of its Data Center revenue growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the Data Center segment generated $51.22 billion in revenues, representing 89.8% of total sales. This marked a staggering 66% year-over-year increase and 25% sequential growth.\n\nThe ongoing ramp-up of the Blackwell architecture is central to NVIDIA’s Data Center business growth. The GB300 systems, which offer higher performance and improved energy efficiency compared to the previous Hopper generation, are now shipping in large volumes.\nCustomers are using these systems to support complex artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, from large language models to real-time inference. NVIDIA’s full-stack approach, which combines graphics processing units (GPUs), networking and software, continues to make it the preferred partner for large-scale AI projects.\nThe near-term outlook still appears solid, with the company expecting further strength from Blackwell shipments and expanding orders across cloud, sovereign AI and enterprise AI projects. NVIDIA also sees the growing adoption of agentic AI, long-context workloads and advanced inference systems, all of which depend on high-performance GPU clusters, as key catalysts for long-term growth.\n\nThe growing demand for the company’s AI chips used in data centers is likely to continue aiding its Data Center business performance. Our model estimate for fiscal 2026 Data Center revenues is currently pegged at $190 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 65%.\nNVIDIA’s Competitors in the AI Data Center Space Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC are two major companies that are competing closely with NVIDIA in the AI data center space.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is gaining traction with its MI300 series accelerators, which are designed to handle training and inference for large AI models. AMD’s chips have attracted interest from major cloud providers seeking diversification beyond NVIDIA’s ecosystem. While Advanced Micro Devices’ software stack is still developing, its performance and pricing advantages make it a credible alternative.\n\nIntel is also reasserting its presence with the Gaudi series of AI accelerators. The company is positioning Gaudi3 as a cost-effective and scalable option for AI data centers, targeting enterprise clients looking for flexibility. Intel’s broad reach in CPUs and server infrastructure helps it integrate AI solutions more easily into existing systems.\nNVIDIA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 19.3% over the past six months compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s gain of 17.6%.\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA 6-Month Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, NVDA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26.8, lower than the industry’s average of 28.97.\nNVIDIA Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies a year-over-year increase of approximately 55.9% and 55.2%, respectively.

( NYSE:TSM ) shares advanced by the most since April, reaching a new record in Taipei as optimism around artificial intelligence demand carried into the start of the year. The world's largest contract chipmaker rose as much as 6.9% after Goldman Sachs lifted its price target by 35% to NT$2,330, reflecting expectations for another year of solid growth. The move underscored TSMC's importance as a key supplier to Nvidia and Apple, while helping lift Taiwan's Taiex more than 3% to a record above 30,000, a level officials said recently had appeared difficult to envision.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with PEP.\nIs TSM fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nStrength in TSMC fed into a broader rally across Asian semiconductor stocks as investors continued to add exposure to the AI theme, even as some concerns about overheating and short-term volatility lingered following recent US strikes against Venezuela. Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) extended gains for a fifth consecutive session ahead of preliminary results expected later in the week, which are likely to offer fresh insight into whether earnings can support recent share-price momentum. In Japan, Tokyo Electron and Advantest each climbed more than 7%, while Chinese chip stocks moved higher after the country's integrated circuit investment fund increased its stake in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and as attention grew around more efficient AI training approaches highlighted by DeepSeek.\n\nInvestor confidence in TSMC's position within the AI supply chain has continued to build, with the shares up 44% in 2025 and the company's market value rising above $1 trillion for the first time. Goldman analysts described AI as a multi-year growth engine for the company, pointing to improving profit margins even as projected capital spending could reach $150 billion over the next three years to expand capacity. Other analysts have suggested this year remains heavily centered on AI, while encouraging investors to focus on quality amid bubble concerns, with near-term attention also on TSMC's Jan. 15 earnings report and a wave of planned Hong Kong listings by AI-related companies that could raise as much as $4.1 billion.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "台積電今（5）日股價強勢噴出，盤中一度大漲110元、最高衝上1695元，終場收在1670元，盤中與收盤雙雙寫下歷史新高。台積電ADR在上周五瘋漲5.17%之後，周一盤前續飆逾3%。就在台積電市值與股價齊創紀錄之際，市場也再度回頭檢視「股神」巴菲特當年提前出清台積電的投資決定。若未因地緣政治退場，波克夏海瑟威如今帳面價值，恐已多出近新台幣4700億元。\n\n從重押到全數出清\n\n波克夏是在2022年第3季首次進場買進台積電ADR。根據波克夏當年公布的持股變動，在2022年7月至9月期間，巴菲特首度買進約6010萬單位台積電ADR，投入金額超過41億美元。由於波克夏過去鮮少大舉投資科技產業，這項布局一度被市場解讀為巴菲特對台積電的高度肯定，也帶動台積電ADR曾單日大漲約7%。\n\n儘管巴菲特有句投資名言：如果一檔股票，你不打算持有10年，那就連10分鐘都不要持有，但是他對台積電的這筆投資卻並未長期持有。2023年2月中，波克夏公告大幅減碼台積電ADR，持股從原本約6006萬單位，降至829.27萬單位，減持幅度高達86%，持有市值也縮水至6億多美元。同年5月，波克夏進一步申報，已全數出清台積電ADR，正式結束這段投資。\n\n「地緣政治」成出清主因\n\n巴菲特曾在2023年5月的波克夏年會上親自說明賣出台積電的原因。他表示，台積電是一家「了不起的公司」，也是全球管理得最好、在晶片產業中極為關鍵的企業之一，幾乎無人能與之相比。然而，他同時點出，台積電最大的問題在於地點，隨著兩岸情勢與地緣政治風險升高，全球決策者與客戶對於過度依賴台灣的疑慮持續加深，這正是波克夏選擇出清的關鍵考量。\n\n當年波克夏快速進出，也一度對市場造成衝擊。在2022年第4季減持86%的消息曝光後，台積電ADR曾於短時間內下跌約5%，引發市場震盪，台灣投資人更掀起對巴菲特「長期持有」投資哲學的熱烈討論。\n\n股價翻倍後回頭看 代價浮現\n\n不過，隨著時間推移，市場走勢出現戲劇性轉折。自波克夏於2023年第1季全數出清後，台積電ADR股價卻一路走高，從4月初約84美元，攀升至上周五收盤的319.61美元新高，漲幅約280%。\n\n若以當初波克夏持有的6010萬單位ADR估算，原本約41億美元的市值，如今已膨脹至接近192億美元，等同翻了約4.7倍。換言之，波克夏因提前出清，錯失約151億美元的潛在帳面價值，折合新台幣約4700億元。\n\n在台積電現股與ADR同步創高之際，這段投資歷程也被市場重新檢視。從高度肯定企業競爭力，到因地緣政治風險選擇退場，巴菲特的決策，成為投資人思考「風險評估」與「長期價值」取捨時，一個極具代表性的案例。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導每10輛就有1輛！陸車在歐洲大國賣爆了 比亞迪超車特斯拉奪全球電車霸主全職媽咬牙補繳10萬國民年金！內行試算兩年就回本「是失業懲罰金還是救命錢？」看完這3點風向全變了鴻海大啖AI新肥單？又傳OpenAI硬體快問世",

      "Content": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Bull, Base and Bear Price Prediction and Forecast\n\nJoel South\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:15 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nQuick Read Tesla remains the leader of the EV revolution, dominating global market share despite the stock’s recent struggles.\nThe company faces numerous headwinds, which could ultimately impact its long-term performance.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) lost 9.68% over the past five trading sessions after losing 2.59% the five prior. A rally that began in early summer 2025 has pushed the stock into the green on the year, but the AI-induced sell-off that began in late October 2025 and carried through the end of the year has tempered Tesla's performance. Over the past year, the stock is up 6.57%.\nWhen the company reported Q3 earnings on Oct. 22, 2025, it announced quarterly revenue of $28.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year (YoY). However, earnings of 50 cents per share missed analysts' estimates of 54 cents per share. Concerningly, quarterly net income fell 37% YoY to $1.37 billion.\nTesla's stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk's role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk's friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla's outlook remains clouded.\n\nIn any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let's check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it's a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term.\nTesla's Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along Tesla's latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla's most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we'll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully.\n\nStory Continues\nUndoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it's one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas' view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied \"AI ETF\" given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes.\n\nThough Tesla's AI efforts are exciting, it's important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it's to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla's been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories?\nThe most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there's also the rumored \"Model Q\" entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a \"wild card.\"\n\nBull Case for Tesla's Share Price Cybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla's robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk's vision of the robotaxi future could be a reality within Trump's term. Of course, a more realistic timeframe would put such a future more than 10 years out.\n\nHowever, if Tesla can floor it on full self-driving (FSD) efforts, perhaps such a future could be closer to the present. There's a great deal of uncertainty with FSD, given the technical and regulatory unknowns. Either way, I view Musk's friendship with Trump as a boon for a Cybertruck rollout under his administration.\nIf Cybertruck expands its presence and becomes a hit within years rather than decades, TSLA stock could prove a bargain, given all that there is to gain. The big question, though, is how Cybercab will hold its own as Waymo pushes ahead with its impressive offering. Given robotaxis, like generative AI, are unlikely to be a \"winner takes all\" market, I think there's no reason why both robotaxi offerings can't win big from prime-time adoption of self-driving.\n\nAnother big question to consider is whether consumers will be interested in buying up Cybercabs to have them rolling around on the streets as ride-hailers. I think the business could prove quite lucrative for buyers and Tesla's margins over the long haul. After all, it can sell the car and continue to build a ride-hailing network while profiting from use of a ride-hailing app of sorts.\nCathie Wood thinks autonomous ride-hailing could represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. If Tesla can get a nice slice, Wood sees TSLA stock at $2,600 per share by 2029. Personally, I think the bull case (for the year ahead) could see TSLA at around $550 per share — or 33.67% higher than where the stock is trading today. That target is shared by Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, one of my favorite analysts in tech.\n\nOptimus: Optimus was a nice addition to the robotaxis event as it amused attendees. But the big question is how much potential the robot has once it's ready to go on sale to the general public.\nUndoubtedly, Tesla isn't the only one getting into the robotics game. Many Mag Seven members also investing heavily in home robots. While more rivals in home robots could be a threat to Optimus, I view it as more of a confirmation that there is a place in the home for such profound innovations.\nAs for the home robotics market, I do see 2026 as a tad overly optimistic for a launch. However, if robot \"friends\" do arrive by 2030, I think Tesla's growth rate could reaccelerate back to or even above 25% to 30% for some amount of time.\n\nAnalysts' Price Targets: So far this fall and during summer, the EV firm underwent a series of price target revisions from analysts. Stifel raised its price target on Tesla to $483 from $440 keeping its \"Buy\" rating while citing progress in its Robotaxi network. Canaccord raised its price target on Tesla to $490 from $333 keeping its \"Buy\" rating. In September, Mizuho raised its price target on Tesla to $450 from $375 while keeping an \"Outperform\" rating. In July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285 while maintaining a \"Neutral\" rating. Benchmark raised its price target on TSLA to $475 from $350 while maintaining a \"Buy\" rating following the successful launch of Tesla's robotaxi business in Austin. UBS raised its price target on TSLA to $215 from $190 but maintained its \"Sell\" rating.\n\nBear Case for Tesla's Share Price Falling Deliverables: Tesla reported 418,227 deliveries in Q4 2025 and 1,636,129 for 2025. Year over year, those figures are down 16% and 9%, respectively. Tesla was affected by the expiration of the U.S. electric vehicle tax credit in 2025 as well as increased competition in Europe. Morningstar forecasts that deliveries will continue to decrease through the first three quarters of 2026.\n\nCybertruck: Undoubtedly, there's still a lot of work to do before Cybertruck makes an impact on the car market. FSD capabilities need to step things up and the vehicle needs to be made in a way that won't break the bank. These are big asks. Some bears have doubts about whether the firm can execute the opportunity. In late March, the company announced that it was recalling nearly every Cybertruck due to a potential crash risk. This was an enormous blow to Musk's ambitions for the EV, which has already been subjected to harsh criticism about its perceived shortcomings among owners.\nBad Press: Musk's deteriorated image at the hands of his federal government involvement with DOGE aside, Tesla has continued to bear the brunt of bad news. It has been widely reported that the EV maker was the most dangerous vehicle brand, with the number of deaths among all automakers, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. According to the study, Tesla has a fatal accident rate of 5.6 per billion vehicle miles, compared to the overall average of just 2.8. Additionally, ongoing protests against the brand — including vandalism and arson — have occurred around the globe, from Italy and France to numerous states in the U.S.\n\nOptimus: Even if home robots are on the horizon, good luck asking consumers to spend thousands on a proven technology. Indeed, if Vision Pro taught us anything, it's that being an early adopter is expensive and probably not the best use of funds. Either way, I'd much rather wait and see how the robot ambitions pan out before getting too excited at this stage.\nInsider & Institutional Activity: There's an old adage on Wall Street that suggests investors should \"follow the money.\" Over the past 12 months, institutional ownership has decreased to 47.64%. In total, 116 institutional investors have entirely liquidated their Tesla positions over the past year.\nIncreased competition: In April 2025, a Jeff Bezos-backed EV company called Slate unveiled affordable EV truck and SUV models, which the company aims to sell at a cost of around $30,000. The company has billed itself as the \"anti-Tesla,\" and is made in the U.S. As Tesla's market share has fallen under 50% in EV-friendly California, the arrival of Slate could continue to erode sales.\n\nBase Case for Tesla's Share Price The base case for Tesla lies somewhere in between the two extremes. Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $395.89, or 9.62% potential downside from today's price. Meanwhile, the high-end target is $600 and the low-end target is $19.05. I'm inclined to view the $300 level as a fair-value level for the stock.\n\nMuch of Tesla's story depends on its big growth drivers. In the meantime, EV sales and the rise of more affordable models (Model Q) could be nearer-term stories to look forward to as one waits for the biggest of drivers to pay off. At the time of writing, TSLA stock goes for 210.31 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and an 15.20 price-to-sales (P/S). That makes the name slightly undervalued, at least in my view.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Analyst Report: Alphabet Inc\n\nJoseph Bonner, CFA\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:12 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAlphabet, formerly called Google, maintains the largest online index of websites accessible through automated search technology. It generates revenue through online advertising, cloud services, and hardware. Google is now an operating segment of Alphabet. The company was founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page and went public in 2004. Google's AdWords is an auction-based program that lets businesses display ads along with particular search results. Google's AdSense program enables websites in the company's network to serve targeted ads, based on search terms or web content, from AdWords advertisers. Most of the revenue generated through AdSense is shared with network partners. In addition, Alphabet owns YouTube.com, the web-based video site. It has expanded into mobile telephony with its Android smartphone operating system, into cloud services, and most recently, into autonomous driving. About 52% of Alphabet's revenue is generated outside the U.S. On April 3, 2014, Alphabet's new nonvoting class C shares began trading under the ticker GOOG. Alphabet's publicly held class A shares switched to the ticker GOOGL. The effect of the new class C share issuance was a non-economic 2-for-1 stock split. On July 15, 2022, Alphabet executed a 20-for-1 stock split on its Class A, Class B and Class C stock. The stock split had no impact on the economic value of GOOGL shares.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Morgan Picks the Top Internet Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nTipRanks\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:09 AM PST 10 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nDASH\n\nGOOG\n\nThe AI revolution set the tone in 2025 for digital companies and internet stocks alike. What started as experimentation quickly turned into execution, as platforms rolled out AI across ads, search, content, and customer engagement. The impact was immediate, with productivity jumping, costs coming down, and new monetization paths opening up.\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nThat momentum, according to Doug Anmuth, is far from played out. The J.P. Morgan analyst, who’s ranked among the top 2% on Wall Street, believes the internet sector has high potential for investors looking to run with the bulls this year.\n\n“Heading into 2026, we remain constructive on overall digital trends & Internet secular leaders, with AI once again the primary focus across the group. We anticipate our coverage universe will deliver another solid year of revenue growth in 2026, with mega-caps in the low-mid teens Y/Y growth range, with upside potential. However, Operating Income, GAAP EPS, & FCF will be more mixed in 2026, as companies balance revenue growth with key investments, particularly to capitalize on GenAI-related spending,” Anmuth opined.\nFollowing from this, Anmuth has been pointing out his ‘top pick’ internet stocks to buy for 2026, specifically citing Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) , and DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) . TipRanks data show that all three carry Strong Buy ratings on Wall Street, so let’s take a closer look and see what’s driving the enthusiasm across the board.\n\nAlphabet\nThe first JPM pick on the list is Alphabet, a name investors hardly need introduced. The company’s ecosystem spans everything from Search and YouTube to autonomous driving and logistics bets, but the economic engine remains unchanged: Google’s grip on search-driven digital advertising. That core franchise continues to fund both steady growth and Alphabet’s longer-dated AI ambitions.\nIn 3Q25, Google ads generated $74.2 billion of Alphabet’s $102.3 billion in total revenue. At the same time, Google Cloud is becoming a more meaningful contributor, posting $15.16 billion in revenue and growing 33.5% year-over-year, supported by enterprise AI workloads and infrastructure demand.\n\nStory Continues\nThe third quarter marked an important milestone for Alphabet, with the company’s first-ever $100-billion-plus quarter. These strong gains in revenue and earnings have come as the company is making a concerted push to enhance and promote its AI-powered services. The company has rolled out AI improvements to Google Search, in the form of the AI Overviews and the interactive AI Mode. In addition, the company has been integrating its Gemini across multiple products and platforms, making it available as an AI assistant on the Android OS. In addition, last month, Google announced the global launch of Gemini 3 Flash, the latest – and fastest – of its AI models.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the market has taken notice. GOOGL shares surged 65% in 2025, and if analyst Doug Anmuth is right, investors may not be done celebrating just yet.\n“Even after very strong performance… GOOG/L is our top pick into 2026 as we expect AI leadership, full stack strength, data advantages, and global distribution to drive growth acceleration and margin stability. We believe Google can sustain low-mid-teens% Search revenue growth off a large base. AI Search should prove expansionary, driving greater query volumes, improved click quality, and higher prices, offsetting fewer clicks per query. Gemini is once again leading the AI leaderboards, w/Gemini 3.0 faster to deploy across Google and infused within virtually all products. The Gemini App is gaining share with 650M+ MAUs, and we believe robust AI-driven demand will drive acceleration in Cloud growth into the 40’s%+ range,” Anmuth noted.\n\nPutting numbers behind his conviction, Anmuth rates Alphabet shares Overweight (i.e. Buy). His $385 price target implies 22% upside from current levels. (To watch Anmuth’s track record, click here )\nOverall, Wall Street remains broadly constructive on GOOGL, with the stock carrying a Strong Buy consensus rating. Of the 34 analysts covering the name, 27 recommend buying, while 7 sit on the sidelines. However, the Street’s average target of $327.42 suggests just ~4% upside over the next 12 months. Still, as Alphabet has shown time and again, periods of limited upside often give way to upward target revisions as execution and results continue to come through. (See GOOGL stock forecast )\nAmazon\nThe next name on JPM’s list is Amazon – a familiar heavyweight, but one that still rewards a closer look. The scale is firmly in place, with nearly $690 billion in trailing-year revenue, a fortress balance sheet with nearly $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash exiting 3Q25, and a logistics footprint that few global enterprises can realistically replicate. The company is best known, of course, for being the world’s ‘one stop-shop’ online, and for backing that with an unparalleled network of warehouse and delivery assets.\nAI is coming to the fore for Amazon in more concrete ways. In October of last year, Amazon announced that its Project Ranier, in Indiana, is now in use – and is one of the largest AI compute clusters in the world. The project, an $11 billion data center build, features nearly half a million Trainium2 chips, and was deployed less than one year after its plans were first announced. Anthropic, which partners with Amazon on AI ventures, is already running workloads at Project Rainer. The project is an undertaking of AWS, which created the custom-designed Trainium2 chips.\n\nEarly in November, AWS announced a multi-year strategic partnership that empowers OpenAI. The agreement, worth $38 billion over seven years, gives OpenAI access to AWS’s top-notch platform and infrastructure to run world-class AI workloads.\nAll of this underscores both the growth of AWS and its increasing interconnection with Amazon’s AI undertakings. This is also clear from the company’s financial results. In the 3Q25 report, the last released, it showed that AWS revenue came to $33 billion, for 20% year-over-year growth. AWS made up over 18% of Amazon’s total revenue. That total revenue came to $180.2 billion in the third quarter, and was up more than 13% year-over-year while beating the forecast by $2.4 billion. Amazon reported a net income of $21.2 billion, and an EPS of $1.95.\n\nAnmuth, covering Amazon’s stock for JPMorgan, is looking at an upbeat future based on strong gains in the AI businesses. He states, “We remain bullish into 2026 supported by AWS growth acceleration, solid Stores growth & continued share gains, N.America & Int’l OI margin expansion, and solid AWS margins, all of which we believe support FCF doubling to $59B even against AI-driven capex growth. Strong secular growth, workload/tech migrations, & AI contribution/partnerships (including Project Rainier & OpenAI) drive AWS growth acceleration. We project 2026 AWS growth of +23%, vs. +19% in 2025, which could prove conservative… We view valuation as attractive, w/shares trading at ~24x 2027E GAAP EPS & ~31x 2027E FCF.”\nAnmuth rates as Overweight (i.e., Buy), a rating that he complements with a $305 price target that suggests a one-year upside potential of 35%.\nOverall, the 46 recent analyst reviews on AMZN have a lopsided split of 45 Buys to 1 Hold behind their Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently trading at $226.50, and their $295.62 average price target implies an upside of 30.5% by this time next year. (See AMZN stock forecast )\nDoorDash\nThe last of JPM’s ‘top picks’ on our radar is DoorDash, the Silicon Valley company that specializes in food ordering and delivery. DoorDash has been in business since 2013, and today is a $95 billion leader in its field. DoorDash operates across the US and in an additional 30 countries. It connects its customers to their favorite eateries and food suppliers through its online marketplace and commerce platforms.\n\nFor several years now, DoorDash has been working to expand by acquisition. During this past year, the company made two important deals, acquiring the restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion in cash and the British food delivery firm Deliveroo in a $3.9 billion transaction. DoorDash said this past November that it intends to keep up its big spending and outlined ‘several hundred million’ in planned expenses for projects ranging from improvements in global tech stacks to autonomous delivery units.\nDoorDash is already making strides in autonomous delivery. It released its first autonomous robot delivery vehicle, Dot, this past September. Dot is designed to tackle local delivery routes, using sidewalks, bike lanes, and driveways, and it is currently in use in Tempe, Arizona, and Mesa, Arizona, for an early access program. Tempe and Mesa are small cities, and DoorDash has plans to ramp up the robot to larger urban areas.\n\nOn the financial side, we can look at DoorDash’s 3Q25 report. The company listed $3.4 billion in revenue for the period, a figure that was up 27% year-over-year and came $89 million better than forecasts had predicted. DoorDash’s bottom line figure, listed as 55 cents earnings per share, was 13 cents per share below expectations – although it was also up significantly from the 38-cent figure reported in the prior-year quarter. We should note that DoorDash had on hand, at the end of Q3, $7.4 billion in cash and other liquid assets – so its indication of intent to spend ‘several hundred million’ on various improvements and projects may be less worrisome than was first assumed.\nThe JPM take on DASH is laid out, again, by Doug Anmuth. The analyst, who is rated by TipRanks in the top 2% of Wall Street’s analysts, writes of DoorDash’s likely prospects: “We highlight that DASH’s strong performance in the core business over the last several years has been driven by platform investments, and we expect the current wave to also generate substantial ROI over the next few years. While payback on these investments could vary we think concerns around re-platforming execution risk are likely overstated. We also think consensus has layered in the costs from these investments for ‘26 and beyond, however, it likely under-estimating the associated returns. We also expect DASH to invest in Deliveroo and gain share in key markets like the UK & France as the company looks to drive stronger top-line growth and optimize the business for L-T profit dollars.”\n\nSetting out the bottom line, Anmuth adds, “Amidst these incremental investments, we think DASH will continue to see strong trends in the core business, with a focus on selection, quality, affordability and service levels driving better retention as well as order frequency.”\nIn his final assessment, Anmuth puts an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on DASH stock, with a $300 price target that indicates room for a 36% upside on the one-year time frame.\nAll in all, DASH shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating that is backed by 28 analysts’ reviews, including 23 Buys and 5 Holds. With a share price of $219.79 and an average target price of $281.12, DASH has a ~28% upside potential for the coming year.

These strong gains in revenue and earnings have come as the company is making a concerted push to enhance and promote its AI-powered services. The company has rolled out AI improvements to Google Search, in the form of the AI Overviews and the interactive AI Mode. In addition, the company has been integrating its Gemini across multiple products and platforms, making it available as an AI assistant on the Android OS. In addition, last month, Google announced the global launch of Gemini 3 Flash, the latest – and fastest – of its AI models.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the market has taken notice. GOOGL shares surged 65% in 2025, and if analyst Doug Anmuth is right, investors may not be done celebrating just yet.\n“Even after very strong performance… GOOG/L is our top pick into 2026 as we expect AI leadership, full stack strength, data advantages, and global distribution to drive growth acceleration and margin stability. We believe Google can sustain low-mid-teens% Search revenue growth off a large base. AI Search should prove expansionary, driving greater query volumes, improved click quality, and higher prices, offsetting fewer clicks per query. Gemini is once again leading the AI leaderboards, w/Gemini 3.0 faster to deploy across Google and infused within virtually all products. The Gemini App is gaining share with 650M+ MAUs, and we believe robust AI-driven demand will drive acceleration in Cloud growth into the 40’s%+ range,” Anmuth noted.\n\nPutting numbers behind his conviction, Anmuth rates Alphabet shares Overweight (i.e. Buy). His $385 price target implies 22% upside from current levels. (To watch Anmuth’s track record, click here )\nOverall, Wall Street remains broadly constructive on GOOGL, with the stock carrying a Strong Buy consensus rating. Of the 34 analysts covering the name, 27 recommend buying, while 7 sit on the sidelines. However, the Street’s average target of $327.42 suggests just ~4% upside over the next 12 months. Still, as Alphabet has shown time and again, periods of limited upside often give way to upward target revisions as execution and results continue to come through. (See GOOGL stock forecast )\nAmazon\nThe next name on JPM’s list is Amazon – a familiar heavyweight, but one that still rewards a closer look. The scale is firmly in place, with nearly $690 billion in trailing-year revenue, a fortress balance sheet with nearly $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash exiting 3Q25, and a logistics footprint that few global enterprises can realistically replicate. The company is best known, of course, for being the world’s ‘one stop-shop’ online, and for backing that with an unparalleled network of warehouse and delivery assets.\nAI is coming to the fore for Amazon in more concrete ways. In October of last year, Amazon announced that its Project Ranier, in Indiana, is now in use – and is one of the largest AI compute clusters in the world. The project, an $11 billion data center build, features nearly half a million Trainium2 chips, and was deployed less than one year after its plans were first announced. Anthropic, which partners with Amazon on AI ventures, is already running workloads at Project Rainer. The project is an undertaking of AWS, which created the custom-designed Trainium2 chips.\n\nEarly in November, AWS announced a multi-year strategic partnership that empowers OpenAI. The agreement, worth $38 billion over seven years, gives OpenAI access to AWS’s top-notch platform and infrastructure to run world-class AI workloads.\nAll of this underscores both the growth of AWS and its increasing interconnection with Amazon’s AI undertakings. This is also clear from the company’s financial results. In the 3Q25 report, the last released, it showed that AWS revenue came to $33 billion, for 20% year-over-year growth. AWS made up over 18% of Amazon’s total revenue. That total revenue came to $180.2 billion in the third quarter, and was up more than 13% year-over-year while beating the forecast by $2.4 billion. Amazon reported a net income of $21.2 billion, and an EPS of $1.95.\n\nAnmuth, covering Amazon’s stock for JPMorgan, is looking at an upbeat future based on strong gains in the AI businesses. He states, “We remain bullish into 2026 supported by AWS growth acceleration, solid Stores growth & continued share gains, N.America & Int’l OI margin expansion, and solid AWS margins, all of which we believe support FCF doubling to $59B even against AI-driven capex growth. Strong secular growth, workload/tech migrations, & AI contribution/partnerships (including Project Rainier & OpenAI) drive AWS growth acceleration. We project 2026 AWS growth of +23%, vs. +19% in 2025, which could prove conservative… We view valuation as attractive, w/shares trading at ~24x 2027E GAAP EPS & ~31x 2027E FCF.”\nAnmuth rates as Overweight (i.e., Buy), a rating that he complements with a $305 price target that suggests a one-year upside potential of 35%.\nOverall, the 46 recent analyst reviews on AMZN have a lopsided split of 45 Buys to 1 Hold behind their Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently trading at $226.50, and their $295.62 average price target implies an upside of 30.5% by this time next year. (See AMZN stock forecast )\nDoorDash\nThe last of JPM’s ‘top picks’ on our radar is DoorDash, the Silicon Valley company that specializes in food ordering and delivery. DoorDash has been in business since 2013, and today is a $95 billion leader in its field. DoorDash operates across the US and in an additional 30 countries. It connects its customers to their favorite eateries and food suppliers through its online marketplace and commerce platforms.\n\nFor several years now, DoorDash has been working to expand by acquisition. During this past year, the company made two important deals, acquiring the restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion in cash and the British food delivery firm Deliveroo in a $3.9 billion transaction. DoorDash said this past November that it intends to keep up its big spending and outlined ‘several hundred million’ in planned expenses for projects ranging from improvements in global tech stacks to autonomous delivery units.\nDoorDash is already making strides in autonomous delivery. It released its first autonomous robot delivery vehicle, Dot, this past September. Dot is designed to tackle local delivery routes, using sidewalks, bike lanes, and driveways, and it is currently in use in Tempe, Arizona, and Mesa, Arizona, for an early access program. Tempe and Mesa are small cities, and DoorDash has plans to ramp up the robot to larger urban areas.\n\nOn the financial side, we can look at DoorDash’s 3Q25 report. The company listed $3.4 billion in revenue for the period, a figure that was up 27% year-over-year and came $89 million better than forecasts had predicted. DoorDash’s bottom line figure, listed as 55 cents earnings per share, was 13 cents per share below expectations – although it was also up significantly from the 38-cent figure reported in the prior-year quarter. We should note that DoorDash had on hand, at the end of Q3, $7.4 billion in cash and other liquid assets – so its indication of intent to spend ‘several hundred million’ on various improvements and projects may be less worrisome than was first assumed.\nThe JPM take on DASH is laid out, again, by Doug Anmuth. The analyst, who is rated by TipRanks in the top 2% of Wall Street’s analysts, writes of DoorDash’s likely prospects: “We highlight that DASH’s strong performance in the core business over the last several years has been driven by platform investments, and we expect the current wave to also generate substantial ROI over the next few years. While payback on these investments could vary we think concerns around re-platforming execution risk are likely overstated. We also think consensus has layered in the costs from these investments for ‘26 and beyond, however, it likely under-estimating the associated returns. We also expect DASH to invest in Deliveroo and gain share in key markets like the UK & France as the company looks to drive stronger top-line growth and optimize the business for L-T profit dollars.”\n\nSetting out the bottom line, Anmuth adds, “Amidst these incremental investments, we think DASH will continue to see strong trends in the core business, with a focus on selection, quality, affordability and service levels driving better retention as well as order frequency.”\nIn his final assessment, Anmuth puts an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on DASH stock, with a $300 price target that indicates room for a 36% upside on the one-year time frame.\nAll in all, DASH shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating that is backed by 28 analysts’ reviews, including 23 Buys and 5 Holds. With a share price of $219.79 and an average target price of $281.12, DASH has a ~28% upside potential for the coming year.

(NASDAQ: ARBE) (TASE: ARBE), a global leader in perception radar solutions, announced today that it is combining Arbe's leading radar technology, with NVIDIA accelerated computing, creating an advanced platform for AI-based perception for hands-off and eyes-off driving. For the first time, at CES 2026 Arbe will showcase its automotive-grade radar system and demonstrate its readiness for integration with complete perception stacks.\n\nThe automotive-grade radar delivers unprecedented detection density, a raw point cloud of over 20,000 detections per frame, generated by a channel array of 2,304 channels, providing a rich foundation that enables systems to run advanced perception and AI algorithms. The combination of Arbe's affordable, high-performance radar solution and NVIDIA's powerful computing is democratizing autonomous technology, making advanced perception accessible, reliable and cost-effective.\n\n\"This initiative allows us to create a new benchmark for perception in all conditions. The collaboration accelerates the adoption of safer, more reliable, and more affordable autonomous driving solutions for automakers worldwide,\" says Kobi Marenko, co-founder and CEO of Arbe. \"At CES, we are demonstrating our ultra-HD radar in action and how it navigates complicated highway scenarios at true highway speeds.\"\nTo enable eyes-off capabilities at highway speeds, accurate long-range detection and object separation are imperative. When a car travels at a speed of up to 130 km/h (approximately 80 mph), it needs to safely detect vehicles and obstacles at a 300 meter distance to give the system enough time to brake gradually, change lanes, or take other action without causing disruptions to surrounding traffic. Arbe's ultra-HD radar achieves over 300-meter point cloud range detections while delivering the resolution and dynamic range needed to interpret complex highway scenarios and introduce features for smooth, human-like driving.\n\nThe Arbe HD radar solution offers consistent, reliable performance across all environmental conditions, including snow, sleet, rain, fog, and low-visibility scenarios. By providing robust perception in situations where other sensor modalities may be challenged, Arbe's perception radar maintains dependable operation at all times. Arbe's perception radar, when combined with accelerated computing by NVIDIA, delivers consistent performance, enabling eyes-off driving at highway speeds with the human-like flow and predictability required for real safety and consumer trust.\n\nStory Continues\nLive Demonstrations at CES 2026, Booth 4551, West Hall, LVCC\nArbe will present live demonstrations of its automotive-grade radar technology, including:\nAI-based Occupancy Grid: In collaboration with Perciv AI, Arbe will showcase an AI-based Occupancy Grid that delivers a highly detailed map of the space surrounding the vehicle, illustrating occupied areas and relevant use cases for advanced perception.\nLiDAR-like Performance with HD radar: Arbe will demonstrate how its high-definition radar can achieve performance comparable to LiDAR, enabling lower overall sensor suite costs while improving system redundancy.\nIntegration with NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin: Arbe's high-resolution radar data will be processed on the NVIDIA in-vehicle computing platform.\n\nTo schedule a demo of Arbe's advanced radar technology, visit https://arberobotics.com/ces2026/ .\nAbout Arbe\nArbe (Nasdaq: ARBE), a global leader in ultra-high-resolution radar solutions, is driving a radar revolution. Its cutting-edge radar chipset delivers up to 100 times more detail than other radar systems on the market, empowering automakers and radar Tier-1s to develop safe driving systems that scale from ADAS to hands-free, eyes-off capabilities and up to full vehicle autonomy. Arbe's technology addresses the most critical use cases by delivering real-time, 4-dimensional imaging that enables the perception stack with information such as precise mapping of drivable free space in highway and urban environments across all weather and lighting conditions. With its transformative impact across passenger, commercial, and industrial vehicle segments, as well as other advanced safety applications, Arbe is redefining the role of radar in next-generation mobility.\n\nHeadquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel, the company also operates offices in the United States, Germany, and China.

      "Content": "The Next Phase of the AI Boom Could Be Even Bigger for Nvidia\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 3:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia is shifting production capacity to maximize its data center products.\nNvidia is resuming sales to China.\nRubin architecture will drive a massive spending spree among its clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an absolutely incredible performer over the past three years. Its stock outperformed the market in 2023, 2024, and 2025, but can it do it in 2026? I think this next phase of artificial intelligence could be even bigger for Nvidia.\nHow is that possible? Let's find out.\nNvidia has sold out its capacity When reviewing Nvidia's Q3 results, CEO Jensen Huang noted that Nvidia was \"sold out\" of cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) . That's simply incredible, especially considering that Nvidia generated $57 billion in total revenue. Data center GPUs made up the majority of that total, with $51.2 billion in sales coming from that division.\n\nThe data center division also encompasses other non-GPU products Nvidia makes to support its ecosystem. However, it's still impressive to sell out of a product when sales are already that high. To meet the unprecedented demand, Nvidia is looking to expand production capacity in any way possible. While it's pushing its suppliers upstream to provide more chips and other hardware, it's also making capacity changes on other product lines.\nOne area where Nvidia is making some hard choices is that it's reportedly cutting production capacity for its gaming chips. Gaming generated $4.3 billion in revenue during Q3 for Nvidia, so it's not insignificant to Nvidia's business, but it could free up some chip capacity to build more profitable and in-demand data center GPUs.\n\nCombined with the increased supply chain, these two factors will increase Nvidia's production capacity to meet customer demand. However, meeting all of their demand may not be possible due to the sheer volume required by its clients.\nSo, next time you hear about an AI hyperscaler launching its own chip or signing a deal with a competitor, like Advaced Micro Devices , investors shouldn't assume that Nvidia's product is inferior. It could be that Nvidia doesn't have the capacity that they need, so they are turning to alternative sources.\nThis bodes well for Nvidia's future and will allow it to control the margins and pricing on its products if supply constraints persist. However, two other factors could provide Nvidia with a significant growth boost in 2026.\n\nNvidia is returning to China and launching a new product In April 2025, Nvidia's export license to ship H20 chips (which were specifically created to abide by U.S. export laws to China) was revoked. This caused a huge dent in Nvidia's business, although the company kept growing rapidly. For Q2, Nvidia expected about $8 billion in revenue from H20 sales. That revenue could return shortly, but it has a catch.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia is allowed to sell the chips again, but at a 25% fee. It's unknown whether Nvidia will eat the fee or pass that on to the customer, but either way, Nvidia is gaining back a massive client that will boost its growth in 2026. It's also still unclear what restrictions Beijing will put on those sales.\n\nAnother factor for 2026 is the launch of Nvidia's next-generation architecture. The current Blackwell architecture provides impressive results, but its successor, Rubin, will be even more impressive. This upgrade will drive further costs associated with switching to 800-volt power.\nNvidia is poised to capitalize on the significant upgrades that its latest and greatest system will offer, further strengthening its growth case.\nAll of this adds up to Nvidia's vision for future data center construction. Nvidia believes that global data center capital expenditures will rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from around $600 billion in 2025. That's simply amazing growth, and if the industry actually does reach those spending levels, Nvidia's stock could skyrocket over the next few years as a result.\n\nWith all of the massive upgrades coming down the pipeline for Nvidia, a return to China, and increasing production capacity by decreasing output of other product lines, Nvidia is doing everything it can to maximize sales. I think this will bode well for Nvidia's stock, and 2026 could be its biggest year yet.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be Microsoft's Stock Price at the End of 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 3:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Microsoft is taking a neutral position in the AI buildout.\nCopilot still needs to prove its worth to its users.\nMicrosoft carries a premium valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) had a strong 2025, rising from about $420 per share at the start of 2025 to around $490 by December. That's about a 17% return, making it a strong stock pick in normal years. However, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) also had a great year, rising around 18%. This means that Microsoft's stock lost to the market despite an impressive year.\nLooking ahead to 2026, will Microsoft be able to outperform the market? Or will it be another year of market-matching to market-losing performance? Let's figure out what Microsoft's stock price could be to end 2026, and see if that will be good enough to beat the market.\nMicrosoft is a neutral player in the AI race There are several varieties of companies involved in the artificial intelligence realm. Microsoft is more of an AI facilitator rather than a developer, which could have its benefits and drawbacks as we move closer to an AI-first world.\nOne of Microsoft's major components that isn't discussed enough is its Azure cloud computing business. Azure is the second-largest cloud computing service behind Amazon Web Services (AWS), but it may not stay there for long with its rapid growth rate. In first-quarter fiscal year 2026 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), Azure's revenue rose 40% year over year, doubling AWS' 20% growth. Azure's performance likely has to do with the fact that it's neutral in what generative AI models it offers to users.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has a 27% OpenAI stake, that's not the only model it offers on Azure. Developers can deploy competing models like xAI's Grok or Anthropic's Claude, or choose a cost-efficient model from DeepSeek. Because Microsoft isn't tying its success to one model, it can benefit from the rising tide of increased AI usage.\nOne area where increased AI usage has benefited Microsoft is its Office products. Its Copilot add-on, which gives users generative AI capabilities specifically for these platforms, has become popular and helped deliver 17% Microsoft 365 commercial growth and 26% 365 consumer growth.\nAll these trends that existed in 2025 aren't likely to disappear in 2026, and Wall Street analyst projections back that assumption up. For FY 2026 (ending June 30, 2026), expect Microsoft to deliver 16% sales growth. For FY 2027 (ending June 30, 2027), the consensus estimate for Microsoft's revenue growth is 15%. That's pretty much on par with where Microsoft has been over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\nMicrosoft is a very successful business, but it's also quite predictable. This should give us a great basis on which to build out our stock price estimate.\nMicrosoft won't get any help from an increased valuation One area investors must consider to predict a stock price is how the company will be valued. Thirty times forward earnings (or greater) has become the norm for big tech companies like Microsoft and its peers, and assigning a year-end valuation of 30 times forward earnings is reasonable and fair.\nIf Microsoft can deliver a 15% growth rate from a revenue and earnings perspective throughout the back half of FY 2026 and the first half of FY 2027, and maintain its 30 times forward earnings valuation, that would indicate the stock will rise by the corresponding growth rate.\nSo, with Microsoft's stock trading at about $485 per share right now, my year-end stock price expectation for Microsoft would be nearly $560. As mentioned above, that growth rate wasn't enough to beat the market in 2025. However, over the long term, if Microsoft can continue growing at a double-digit growth rate, I have no doubt that it will maintain its status as a long-term winner, making it a solid stock to buy now and hold for several years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "加入《Money錢》雜誌官方line＠財經資訊不漏接\n\n台股加權指數今（2025）年下半年以來，經歷數月的上漲行情後，在11月回檔修正，若回測季線（至11/19截稿日約26,330點）能守住，整理期可望縮短；若跌破季線，預期在25,000點以下有強勁支撐，震盪整理期將拉長。即便大盤跌破季線，仍是分批低接台積電（2330）等AI股的好時機，2026年第1季可望挑戰30,000點。\n\n今年9月上旬，台股加權指數首度站上25,000點，台積電為首的AI族群價量齊揚，利多消息頻傳，原先保守觀望的散戶在樂觀氣氛下持續加碼，融資增加幅度明顯，外資則在高檔邊拉抬股價邊出貨（10月至11月19日累計賣超3,091億元），這是近期台股大回檔的背景因素。\n\n近年台股跟美股同樣由AI族群領漲，由於漲勢集中在少數幾家龍頭指標股，且漲幅都很大，加上輝達（Nvidia）斥資1千億美元入股AI新創公司OpenAI（營運尚處於虧損，但估值很高）換取後者擴大採購自家GPU、AI伺服器，近期投資人對於AI泡沫化的疑慮升高。\n\n不過，AI是決定國力與企業生產力的技術革命，尤其美國、中國都投入巨資打造AI基礎建設，絕不允許自己在這場科技競賽中落居下風，其它有條件的國家也想要打造本國專屬的AI資料中心（主權AI），並藉此帶動產業轉型升級。\n\n目前全球仍處於擴大AI基礎建設投資的階段，投資人還不需要擔心AI算力過剩，倒是要留意若電力供應跟不上，AI的發展會短暫受阻。\n\nAI科技巨頭微軟（Mircosoft）執行長納德拉（Satya Nadella）11月初與OpenAI執行長奧特曼（Sam Altman）隔空接受《Bg2 Pod》節目專訪談到，目前AI產業面臨的問題並非算力供過於求，而是缺乏足夠電力。納德拉甚至說，因電力供應不足，微軟目前有一部分AI GPU閒置在倉庫中。\n\n這也意謂電力公司，或者提供電力系統設備與建置管理服務的廠商，有機會在AI基礎建設投資狂潮中受惠，例如：華城（1519）、東元（1504）、高力（8996）、盈正（3628）、康舒（6282）等。不過，這些公司股價大都已飆漲，本益比也偏高，投資人須審慎評估買點。\n\n投資人觀察的重點不在於這些科技巨頭說了什麼，而是「做了什麼」。從亞馬遜（Amazon）、Google、Meta等美國AI科技巨頭持續擴大資本支出的態勢看來，AI投資泡沫在未來1～2年會持續膨脹，已上車且成本低的投資人不必急著下車，新進投資人宜趁股價回檔建立基本持股，但切勿使用融資等財務槓桿，以免在市場震盪加劇時受傷。\n\n台股AI族群當中，投資人較熟悉的是台積電、創意（3443）、日月光投控（3711）、台達電（2308）、光寶科（2301）、智邦（2345）、信驊（5274）、台光電（2383）、台燿（6274）、金像電（2368）、欣興（3037）、奇鋐（3017）、雙鴻（3324）、健策（3653）、鴻海（2317）、緯創（3231）、緯穎（6669）等。這些個股在回檔整理過後，有些會再創新高，其中台積電是穩健投資人的首選，建議1,400元以下找買點。\n\n台股AI族群當中，目前最值得的關注的是高階晶片的分選與測試設備大廠鴻勁（7769）。該公司產品包含測試分類機（Handler）、主動式溫控系統（ATC）、水冷板（Cold Plate）與客製化治具等整套方案，可因應AI高效能運算（HPC）、車用與通訊晶片高功耗、高頻測試需求，受輝達、亞馬遜等美系終端大客戶青睞。因其設備主要出貨給終端客戶指定的亞洲地區半導體封測廠，輸美關稅的影響很小。\n\n鴻勁甫於今年11月27日以1,495元承銷價從興櫃轉上市掛牌。截至2025年11月18日，鴻勁市值高達3,854億元，法人看好其強勁成長動能將延續到明後年。某外資券商在最新出爐的研究報告中，依其現增後股本18.1億元（原股本為16.1億元）預估，2025、2026、2027年稅後EPS分別為75.2、96、115.7元，並將目標價從2,500元調升至3,500元。\n\n鴻勁去年登錄興櫃，股價最低在今年4月跌到570元（川普宣布開徵「對等關稅」引發全球股市重挫），最高於11月初漲到2,625元，近期一度跌到2,200元，IPO前競拍結束後股價又開始上漲。這次新股競拍數量為13,198張，得標加權均價為2,030.37元，最低、最高得標平均價分別為1,930、2,285元，都遠高於底價1,196元，可見非常搶手。\n\n鴻勁轉上市掛牌後，隨著流動性提升，會吸引更多外資、投信（興櫃交易期間不能買）買盤，進一步推高市值，明年第1季正式納入元大台灣50（0050）成分股後，將成為台股市值型被動ETF、主動科技ETF的基本持股，長多行情值得期待。\n\n除了鴻勁，主攻印刷電路板（PCB）及半導體設備的大量（3167）也是值得高度關注的成長股。受惠於AI高階封裝需求，大量的高階CCD背鑽機（高精密PCB鑽孔機）銷售量大增，今年產能滿載，目前在手訂單交期已排到2026年，可望帶動明年營運進一步走高。\n\n大量除了深耕高階PCB設備，也成功跨入半導體領域，後者占上半年營收比重近1成，其中包括量測（前段製程鎖定化學機械研磨的研磨墊量測、晶圓級量測）、自動光學檢測（AOI）及自動化設備，已出貨給國內晶圓代工和封測大廠，在SoIC、InFO與CoWoS等先進封裝皆有對應的產品。\n\n因應客戶大單需求，大量今年擴增產能50%，第3季已陸續投產。受惠PCB高階機型與半導體設備出貨量成長，大量今年前10個月累計合併營收40.28億元，年增108.47%，全年營收估較去年成長80%～90%，2026年營運將更上一層樓。\n\n電子上游的DRAM、Nand Flash族群，下半年漲勢十分凌厲，指標股分別是南亞科（2408）、華邦（2344）、群聯（8299），其中僅群聯推出直接受惠AI需求的新產品，是相對穩健的投資標的。\n\n聯準會（Fed）先前連續2個月降息，今年12月可能暫停降息，但現任主席鮑爾（Jerome Powell）明年5月將卸任，川普準備提名對降息配合度較高的接任人選，市場預期明年下半年Fed將加速降息，聯邦基金利率可能降至3%，這有利於明年上半年（尤其是第1季）AI科技股的表現，也有利於備受壓抑的營建、資產股表現（2026年縣市長大選前政策做多有加分作用）。\n\n（圖片來源：Shutterstock僅示意 / 內容僅供參考，投資請謹慎為上）\n\n文章出處：《Money錢》2025年12月號\n\n下載「錢雜誌App」隨時隨地掌握財經脈動",

A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years.

      "Content": "Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) Could Become A Multi-Bagger\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 2:40 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nIf you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Cirrus Logic's ( NASDAQ:CRUS ) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Cirrus Logic is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.20 = US$449m ÷ (US$2.4b - US$210m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025) .\nTherefore, Cirrus Logic has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 8.9%.\nView our latest analysis for Cirrus Logic\nIn the above chart we have measured Cirrus Logic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Cirrus Logic .\nSo How Is Cirrus Logic's ROCE Trending? We like the trends that we're seeing from Cirrus Logic. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 20%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 46%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Cirrus Logic thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nThe Key Takeaway To sum it up, Cirrus Logic has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Considering the stock has delivered 31% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.\nOne more thing, we've spotted 1 warning sign facing Cirrus Logic that you might find interesting.\n\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\nHave feedback on this article?

The company&rsquo;s international expansion and diversification across e-commerce, AWS cloud services, advertising, and streaming create multiple revenue streams while reducing concentration risk.\n\nManagement's Q4 2025 guidance projects net sales of $206-$213 billion with operating income between $21-$26 billion, reflecting operational efficiency gains. AI integration across operations enhances personalization, logistics and AWS offerings, strengthening competitive positioning. The Zacks analyst expect 2025 net sales to grow 10.6% from 2024.\nHowever, substantial capital expenditure requirements for AI infrastructure and data centers strain financial resources and compress margins. The company's expanding debt burden reduces financial flexibility amid rising interest rates. Intensifying competition from Walmart, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud is an overhang.\n\nStory Continues\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>> )\nShares of Palantir have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past six months (+32.3% vs. -6.5%). The company&rsquo;s AI strategy, driven by Foundry, Gotham, and AIP platforms, targets government and commercial sectors, enabling real-time insights and operational efficiency. Notable defense projects, like Open DAGIR and AIP boot camps for commercial clients, boost customer acquisition.\n\nWith $5.4 billion in cash, no debt, and S&P 500 inclusion, Palantir enjoys strong liquidity, growing revenues, and increased investor visibility. Meanwhile, PLTR's reluctance to pay dividends is a green flag for dividend-seeking investors.\nIntense competition from tech giants and rising costs amidst a rapidly evolving AI landscape and an elevated valuation challenge its appeal. Palantir shares have gained 122.5% in a year, and we have a neutral rating on it in anticipation of a correction.\n(You can read the full research report on Palantir here >>> )\nTotalEnergies&rsquo; shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past six months (+5.9% vs. +1.7%). The company is gaining from contributions coming from startups, acquired assets, well-spread LNG assets and upstream assets located in the new hydrocarbon-producing regions. Contributions from multi-energy assets spread across the globe boost its earnings.\n\nTotalEnergies&rsquo; free cash flow allows it to increase shareholders&rsquo; value. Cost reduction initiatives will boost margins and the company aims to generate 15-20% of sales from low-carbon business by 2040. TotalEnergies is investing in clean power generation and lowering emissions.\nYet TotalEnergies operates multiple assets globally, and in some regions, production might be impacted due to security concerns. It remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production.\n(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here >>> )\nShares of MIND Technology have gained +11.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Technology Services industry&rsquo;s gain of +15.4%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $79.44 million shows improving near-term visibility, with a $9.5 million seismic contract secured in December 2025, highlighting product demand. Recent expansion of its Huntsville facility supports higher-margin throughput and positions the firm for complex project growth.\n\nNew capital flexibility via a $25 million ATM offering and $4 million repurchase program enhances strategic agility. MIND benefits from exposure to a resilient global marine seismic market and operates a globally diversified footprint, aiding responsiveness and contract wins.\nHowever, declining revenue and backlog highlight demand volatility, and a growing reliance on aftermarket sales may limit long-term upside. Profitability is pressured by modestly rising operating expenses.

      "Content": "財經中心／王駿凱報導\n\n2025年被譽為全球金融市場的「雲霄飛車」之年。自4月起，由於對等關稅的影響，全球股市遭遇重挫，但隨著關稅逐步鬆綁，中美關係的改善，市場在年底之前一路攀升。\n\n儘管11月時AI相關疑慮再度浮現，年底出現賣壓使得收盤顯得起伏不定，但12月底市場仍強勢回升，國內股市及臺積電也收在年內最高點。在2025年的投資策略中，關鍵在於掌握川普的個性，只有理解其節奏，才能在市場因對等關稅修正而面臨的挑戰中，實現投資組合的豐收。街口臺灣基金經理人蘇昱霖指出，展望2026年，川普的言行仍將是市場的焦點。預期股市在漲勢後可能出現短期波動，但也可視為逢低買進的良機。另外，預計2026年聯準會主席改選後的新任人選將會配合川普推動降息政策，這將對市場形成利多影響。近期需留意日本及部分新興市場央行的鷹派姿態，但只要各國央行的政策不過度激進，全球資金流向依然將主要受到美國聯準會政策的指引。在產業發展方面，2026年AI依然是主流，尤其在美國解除H200禁令後，NVIDIA的發展前景看好。Google在去年底推出的Gemini服務以大幅折扣和2T記憶體促銷，吸引許多使用者轉向付費AI服務，使得AI雙引擎NVIDIA與Google的未來增長潛力持續受到看好。\n\n在2025最重要的是摸清楚川普的個性，只要掌握此一節奏，在對等關稅引發的市場修正中，反而有機會為投資組合帶來豐收的一年(圖/民視財經網)\n\n回到臺積電的情況，雖然製程技術先進且持續領先競爭對手，由於滿載的狀態，部分客戶或考慮轉向三星或Intel的試單，但預計2026年及2027年仍以臺積電為主。先進封裝及相關測試技術也將持續增長，記憶體產業在需求增長的情況下，對未來報價保持正面看法。\n\n街口投信預測，2026年第一季有望擺脫先前的震盪，並開始走高。儘管全年仍可能因特定因素引發激烈波動，但只要掌握川普的行為模式及產業趨勢，若無過度的黑天鵝事件，預估2026將是持續的多頭市場年度。\n\n《民視新聞網》提醒您：內容僅供參考，投資人於決策時應審慎評估風險，並就投資結果自行負責。\n\n原文出處：2025年股市雲霄飛車：川普動向掀起市場風暴！\n\n更多民視新聞報導伊朗匯率崩！1美元換140萬里爾 最高領袖哈米尼傳將逃往莫斯科靠1檔ETF「領113萬股息」！最後買進日曝…他卻苦惱了高市早苗率內閣團隊參拜伊勢神宮 小野田紀美新年首度亮相引稱讚",

      "Content": "台股5日開高走高，且在台積電領軍下，大盤指數終場登上3萬點，續創歷史新高，外資熱錢湧入下，推升新台幣兌美元匯價5日早盤再度升破31.4元價位，但美國對委內瑞拉發動空襲，並逮捕總統馬杜羅夫婦，美元指數大漲，加上壽險適用會計新制，2026年以來明顯加碼買美元，新台幣在午盤後回貶，終場重挫1角以上，貶回31.5元關卡。\n\n股市延續開年好彩頭，台股終於衝破30K目標，新台幣開盤漲勢同步延續，但盤中走勢豬羊變色，外資午後擴大匯出力道，加上壽險系銀行美元買盤強烈，終場收在31.538元、重挫1.19角或0.38%，創去年5月1日以來逾八個月收盤新低，單日貶幅則是近二周最大，總成交量同步放大至22.335億美元。\n\n「匯市盤勢蠻怪的」，匯銀主管直言，股市盤中一度大漲900點，終場收漲逾750點，新台幣上午跟漲，但午後豬羊變色翻黑，主要有三大因素，首先是外資在台股仍小幅賣超，午盤起匯出力道很大，其次是受美國逮捕委內瑞拉總統影響，美股小幅走揚，但這部分對市場影響不大。\n\n最關鍵因素是壽險美元買盤。匯銀主管表示，壽險業滿手現金，盤中除了大買台股權值股，今年起因壽險業會計新制上路，開紅盤後兩個交易日都明顯加碼美元買盤，尤其是壽險系的銀行，包括國泰世華銀行、台北富邦銀行、中國信託銀行等，盤中美元買盤都不小。\n\n匯銀主管指出，「盤面上最多錢都是壽險」，先前壽險業都是透過NDF避險，現在可透過現貨去買美元，後續要觀察壽險美元買盤是否維持高檔，若導致新台幣走勢轉向，預計影響會很大，「後續新台幣不排除會被軋到蠻貶的」，甚至測試32元整數。\n\n匯銀主管也說，央行希望匯市升貶取得平衡，去年下半年央行似乎有意將新台幣守在31.6元下方，新台幣仍以緩貶為主，但照壽險業近二日買匯力道，假設後續一天貶值1角，32元確實指日可待，出口商也可能轉為惜售，加速匯價貶速。\n\n匯銀主管認為，「確實想不到匯價會這樣走」，預計後續先在31.48～31.58元之間震盪，但拉長時間就很難預測，匯價轉向比預期更快，後續要持續觀察幾天才能判斷，但預計仍是資金面影響為主。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導買房竟送百萬裝潢！「禾懋花園」推限量優惠 稀有產品受市場矚目22歲天才少女復仇！破解NVIDIA晶片 只因看不慣「7萬元電子垃圾」台灣自行車王國衰敗？巨大、美利達股價殺回10年前 專家揭2挑戰",

      "Content": "Earnings Preview: What to Expect From NXP Semiconductors’ Report\n\nKritika Sarmah\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 1:37 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nWith a market cap of $55.7 billion, NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) is a leading global semiconductor company headquartered in the Netherlands. It specializes in embedded processing, secure connectivity, and analog solutions, securing a strong competitive position in automotive electronics, which is its largest revenue driver, supplying chips for vehicle networking, safety, infotainment, and software-defined vehicle architectures.\n\nThe company is slated to announce its fiscal Q4 2025 results soon. Ahead of this event, analysts expect NXP Semiconductors to report an EPS of $2.93, a 3.5% increase from $2.83 in the year-ago quarter. It has exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of the past four quarters while missing on another occasion.\nMore News from Barchart Tesla Stock Has Been Flat For 2 Months - How to Make a 3.2% Yield in One-Month Puts\nCES 2026, Sector Rotation and Other Key Things to Watch this Week\nStocks Set to Open Higher as Investors Stay Calm Despite Venezuela Tumult, U.S. Jobs Data Awaited\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect the chipmaker to report EPS of $10.22, marking an 11.4% drop from $11.54 in fiscal 2024. However, EPS is anticipated to grow 18.1% year-over-year to $12.07 in fiscal 2026.\nShares of NXP Semiconductors have surged 7.3% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 16.9% increase and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF's (XSD) 33.1% surge over the same period.\nOn Dec. 19, Shares of NXP Semiconductors rose 2.6% in afternoon trading after Truist Securities analyst William Stein raised his price target on the stock to $265 from $254 while reaffirming a “Buy” rating, signaling increased confidence in the company’s valuation. The move was also supported by broader optimism across the semiconductor sector, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence, data centers, and high-performance computing, which continues to underpin expectations of sustained industry growth.\n\nAnalysts' consensus view on NXPI stock remains bullish, with an overall \"Strong Buy\" rating. Out of 30 analysts covering the stock, 22 recommend a \"Strong Buy,\" two \"Moderate Buys,\" and six \"Holds.\" The average analyst price target for NXP Semiconductors is $259.29, indicating a potential upside of 17.2% from the current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Kritika Sarmah did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

At the same time, the 1 year total shareholder return of 262.79% and the very large 3 year total shareholder return show how strongly sentiment has swung around this high beta mix of bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure, as investors weigh growth potential against dilution risk and higher short interest.\n\nIf IREN's AI and crypto mix has grabbed your attention, it could be a good moment to scan other high growth tech and AI names through high growth tech and AI stocks for fresh ideas.\nWith a 1 year total return above 260%, fresh short interest near 15% and a large Microsoft AI contract in play, you have to ask yourself: is IREN still mispriced, or is the market already baking in years of future growth?\nMost Popular Narrative: 55% Undervalued According to BlackGoat, the narrative fair value of US$94.84 sits well above IREN's last close at US$42.70. This frames a sizable upside gap before you even factor in its Microsoft contract and AI expansion plans.\nRead the complete narrative.\nWhat earnings ramp justifies that gap? The narrative leans on rapid revenue expansion, rising profit margins and a premium future P/E usually reserved for high growth software names. Curious which assumptions really drive that US$94.84 figure and 55% discount call?\nResult: Fair Value of $94.84 (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, that upside story can break quickly if Bitcoin prices weaken, or if further equity raises and dilution blunt the impact of any future earnings ramp investors are expecting.\nFind out about the key risks to this IREN narrative.\nBuild Your Own IREN Narrative If you are not fully on board with this view or just prefer to weigh the numbers yourself, you can build a custom thesis in minutes with Do it your way\nA great starting point for your IREN research is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards and 3 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking for more investment ideas?

      "Content": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Apple, Dell and One Stop Systems\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 1:12 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nDELL\n\nOSS\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL – January 5, 2026 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL and One Stop Systems OSS.\nIndustry: Micro-Computers\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2810915/3-stocks-to-watch-from-the-challenging-computer-industry\nThe Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry players are suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Heightened geopolitical challenges post-U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on trade partners are expected to hurt industry participants. Weak demand in China has been a headwind. However, industry participants like Apple , Dell Technologies and One Stop Systems are benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones.\n\nThe improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables, hearables and PCs is another major growth driver for industry participants.\nIndustry Description The Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based on either iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung.\n\nExpanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n3 Micro Computer Industry Trends to Watch Enterprise Adoption Remains Healthy : Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\n\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand : Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\n\nStory Continues\nAI-enabled PCs to Boost Demand : Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be they Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based ones, are expected to benefit from AI infusion. The addition of neural processing units (NPUs), which are dedicated units to manage AI-related tasks, in PCs is a driving demand for AI-enabled devices. AMD, Qualcomm and Intel offer NPU chips with OEMs such as ASUS, Acer, Lenovo, Microsoft, HP and others building these AI-enabled devices. Canalys expects AI-capable PC shipments to make up 50% of PC shipments in 2026. This offers significant growth opportunities for industry participants.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospect The Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #190, which places it in the bottom 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bearish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since March 31, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this industry’s 2026 earnings has moved south by 0.5%.\nGiven the dull outlook, there are only a few stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present those stocks, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500 The Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, as well as the S&P 500, over the past year.\nThe industry has returned 9% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s growth of 19.6% and the broader sector’s appreciation of 27.4%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation On the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 31.06X compared with the S&P 500’s 23.30X and the sector’s 29.55X.\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 31.48X and as low as 26.24X, with the median being 27.69X.\n\n3 Computer Stocks to Watch Right Now One Stop Systems : This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers specialized enterprise-class high-performance compute, high-speed switch fabrics and storage hardware and software. These are designed to target edge applications for AI and machine learning, sensor processing, sensor fusion and autonomy. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOne Stop’s product pipeline is expanding across leading defense organizations and advanced commercial enterprises. The company is investing in next-generation product development and advancing new program opportunities that are expected to contribute to positive bookings growth in 2026 and 2027. Increase exposure on the P-8 Poseidon Reconnaissance aircraft program bodes well for OSS.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 earnings has been steady at 8 cents per share over the past 30 days. The stock has appreciated 113.4% in a year.\nDell Technologies : This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers, driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. The growing demand for AI-enabled PCs is contributing to its Client Solutions Group’s (CSG) revenue growth.\n\nDell Technologies’ ongoing PC refresh cycle has been noteworthy. The company’s leadership emphasized that the transition to Windows 11 is not yet finished. About 500 million PCs that can run Windows 11 are still waiting for upgrades.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings has been steady at $9.89 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has appreciated 11% in a year.\nApple : This Zacks Rank #3 company’s prospects ride on continued iPhone 16 series sales and strong iPhone 17 series adoption. Apple now expects the December quarter’s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) iPhone sales to grow in double digits year over year.\nServices, which comprises Apple’s advertising business, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital content (Arcade, Music, Fitness+, TV, News+) and Payment services (Apple Card & Apple Pay), is riding on an expanding base of installed devices. Apple’s Services segment benefits from an expanding games portfolio and the growing popularity of Apple TV+. Apple’s strategy of adding new games on a continuous basis is driving its user base. Apple TV+ is benefiting from an expanding content portfolio.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has increased 7 cents to $8.11 per share over the past 60 days. Apple shares have increased 9% in the trailing 12-month period.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

      "Content": "台積電今（5日）股價一度大漲110元，最高來到1695元，再度刷新紀錄，創下自今年4月以來最大單日漲幅。美國財經媒體撰文分析，台積電暴漲背後推長動力來自高盛（Goldman Sachs）。\n\n在Aletheia Capital 將台積電目標價提高到2400元之後，高盛也把目標價上調35%至2330元，進而吸引市場資金追捧。\n\n高盛在報告中提到，人工智慧將使產能緊張持續至2027年，因矽晶圓持續供不應求，預計台積電從2026年起，未來三年間總資本支出超過1500億美元。\n\n高盛預計台積電3奈米及5奈米晶圓產能在2026、2027年保持緊張，預測這兩年以美元計算的營收成長，分別年增30%和28%，高於先前對這兩個時期均為22%的預估。\n\n市場普遍預期台積電未來一年仍將維持強勁成長動能。外媒seekingalpha報導，台積電正持續增強公司實力，而且市場對其估值過低，預估未來股價仍具備約50%至85%的上漲空間。\n\n台股大師杜金龍過去在許多財經節目分享，以台積電2027年獲利有機會突破百元來看，股價上看2000元，他並透露台積電只要跌50元到70元，他就會分批進場買，持股續抱不會賣出。\n\n◎免責聲明：本文的個股、ETF與專家觀點，非任何投資建議與參考，投資人應獨立判斷，審慎評估風險，自負盈虧。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導初評就喊190！比鴻海、廣達都物美價廉 法人大推這檔老AI 本益比僅11倍太香了00878、00919才填息 出場訊號就亮燈？達人讚1策略奏效：把成果慢慢鎖住輝達勁敵？陸開發LightGen光子晶片 外媒：掀DeepSeek效應",

      "Content": "MoneyDJ新聞 2026-01-05 16:28:42 新聞中心 發佈\n\n美國股市上周五雖然漲跌互見，但台灣加權指數今(5)日在台積電(2330)強勢表現下，順利衝破3萬點整數大關，最高來到30,339.32點，再刷歷史新高紀錄。中國信託投信今日表示，觀察上周資金流向，台股最受外資青睞，整體買超達10.4億美元，買超金額為新興亞股之冠，其次為買超印尼1.2億美元，買超越南0.6億美元。在賣超部分，上周以印度遭外資拋售15.4億美元為最多，其次為南韓賣超3.2億美元，泰國賣超0.2億美元。\n\n在指數漲跌部分，中國信託投信指出，上周股市表現與資金流向未同步，在聖誕節及元月行情加持下，亞股普遍呈現收漲，其中，南韓上漲4.4%最多，其次為越南上漲3.2%，台股上漲2.8%，印尼上漲2.5%，而菲律賓、印度也分別小漲1.1%及0.8%，泰國則持平。\n\n台股在AI需求爆發、台積電領軍下，加權指數已順利衝破3萬大關，後續該如何觀察？中國信託台灣活力基金經理人徐啟葳表示，全球大型雲端服務供應商(Cloud Service Provider)資本支出年增率持續強勁，巨大的資本支出代表AI著算力處於供不應求的狀態，這將持續驅動整個AI供應鏈，包括電源供應、液冷散熱、高階PCB/CCL等硬體領域的結構性成長。\n\n徐啟葳指出，今(2026)年AI服務的滲透率將是觀察重點，特別是當前AI在企業端的滲透率相當低，但其一旦採用，通常是高價值、高頻率的服務，如Copilot輔助程式設計，這對服務商的自由現金流和投入資本報酬率(ROIC)將有實質貢獻，有益於股價持續維持正向。另外，對於雲端服務供應商而言，目前最大的挑戰是如何將基礎設施的滲透率轉換為足夠的收入。\n\n而AI強勁需求也催動台灣出口及投資動能，主計總處大幅上修2025年經濟成長率至7.37%，徐啟葳認為，在此高基期下，2026年經濟成長率也有3.54%，不過，隨著2025年基期墊高、大盤指數創高的情況下，預期2026年加權指數雖有機會持續表現，但成長幅度或許較2025年低，整體來說，AI仍為領盤主流，但受到世代轉換、設計轉換等影響，選股難度增加。\n\n另外，越南股市方面，中國信託越南機會基金經理人張晨瑋指出，短線市場聚焦越南政治議題，2026年第一季越南即將迎來新屆黨政領導層，根據歷史經驗，近兩次全代會閉幕後，市場普遍視為政治不確定性消除，越南股市將迎來正向行情，在全代會後的三個月、半年、一年胡志明指數皆呈現正報酬。此外，2025年12月下旬，現任總書記蘇林在中央委員會會議稱，黨內已就新屆關鍵領導層取得共識，市場普遍解讀為政權將平穩過渡，原班人馬可能續任，也給市場帶來更多信心。\n\n張晨瑋補充，從越南經濟數據顯示，2025年前11個月工業生產年增維持雙位數，同月越南製造業採購經理人指數(PMI)達53.8點，續居年內相對高位。另外，海內外有多家機構預測，2025年越南GDP成長有望達到8%目標，而2026年由公共投資作為主引擎，有望維持高速經濟成長。值得留意的是，2025年前11月越南海外直接投資已落實金額達236億美元，再度寫下近年新高，亞馬遜、日本住友等跨產業公司均表示擴大越南投資，反映外資對本地消費、製造業等多元題材興趣濃厚，越南在外資持續挹注下，將促進經濟及股市增長。",

      "Content": "繼Aletheia Capita將台積電目標價提高到2400元之後，高盛也將台積電的投資平等列入亞太區首選買進清單，目標價喊到2330元。受到外資升評激勵，台積電今天大漲90元，股價一舉突破1600元，盤中最高來到1685元漲幅逾6％，同時也帶動台股衝破3萬點大關，同創歷史新高。\n\n針對兩大外資大動作的升評表現，沈萬鈞5日在《萬鈞法人視野 WJ Capital Perspective》中指出，TPU、AWS與NVIDIA正積極爭奪台積電先進製程產能，導致出貨預估大幅變動，台積電目前的瓶頸並非「需求」，而是「物理供給」。隨著2026年先進製程產能正式浮上檯面，台積電在供給端的物理限制（如無塵室、先進封裝）下，將展現強大的稀缺價值。\n\n針對兩大外資報告內容，沈萬鈞做出了以下差異分析：\n\n沈萬鈞表示：高盛與Aletheia雖然同步看多，但在財務模型與成長動力的觀察上展現了不同的側重點。\n\n生產力推升毛利率60%成為新常態 高盛將目標價上調至2330元。其模型建立在「可實現的穩健路徑」上，預期AI GPU/ASIC需求將驅動3nm與5nm維持滿載，並加速往2nm遷移。高盛特別強調「生產力優化」與「海外廠稀釋影響低於預期」兩大關鍵，預期台積電毛利率將結構性墊高至60%以上。根據其預測，2026/2027年營收預估分別為4.772/6.109兆台幣，EPS則預計達到82.56/105.93元。\n\n先進封裝與產能翻倍的「暴力成長」 相較之下，Aletheia給出了更為激進的2400元目標價，預測2026/2027年EPS分別可達97/120元。其核心邏輯在於台積電將於2025至2028年將<5nm先進產能直接「翻倍」，並大膽將200mm舊廠轉型為先進封裝基地。Aletheia指出，先進封裝的價值密度是傳統晶圓的5～10倍，這將成為台積電除了晶圓代工外的第二具成長引擎。\n\n在資本支出（Capex）方面，兩大外資也展現不同思維。高盛預計2026～2028年總支出將超過1500億美元，反映出在無塵室約束下的有序擴張。而Aletheia則描繪了一幅更宏大的擴張地圖，預期2027年將迎來台積電史上最激進的產能擴張，年增率高達40～50%，並強調即便支出拉高，因營收（分母）成長更快，現金流仍足以支撐高配息。\n\n台積電的核心投資邏輯已不再是「AI是否有泡沫」，而是「算力與封裝需求在2027年前仍將供給完全鎖死」。沈萬鈞談到，若以高盛的路徑作為「基本假設（Base Case）」，2027年EPS站穩100元具備極高勝率；而Aletheia則提供了更具想像力的「上行情境（Upside Scenario）」，雖然需面臨產能開出與良率進程的執行風險，但先進封裝戰場的價值密度確實正在被重新定義。隨著外資法人集體上修獲利預期，台積電正帶領台股進入結構性的獲利階梯。\n\n（封面示意圖／翻攝Pixabay）\n\n更多東森財經新聞報導中國彎道超車打造EUV？ ASML執行長不忍了：落後至少8世代PC漲價潮要來了？ 華碩、聯想預告：「這天起」調漲價格台積電「3奈米量產」提前1年 對決三星2奈米",

      "Content": "【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】周一由台積電領軍，亞洲科技股表現強勢，尤其是晶片股。雖然投資人仍然擔心AI股過熱、估值過高，但顯然更害怕錯失進一步走高的機會，在資金持續湧進下，科技股再度成為亞洲主要股市「史詩級大躍進」的最大推手。\n\n華爾街大行高盛將台積電目標股價調升35%，至新台幣2330元，稱看好這家全球晶片代工龍頭未來一年營運仍將穩健成長。此外，上周五儘管美股標普500指數僅收漲0.19%，那斯達克指數更收跌0.03%，但費城半導體指數異軍突起，飆漲了4.01%，台積電ADR大漲逾5%並創下歷史新高，其先進AI晶片大客戶之一輝達收漲1.26%。\n\n受此激勵，周一，由台積電大漲5.36%領軍，台股終場上漲2.57%，收在30,105.04點，首度創下3萬點重大里程碑。台積電盤中一度漲近7%或110元，最高觸及1695元，創下史上新高。\n\n財政部政務次長暨國安基金執行秘書周一在立法院接受質詢時表示，以前覺得3萬點好像很難達到，今天就做到了，這次台股衝破3萬點，主要是關鍵產業發揮重大作用，「確實台積電貢獻很大」。但他也表示，還是希望看到更平衡的市場結構。\n\n上周末美國突襲委內瑞拉並將其總統馬杜洛（Nicolas Maduro）押送到紐約受審，但市場對此反應冷淡。\n\n包括Bruce Lu在內，高盛分析師出具報告指出，我們認為AI將成為台積電未來多年的成長引擎。Bruce Lu表示，台積電的利潤還在持續提升，儘管他預期未來三年台積電砸下1500億美元擴充產能。\n\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co.出具報告指出，就尖端半導體而言，台積電的產能決定一切。今年AI題材仍是關鍵所在，但基於「泡沫」疑慮，建議投資人聚焦「高品質標的」，而台積電正是最具代表性的個股之一。\n\n至於其他亞洲晶片股，南韓三星電子飆漲7.47%，連漲第5天，帶動周一韓股大漲超過3%，再創收盤新高。該記憶體大廠將於本周公布初估財報，這將有助於投資人判斷其近來股價大漲是否合理？\n\n日本半導體設備大廠東京威力科創（Tokyo Electron）大漲7.60%，愛德萬測試（Advantest）大漲7.84%，激勵周一日經225指數終場漲近3%。\n\n中國IC投資基金提高對中芯國際的持股，以及DeepSeek發布更具效率的AI訓練方法，中國晶片股走高。",

      "Content": "（中央社記者鍾榮峰台北2026年1月5日電）台積電 (2330) 今天盤中觸1695元、大漲110元，再創新天價，並領軍聯發科 (2454) 、記憶體族群及高價股衝鋒，帶動台股衝上3萬點，盤中大漲989.51點攻至30339.32點，創歷史新高；終場加權指數收30105.04點，大漲755.23點，收盤創史上新高，並首次站穩3萬點關卡。\n\n台股今天收盤大漲755.23點，創史上第6大漲點紀錄；單日成交值放大至新台幣7658.07億元，創台股史上第2大量，僅次於2021年5月12日的7828.25億元。\n\n此外，台股電子指數盤中最高1845.47點、終場收1828.99點，均創歷史新高，上漲3.42%；半導體指數盤中最高995.26點，終場收983.12點，也均創歷史新高，漲4.72%。今天電子股成交比重約78.7%。\n\n台積電終場收在1670元，為歷史收盤新高；台積電單日上漲85元，為單日最大上漲金額，漲幅達5.36%，對加權指數貢獻約680點；台積電今天終場市值大增2.2兆元，超過43.3兆元，續創新高。\n\n主要電子權值股聯發科收1525元，上漲3.74%；鴻海 (2317) 收234.5元，漲1.08%；台達電 (2308) 今天重返千元，終場收1010元，漲1.51%。\n\n記憶體華邦電 (2344) 收95.5元，勁揚5.18%；旺宏 (2337) 鎖漲停47.65元，南亞科 (2408) 終場收208元，漲0.48%。日月光投控 (3711) 震盪翻揚，終場收263.5元，漲2.13%；力積電 (6770) 收43.45元，漲3.21%。\n\n代表中小型股的櫃買OTC指數翻黑下挫0.85%；股價超過千元的高價股漲跌互見，台達電、印能科技重返千元，高價股首創「29千金」。\n\n台新投顧副總經理黃文清指出，台股今天首次站上3萬點，並創多項新紀錄，顯示市場對元月展望樂觀，尤其是正向看待台積電15日將舉辦的法人說明會行情，加上外資法人上調台積電目標價，帶動台積電和相關供應鏈股價衝高，催化台股攻上3萬點；相較之下，非台積電供應鏈表現疲軟。\n\n展望台股後市，黃文清指出，台股今天量能維持在7500億元至8000億元可控範圍，預期短線外資和投信仍偏多布局，留意單日成交量是否爆量超過8500億元，提防回檔訊號。（編輯：張良知）",

      "Content": "A Look At Amazon (AMZN) Valuation As AI And Cloud Growth Renew Investor Interest\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 10:10 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nRecent commentary on Amazon.com (AMZN) is centering on a pickup in its core engines, with Amazon Web Services, AI heavy digital advertising, and more efficient e-commerce operations renewing interest in the stock.\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com.\nDespite the latest 1 day and 7 day share price declines, Amazon.com’s current share price of US$226.50 sits against a three year total shareholder return of about 159%, with momentum recently softer as investors weigh AI driven growth news against valuation and insider selling headlines.\n\nIf AI, cloud and e commerce are on your radar, this could be a good moment to widen your watchlist with high growth tech and AI stocks for more potential ideas beyond Amazon.\nWith Amazon now at US$226.50, a 3 year total shareholder return near 159%, solid reported revenue and net income growth, and a flagged intrinsic discount of about 40%, key questions arise: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 3.5% Undervalued According to Zwfis, the narrative fair value of US$234.75 sits slightly above Amazon.com's last close at US$226.50, framing the stock as modestly discounted in their view.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how an 8% discount rate, double digit revenue growth and a rich future earnings multiple come together? The narrative stitches these into a single fair value roadmap that challenges the current price. Want to see which profit assumptions do the heavy lifting in that US$234.75 figure?\n\nResult: Fair Value of $234.75 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this storyline still depends on AWS growth holding up and on management turning heavy AI and infrastructure spending into profits rather than just higher costs.\nFind out about the key risks to this Amazon.com narrative.\nAnother Angle On Value So far the focus has been on fair value estimates and narrative assumptions, but the current P/E of 31.7x adds a different twist. It sits well above the global multiline retail industry at 19.4x, yet slightly below peers at 33.4x and the fair ratio of 40.4x.\nThat mix points to a market that already prices in a premium business, but not all the way up to where the fair ratio suggests sentiment might change. This leaves investors weighing whether this premium looks more like valuation risk or potential room for a rerating.\n\nStory Continues\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own Amazon.com Narrative If you see the numbers differently, or just like testing your own assumptions, you can spin up a personalized Amazon.com view in minutes: Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Amazon.com research is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards and 1 important warning sign that could impact your investment decision.\n\nLooking for more investment ideas? If you are serious about building a stronger portfolio, do not stop at one stock. Use curated stock lists to quickly spot ideas that fit your approach.\nTarget potential mispricing by reviewing these 875 undervalued stocks based on cash flows that align with your view on cash flow and price.\nBack your AI thesis with real tickers by scanning these 25 AI penny stocks that tie growth stories to actual business metrics.\nLock in potential income streams by checking these 14 dividend stocks with yields > 3% and see which payouts might suit your goals.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

That came after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its TSMC price target 35% to NT$2,330, citing expectations of another year of solid growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinkholes and Quake-Hit Roads Expose Japan’s Infrastructure Emergency\nTSMC helped lead a broad charge in Asian tech stocks Monday as investors plow more cash into the AI theme despite concerns of overheating. The sector was once again the biggest boost to regional equities as fear of missing out on further gains overcame concerns of short-term volatility in the wake of US strikes against Venezuela.\n“We view AI as a multi-year growth engine for TSMC,” Goldman analysts including Bruce Lu wrote in a report. Lu notes the company’s profit margins are improving, even as he projects it will spend $150 billion over the next three years to increase capacity.\nAmong other chip stocks, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. extended gains to a fifth-straight session. The memory maker is expected to report preliminary results later this week that will provide further clues on the whether earnings justify the sector’s big gains.\nTSMC shares surged 44% in 2025, pushing its market value above $1 trillion for the first time. That reflects increased investor confidence in its central position amid the AI boom, with many of the world’s chip companies relying on its foundry services.\n\n“For leading-edge semiconductor, capacity from TSMC is the king,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts including Mark Li wrote in a note dated Friday. This year “is still all about AI,” though the analysts recommend investors “focus on quality” given worries of a bubble.\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nOzempic Users Actually Spend More Dining Out.

      "Content": "Ready to Buy Nvidia Stock? Check Out This Option.\n\nLyle Daly, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 7:51 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's financials continue to improve.\nIts GPUs are in high demand from AI companies.\nIf you're unsure whether to load up on Nvidia stock now, another option is dollar-cost averaging -- putting smaller investments on auto-pilot.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just finished up another great year. The stock rose 39% in 2025 and looking at recent earnings reports, for the first three quarters of its 2026 fiscal year (the nine-month period ending Oct. 26, 2025), the chipmaker's revenue increased 62% year over year. Gross profit increased 48%, and net income increased 52%.\nExpectations are high for this year, especially after management revealed an order backlog of $500 billion through the end of 2026. However, Nvidia is trading at an expensive 46 times trailing earnings. With that in mind, should you buy Nvidia stock now or wait for a cheaper opportunity?\nHow to buy Nvidia shares There's a lot to like about Nvidia as an investment. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand from other AI companies, which is the primary reason its revenue has exploded. Data center revenue made up 90% of Nvidia's total revenue in its most recent quarter. It's certainly a quality company to have in your portfolio, particularly if you're looking for top AI stocks . Excellent companies often trade at high valuations, so you shouldn't let its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) dissuade you from investing.\n\nThat said, it's normal to question how much more Nvidia can grow if there is a pullback in the near future. It's the largest public company by market cap as I write this, and the valuation is high, although reasonable compared to most AI companies. For perspective, competitor Advanced Micro Devices trades at 106 times trailing earnings, making Nvidia look like a bargain in comparison.\nIf you're concerned about investing too heavily in Nvidia all at once, dollar-cost averaging is a good alternative. This mans buying a fixed amount of Nvidia stock on a schedule that works for you. For example, you could purchase one or two shares each week no matter what the stock is doing.\nI've dollar-cost averaged into many tech stocks I like, Nvidia included. It's a useful strategy for volatile stocks because even if the share price declines, you'll have the opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "（中央社記者潘姿羽台北2026年1月5日電）台股氣勢如虹，今天首度攻破3萬點大關，再創歷史新高。外界關注國安基金態度，財政部次長暨國安基金執行秘書阮清華今天於立法院財委會表示，台灣產業發展未來蠻好，國安基金尊重市場，不會壓抑台股；至於退場時間由委員會決議。\n\n2026年才剛揭開序幕，台股強勢開場，今天大漲逾800點，盤中一度站上30200點，再創歷史新高，台積電也再創新天價。\n\n國民黨立委羅明才關切台股是否能夠站穩3萬點，阮清華表示，股市很難預估，但目前AI、高速運算熱潮，台灣站在對的一方，產業發展未來蠻好。\n\n民進黨立委李坤城提醒，他樂見台股3萬點，但這當中台積電 (2330) 貢獻很大，要注意產業健康的議題，避免只是「一個人的武林」。\n\n阮清華表示，以前覺得3萬點好像很難發生，今天就發生了，這次台股衝破3萬點的原因，關鍵產業發揮重大作用，確實台積電貢獻很大。\n\n阮清華接著說，政府希望產業平衡，現在有點產業兩極化的味道，期盼透過跨部會共同努力，協助相對傳統的產業升級。\n\n羅明才指出，市場傳聞國安基金似乎有賣股，讓台股不要漲太多。阮清華表示，國安基金尊重市場機制，不會壓台股，而且今天台股已經漲超過3萬點；此外，國安基金在退場前沒有賣，即便要退場，也不會1、2天賣掉，會看市場狀況。\n\n羅明才追問國安基金何時退場，阮清華說，國安基金退場時間是由委員會決議。（編輯：張良知）",

This suggests it may be undervalued on several fronts. We will walk through what that means using different valuation approaches, before ending with a more intuitive way to think about the company’s true worth.\n\nMicrosoft delivered 12.5% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Software industry.\nApproach 1: Microsoft Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those cash flows back to today in $ terms.\nFor Microsoft, the latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is about $89.4 billion. Based on analyst forecasts and Simply Wall St’s extrapolations, free cash flow is projected to rise to roughly $369.8 billion by 2035, with intermediate steps such as around $206.2 billion by 2030. These projections assume robust growth over the next decade as Microsoft continues to scale its cloud and AI businesses.\n\nUsing a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, these future cash flows are discounted back to today to arrive at an estimated intrinsic value of about $604.22 per share. Compared to the current market price, this implies the stock is trading at roughly a 21.7% discount, suggesting the shares are materially undervalued based on cash flow potential.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Microsoft is undervalued by 21.7%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 875 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Microsoft.\nApproach 2: Microsoft Price vs Earnings For a highly profitable business like Microsoft, the price to earnings, or PE, ratio is a useful way to gauge whether the market price makes sense relative to the company’s current profit engine. Investors are generally willing to pay a higher PE for companies with stronger growth prospects and lower perceived risk, while slower growing or riskier firms usually trade on lower, more conservative multiples.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft currently trades on a PE of about 33.5x, which is slightly above the US Software industry average of roughly 31.7x and close to the peer group average of around 32.7x. To move beyond simple comparisons, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio: the PE multiple that would be reasonable given Microsoft’s earnings growth outlook, margins, size, industry and risk profile. This tailored Fair Ratio, at about 51.3x, better reflects the company’s specific strengths than a broad industry or peer average.\nComparing Microsoft’s actual PE of 33.5x to the Fair Ratio of 51.3x suggests the market is pricing the shares below what would be expected for a business of this quality and growth profile.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1464 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Microsoft Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This is a simple framework where you attach a clear story about Microsoft’s future to concrete numbers like fair value, revenue growth, earnings and margins, and then see how that story stacks up against today’s share price.\n\nA Narrative on Simply Wall St links three things together: the business story you believe, the financial forecast that follows from that story, and the resulting fair value estimate. All of this is presented in an accessible tool on the Community page that millions of investors already use.\nOnce you choose or create a Narrative, the platform continuously compares its fair value to Microsoft’s live market price to help you decide whether it looks more like a buy, hold or sell, and automatically updates that view when important news, earnings or guidance changes come in.\nFor example, one Microsoft Narrative on the Community page currently assumes a cautious outlook with fair value closer to about $360 per share, while another assumes robust AI led growth and pegs fair value above $620. This illustrates how two investors can look at the same company, plug in different expectations, and reach very different yet clearly explained conclusions.\n\nFor Microsoft, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Microsoft Narratives:\n🐂 Microsoft Bull Case\nFair value: $624.45 per share\nImplied undervaluation vs current price: approximately 24.2%\nForecast revenue growth: 15.30%\nAssumes AI partnerships and Azure expansion sustain double digit revenue growth and support a durable, high margin cloud and subscription model.\nSees cybersecurity, Microsoft 365 and other recurring subscription revenues driving predictable earnings and free cash flow.\nAccepts elevated AI and data center capex as justified by long term demand, with efficiency gains expected to keep margins broadly stable.\n🐻 Microsoft Bear Case\nFair value: $420.00 per share\nImplied overvaluation vs current price: approximately 12.7%\n\nForecast revenue growth: -0.78%\nArgues that massive AI and data center capex risks turning Microsoft into a lower return, capital intensive utility if AI pricing and demand disappoint.\nHighlights pressure from a shrinking PC market, weak Xbox hardware performance, and deteriorating Windows user experience as structural headwinds.\nWarns that AI tools like Copilot may cannibalize per seat Office revenues while partnership dependence and intensifying competition erode Microsoft’s moat.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Microsoft?

      "Content": "Exclusive-Samsung to double mobile devices powered by Google's Gemini to 800 million units this year\n\nReuters\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 7:03 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SSNLF\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSEOUL, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics plans to double this year the number of its mobile devices with AI features powered by Google's Gemini, its co-CEO said, which would give the U.S. firm an edge over rivals as the global race in artificial ​intelligence hots up.\nThe South Korean company, which had rolled out Gemini-backed AI features to about 400 million mobile products, including smartphones and tablets, ‌by last year, plans to boost that figure to 800 million in 2026.\n\n\"We will apply AI to all products, all functions, and all services as quickly as possible,\" T M Roh ‌told Reuters in his first interview since becoming Samsung Electronics co-CEO in November.\nThe plan by the world's largest backer of Google's Android mobile platform is set to give a major boost to its developer Google, which is locked in a race with OpenAI and others to attract more consumer users to their AI model.\nSamsung seeks to reclaim its lost crown from Apple in the smartphone market and fend off competition from Chinese rivals not only in mobile telephones, but televisions and home ⁠appliances, all overseen by Roh.\nIt will offer integrated AI ‌services across consumer products to widen its lead over Apple in such features, though the latter was set be the top smartphone maker last year, according to market researcher Counterpoint.\n\nAI RACE\nAlphabet's Google launched the latest version of Gemini in November, ‍highlighting Gemini 3's lead on several popular industry measures of AI model performance.\nIn response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly issued an internal \"code red,\" pausing non-core projects and redirecting teams to accelerate development. The ChatGPT maker launched its GPT-5.2 AI model a few weeks later.\nRoh expects the adoption of AI to accelerate, as Samsung's surveys on ​awareness of its Galaxy AI brand jumped to a level of 80% from about 30% in just one year.\n\"Even though the AI technology might ‌seem a bit doubtful right now, within six months to a year, these technologies will become more widespread,\" he said.\nWhile search is the most used AI feature on phones, consumers also frequently use a range of generative AI editing and productivity tools for images and others, as well as translation and summary features, he said.\n\n\"NOT IMMUNE\" TO MEMORY CHIP SHORTAGE\nA global shortage of memory chips is a boon to Samsung's mainstay semiconductor business, but pressures margins on the smartphone business, its second largest revenue source.\n\"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,\" Roh said, adding that the crisis affects not ⁠only mobile phones but other consumer electronics, from TVs to home appliances.\n\nStory Continues\nHe did not rule ​out raising product prices, saying some impact was \"inevitable\" from a surge in memory chip prices, ​but Samsung, the world’s No.1 TV maker, is working with partners on longer term strategies to minimise the impact.\nMarket researchers such as IDC and Counterpoint predict the global smartphone market will shrink next year, as the memory chip shortage threatens to drive ‍up phone prices.\n\nRoh said the market for ⁠foldable phones that Samsung pioneered in 2019 has been growing slower than expected.\nHe attributed this to the engineering complexities and lack of applications suitable for the hardware design, but expected the segment to go mainstream in the next two or three years.\nA \"very high\" rate of foldable phone ⁠users opt for the same segment for their next purchase, he said, but gave no details.\nSamsung controlled nearly two-thirds of the foldable smartphone market in the third quarter of 2025, according ‌to Counterpoint.\nBut it faces competition from Chinese companies such as Huawei, as well as Apple, expected to launch its first foldable ‌phone this year.\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Clarence Fernandez)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】周一亞洲早盤時段，已經開盤的日韓台股大漲，台股更一舉突破3萬點大關，美股指數期貨小幅走高，不畏上周末美軍「活捉」委內瑞拉總統尼馬杜洛（Nicolas Maduro）引發的動盪。\n\n目前道瓊指數期貨幾近持平，標普500指數期貨漲0.16%，那斯達克100指數期貨漲0.37%。\n\n亞股方面，受惠於美國晶片股表現強勢，台積電ADR再創新高，目前台股大漲近3%，漲破3萬點大關，再寫新里程碑。在東京，由晶片股和重工業股領軍，日經225指數暫漲2.56%，報51,630.06點。由三星電子和SK海力士飆升帶動，南韓Kospi指數大漲2.27%。\n\n上周六，在美國總統川普下令後，美軍直搗委內瑞拉首都加拉加斯（Caracas）「活捉」其總統馬杜洛夫妻，並將其押送至紐約受審。川普並表示，美國將「接管」這個全球主要產油國，直到我們能進行安全、妥善和恰如其分的交接。\n\n據報導，美國亦敦促自家石油巨頭大舉投資委內瑞拉。知情人士透露，近來白宮和國務院官員已向美國石油企業高層表示，如果他們想要獲得20年前委內瑞拉沒收資產的賠償，就應盡快重返委內瑞拉並大舉投資，以重振當地受創的石油產業。\n\n不過，美國務卿盧比歐似乎有意淡化川普的「接管」說法，稱美國將利用從對該國的石油封鎖和區域軍事部署獲得的影響力，來實現政策目標。\n\n盧比歐周日受訪時表示，這不是接管，也不是要拿下油田，而是要確保在委內瑞拉改革整個石油產業的治理之前，任何受制裁的石油都無法進出。造福委內瑞拉人民的解決之道，是讓非伊朗等國家的民間企業進入委內瑞拉投資建設相關設備。\n\n部分華爾街人士認為美國這次出手對市場的影響有限。儘管委內瑞拉擁有龐大的石油蘊藏，但其每日產量不到100萬桶，佔比不到全球產量的1% 。\n\n上周五（1月2日）、今年第一個交易日，美股道瓊指數漲0.66%，標普500指數收漲0.19%，那斯達克指數跌0.03%，費城半導體指數飆漲4.01%。\n\n就周線來看，道指收跌0.67%，標普500周跌1.03%，那指周跌1.52%。費半指數收漲2.22%，表現亮眼。\n\n本周，市場將密切關注周五發布的12月非農就業報告。根據Dow Jones所做的調查，受訪經濟學家預期12月美國就業新增5.4萬人。",

      "Content": "日期：2026年 1月 5日\n\n※盤勢分析\n\n費半大漲、雙王法說及CES題材熱，台股本周挑戰3萬大關\n\n※昨日盤勢\n\n2026年的第一個交易日，受惠中國擬在2026年向輝達採購超過200萬顆H200\n\n晶片，以及美國政府向台積電核發出口許可，准許其將美國晶片製造設備出口至\n\n中國，台積電再度創1585新天價，也順利帶動指數以29,016點紅盤開出，隨後買\n\n盤源源不絕，指數開高走高，盤中幾乎沒有太大的回檔壓力，終場大漲386點，\n\n收在29,349點，漲幅達1.33%，再度刷新歷史新高紀錄。成交量能配合擴大至\n\n6488億之上，顯示這波攻勢並非虛火，而是有實質買盤進場承接。權值股方面，\n\n台積電上漲2.26%，鴻海上漲0.65%，聯發科上漲2.80%，廣達上漲1.84%，台達電\n\n上漲3.32%。\n\n盤面強勢股，雙鍵、鈞寶、正達、華邦電、旺宏、益登、達興材料、宜特、\n\n點序、均豪、佳必琪等漲停；京元電子、南亞科、群創、華新科、志聖、力積電\n\n、華東、精確、新應材等漲幅6%以上；盤面弱勢股，美利達、金像電、川湖、南\n\n亞、大量、健策、勤誠、富世達、南俊國際等跌幅5%以上。終場台灣加權指數上\n\n漲386.21 點，以29349.81點作收，成交量為6503.13億元。觀察盤面變化，三大\n\n類股漲跌互見，電子上漲1.78%、傳產下跌0.38%、金融上漲0.23%。在次族群部\n\n份，以半導體、光電、電器電纜表現較佳，分別上漲2.34%、2.15%、1.94%。\n\n※資金動向\n\n三大法人合計買超190.63億元。其中外資買超120.18億元，投信賣超41.9億\n\n元，自營商買超112.36億元。外資買超前五大為力積電、華邦電、群創、友達、\n\n緯創；賣超前五大為南亞、玉山金、可寧衛*、亞泥、宏碁。投信買超前五大為\n\n玉山金、亞泥、中信金、宏碁、華邦電；賣超前五大為彰銀、元大金、鴻海、澗\n\n泰新、寶成。資券變化方面，融資增32.25億元，融資餘額為3466.34億元，融券\n\n增1.15萬張，融券餘額為32.54萬張。外資台指期部位，空單減少1905口，淨空\n\n單部位23154口。借券賣出金額為190.67億元。類股成交比重：電子87.18%、傳\n\n產10.34%、金融2.48%。\n\n※今日盤勢分析\n\n國際方面，美軍3日凌晨對委內瑞拉發動大規模軍事打擊，抓走委內瑞拉總\n\n統馬杜洛，並將他強行帶往美國。美國總統川普當天公開宣稱，將接管委內瑞拉\n\n，並宣布美國大型石油企業將進入委內瑞拉。此舉造成美國華盛頓、洛杉磯等\n\n105座美國城市舉行示威活動，同時，哥倫比亞宣布武裝部隊進入一級戰備狀態\n\n，以應對可能升級的局勢。國內方面，台股 2026年開紅盤繳出亮麗成績，指數\n\n收在29349.81 點，盤中與收盤雙寫歷史新高，技術線型走強，配合美股維持強\n\n勢及企業展望正向，台股有望再度放量攻高，加上美國最大國際消費性電子展\n\nCES 2026 與大立光、台積電法說本周起陸續登場，指數有望衝3萬點關卡，惟美\n\n國對委內瑞拉的黑天鵝事件，影響投資人信心，整體預估指數高檔震盪。\n\n台股後市分析如下：第一、中華經濟研究院 2 日公布去年 12 月台灣製造\n\n業PMI 指數續揚3.9 個百分點至 55.3%，不僅連續 3個月擴張，也創 2024 年\n\n6月以來最快擴張速度，且製造業未來六個月展望指數 51.0%，是 4 月美國對等\n\n關稅宣告以來，首次回報樂觀。\n\n第二、輝達（NVIDIA）台灣總部進度再傳新消息。輝達台灣總部簽約儀式可\n\n望趕在農曆年前完成。北士科的都市計畫變更案，政府預計本月將召開都市計畫\n\n審議會，待基地整合完成後，最快可在農曆年前完成簽約。台北市府規劃透過都\n\n市計畫變更，取消T17、T18基地間原有道路縫合，將兩塊基地合併，以提供更完\n\n整、具彈性的開發空間。另輝達執行長黃仁勳月底將再度來台參加台灣分公司尾\n\n牙，相關台股供應鏈有望吹起黃仁勳旋風。\n\n第三、從技術面觀察，上周五這根實體大紅K棒具有指標性意義。指數目前\n\n站在所有均線之上，呈現標準的多頭排列。KD指標與RSI指標同步向上，顯示短\n\n線動能強勁；MACD紅柱體持續放大，代表多方力道正在加速集結。在技術面毫無\n\n敗象的情況下，拉回找買點仍是目前最順勢的操作邏輯。\n\n第四、盤面資金聚焦記憶體、被動元件、台積電概念等族群，包括華邦電、\n\n旺宏、日電貿、立隆電、均豪、台特化等表現強勢。\n\n※投資策略\n\n12 月台灣製造業 PMI 55.3%、CES將在1月6日開展、大立光8日及台積電15\n\n日將舉辦法說會、勞動基金11 月單月賺1168億元、眾利多因素有望帶動台股往3\n\n萬點關卡邁進，預估指數高檔震盪盤堅；惟仍須關注美國出兵委內瑞拉後的政局\n\n變化。操作建議維持分批布局業績題材股與AI相關族群為首選，聚焦：AI概念股\n\n、台積電法說概念、材料升級或短缺概念、高速傳輸(含光傳輸)、PCB族群、電\n\n力能源相關、衛星航太、成衣製鞋及具高殖利率的金控股等族群。",

      "Content": "【財訊快報／陳孟碩】進入2026年首個交易日，美股上週五(2日)主要股指呈現漲多跌少表現。在部分大型科技股及傳統工業股領漲下，道瓊工業指數與標普500指數雙雙終結連四黑走勢，但那指小跌連五黑，為2024年12月底以來的最長長黑紀錄。晶片類股依舊是盤面大熱灶，費半大漲4%，美光抽高近11%成了領頭羊。紐約股市2日收盤時，道瓊工業指數終場上揚319.10點或0.66%，收報48,382.39點；標準普爾500指數小漲12.97點或0.19%，收在6,858.47點；以科技股為主的那斯達克指數(那指)續跌6.36點或0.03%，收在23,235.63點，創下自2024年12月26日到2025年1月3日連六黑以來最長的長黑紀錄。費城半導體指數大漲284.34點或4.01%，收在7,367.47點，向12月10日締造的史上新高7,467.49點挺進，台積電ADR抽高5.17%破頂，美光飆高10.5%最旺也破頂。反映中概股表現的金龍中國指數則受惠於百度飆漲的激勵，急揚4.38%，為2025年4月9日飆漲4.53%以來的九個月單日最旺表現，報7,859.65點為11月13日以來最高。百度成為當日中概股乃至美股市場的焦點，其美國預託證券(ADR)狂升15%，主因公司證實旗下負責AI晶片研發的子公司「崑崙芯」(Kunlunxin)已正式向香港聯交所提交上市申請。這樁分拆案預計將釋放該公司約30億美元的市場估值，進一步強化百度在AI算力領域的護城河，並帶動京東及阿里巴巴ADR分別上漲約3%與6.3%。科技類股內部呈現兩極化走勢，特別是「科技七雄」表現明顯分化。AI硬體端受惠於強勁的技術領先，輝達全日收高1.26%，受惠於GB200效能強壓對手的利多刺激；美光科技因AI需求鎖定遠期收入，股價急飆10.51%破頂；台積電ADR亦大漲5.17%創下歷史新高。與此同時，傳統權重股表現悍勇，波音大漲4.9%領漲道瓊，開拓重工與高盛各強彈4.5%與4%，賽富時下挫4.26%墊底。然而，部分軟體與電商巨頭則因漲多回吐及估值調整，開局表現相對疲軟，成為拖累那指連五黑的主因。微軟因雲端支出疑慮引發短期調整，終場下滑2.21%；亞馬遜回吐1.89%，Meta收購中國AI初創公司Manus，META上週五收低1.47%至650.41美元。此外，特斯拉因交付量數據未達預期且連兩年下滑，收跌2.59%，創下連七黑的紀錄。",

The narrative leans on measured revenue growth, resilient margins, and a future earnings multiple below many high flying chip names.\nResult: Fair Value of $191.8 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, sustained smartphone weakness or setbacks in Qualcomm’s AI and data center push could quickly challenge the upside implied in that 9.8 percent undervaluation.\nFind out about the key risks to this QUALCOMM narrative.\nAnother View: DCF Says the Stock Is Rich While the narrative based fair value points to upside, our DCF model paints a cooler picture. Qualcomm is trading around $172.98 versus an estimated fair value near $165.41. This suggests the shares are slightly overvalued and raises the question: which story should investors trust?\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out QUALCOMM for example ).

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】在全球供應鏈重組與「美國製造」政策推動之下，台積電加速擴大美國布局，但是高昂的生產成本正對獲利能力形成明顯壓力。Wccftech網站引用SemiAnalysis資料指出，台積電在美國設廠後，單位晶圓毛利率與台灣相比出現巨大落差，主因在於人力成本與晶圓折舊費用大幅攀升。\n\n根據分析師彙整的數據，台積電台灣晶圓廠每片晶圓的人力成本約1,800美元，美國晶圓廠則高達3,600美元，整整高出1倍。在晶圓折舊方面差距更為驚人，台灣廠每片晶圓折舊費用約1,500美元，美國廠卻高達7,289美元，是台灣廠的4倍以上。受此影響，台灣晶圓廠單片晶圓毛利率約62％，美國晶圓廠僅約8％，幾乎只剩八分之一。\n\n所謂晶圓折舊，指的是晶圓廠建設與設備投資在使用年限內的成本攤提。由於美國晶圓廠產能規模與產能利用率相對較低，即便採用相同製程技術，單位產出的固定成本卻必須由更少的晶圓分攤，導致每片晶圓承擔更高的「固定費用」，進一步侵蝕毛利空間。\n\n此外，美國高昂的人力成本亦成為沉重負擔。為支撐美國晶圓廠運作，台積電必須要在聘用當地員工與從台灣派遣工程師之間做出取捨。無論採取何種方式，整體用人成本皆明顯高過於台灣，成為影響營運效率的重要因素。\n\n市場人士指出，這也是台積電亞利桑那州晶圓廠近期出現獲利下滑的主要原因。在建廠成本、營運費用與折舊壓力同步放大的情況下，美國生產晶片的經濟性仍有待時間與規模放大來改善。\n\n儘管短期毛利承壓，台積電推進美國布局的戰略意義依然明確。此舉有助於分散地緣政治風險，確保關鍵客戶在不同地區都能取得穩定產能，也獲得包括輝達在內的重要客戶支持。\n\n業界普遍認為，建立具韌性的美國半導體供應鏈是一項長期工程，台積電勢必在成本與戰略之間持續權衡，但美國擴產方向短期內不會改變。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一陳穎芃／綜合外電報導)",

      "Content": "【財訊快報／魏聖峰】Nasdaq指數上週五雖然小跌，半導體股卻大漲，台積電ADR上漲5.17%、日月光ADR上漲4.72%。Nvidia股價上漲1.26%、美光科技股價上漲10.52%、超微股價上漲4.35%、應用材料股價上漲4.62%，帶動費城半導體指數上漲4.01%，道瓊、S&P 500指數上週五收小紅。從上週五美股與台股表現推測，週一台股可望持續在台積電(2330)、記憶體和大型權值電子股引領下，持續向上攻堅。2026年台股開盤後的第一個交易日表現強勁，加權指數大漲386.21點，漲幅1.33%，指數再刷新歷史新高的29363.43點。櫃買指數也上漲0.65%，盤中也再創波段新高的278.8點。台股會有如此亮眼的表現，與即將在1月8日和1月15日舉行法說會的大立光(3008)與台積電有密切關連，尤其是台積電。最近市場傳出台積電的業績持續暢旺，先進製程供不應求。為此，台積電可能會把CoWoS委外代工給封測業者，連帶帶動最近封測股表現強勁，日月光投控(3711)、京元電子(2449)的股價頻創掛牌新高。台積電從去年第三季起，每季現金股息提高到6元，下一次台積電配息會在3月17日。以台積電每年配息24元，以該公司目前股價1585元的價格來說，股息殖利率僅1.5%，已不是高配息股，但市場持續信心依然強烈，業績不斷成長，短期的3~5年內，台積電先進製程沒有競爭對手，都是台積電的利多。台積電已從去年第四季起正式啟動2奈米量產，台積電的2奈米已被蘋果和Nvidia搶購一空。台積電預估到今年底，2奈米產能可達到8~10萬片。不僅如此，市場傳出美國將放行Nvidia的H200出口到中國，也被中國科技業者搶購，這些多出來的高階晶圓需求，又會讓台積電的業績持續滿載。這就是台積電股價持強的關鍵。看起來，加權指數要攻上3萬點已經近在眼前。台積電CoWoS委外代工，除了讓封測龍頭日月光投控、京元電子業績大好外，將對整個封測股景氣都帶來新的挹注。先前股價漲幅已不小的欣銓(3264)，近期股價高檔震盪，連先前股價不會漲的精材(3374)最近都已開始從低檔強勁反彈。再來就是濕製程設備供應商的弘塑(3131)、辛耘(3583)，點膠、貼合自動化設備的萬潤(6187)，以及封裝和AOI檢測的均豪(5443)、均華(6640)、志聖(2467)、群翊(6664)以及廠務的漢唐(2404)、帆宣(6196)等公司都將受惠這項商機。老AI股經歷先前股價回檔後，最近兩個交易日逐漸轉強，這與加權指數逐漸逼近29000點有關，很多股票漲幅很大，老AI股股價仍在原地不動的話，股價反映出相對低價，吸引市場資金的青睞。神達(3706)經歷11月營收利空和甲骨文股價下跌利空洗禮後，短線股價築底後反彈。神達基本面不差，產能擴張以及幫甲骨文星際們做伺服器代工，後市營運看好。緯創(3231)集團營收超過廣達(2382)集團，緯穎(6669)的股價也築底反彈，廣達、鴻海(2317)的股價進入整理後，逐漸趨向多頭發展，都有利這些老AI股後市表現。還有記憶體股表現也是相當強勁，群聯(8299)和晶豪科(3006)公告11月自結獲利，晶豪科單月EPS 0.92元，超越2025年前三季的獲利表現。群聯11月EPS更達7.9元，激勵最近股價攻高。先前股價進入整理的華邦電(2344)和南亞科(2408)，股價上週五再創新高價。記憶體封裝廠的福懋科(8131)、先前股價漲多正里的南茂(8150)、力成(6239)上週五股價再度轉強，顯示記憶體股的多頭沒有散掉，隨時找機會再攻。國際指標股除了要觀察美光科技股價走勢外，南韓海力士與三星電子的股價變化也都會與台股記憶體相關股有高度連動關係。目前來看，台股在2026年開春後多頭氣勢相當強勁，在很多股價已創新高情況下，若股價有任何的回檔，都可能是買點。",

Discover the 22 US stocks riding the wave .\nTesla Investment Narrative Recap To own Tesla today, you have to believe it can evolve from a slowing EV manufacturer into a broader AI, autonomy and energy platform, with software and storage eventually doing more of the heavy lifting than cars. The latest delivery miss and Tesla’s loss of the EV crown to BYD directly challenge the near term automotive volume story, but do not yet change the key short term catalyst: progress on robotaxi and FSD approvals, particularly outside the U.S., or the biggest current risk of demand and margin pressure as incentives roll off.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Tesla’s record energy storage deployments and the new 500 MW / 1 GWh Matrix Renewables battery deal in the UK underline why many shareholders now watch the energy business almost as closely as vehicle deliveries. These projects show how grid storage could help offset some of the cyclicality and incentive sensitivity of car sales, even if it is still early days for energy to carry the valuation narrative.\nYet, despite this shift, investors still need to be aware that weaker EV demand and shrinking incentives could...\nRead the full narrative on Tesla (it's free!)\nTesla's narrative projects $148.1 billion revenue and $15.4 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Tesla's forecasts yield a $391.35 fair value , a 11% downside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives The 211 fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$67 to over US$2,700 per share, reflecting sharply different views on Tesla’s long term potential.

      "Content": "Veteran analyst delivers blunt 3-word take on Tesla after report\n\nMoz Farooque\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 12:13 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n“ Better than feared. ”\nThat’s the three-word verdict from Wedbush’s Dan Ives after Tesla ( TSLA ) reported its latest lackluster production and delivery numbers.\nWith most leaning bearish, Ives' take wasn’t the reaction investors were expecting.\nTesla’s delivery numbers came in behind internal targets, but landed close enough to Wall Street ’s expectations.\n\nDeliveries are under duress following the loss of the critical $7,500 U.S. tax credit, along with ongoing weakness across Europe. Still, the overall report pointed to stability instead of deterioration.\nHowever, having covered Tesla for years, this isn’t the same EV-centric company it once was.\nIves is echoing the same sentiment, saying investors are judging Tesla on more than just quarterly car deliveries, but also on AI , energy, and autonomy.\nCEO Elon Musk made that point clear on Tesla’s Q4 2024 earnings call .\nFor these reasons, we could see a new-look Tesla, with multiple AI and autonomy catalysts masking weaknesses in its core EV business.\nWhat Tesla’s Q4 numbers say At first glance, Tesla ’s Q4 and full-year 2025 production and delivery report was another headline miss.\nHere’s where the numbers actually stand.\nQ4 2025 deliveries: 418,227 vehicles , about 1.1% behind Tesla’s company-compiled analyst consensus of 422,850 and nearly 3.4% under Visible Alpha’s 432,810 estimate.\nQ4 2025 production: 434,358 vehicles , lagging Bloomberg’s cited consensus of 470,780 by about 7.7% .\nFull-year 2025 deliveries: 1,636,129 vehicles , mostly in line with Tesla’s compiled consensus of 1,640,752 and close to third-party expectations of about 1.65 million .\nFull-year 2025 production: 1,654,667 vehicles , which means Tesla produced slightly more than it delivered.\nEnergy storage (Q4): 14.2 GWh deployed , a record quarter , beating Tesla’s compiled consensus of 13.4 GWh by nearly 6% .\n\nIves sees Tesla on firm ground heading into 2026 Veteran Tesla bull Dan Ives feels the gap between production and delivery numbers was small enough to avoid raising any major red flags.\nIves also believes that Tesla faces significant challenges in achieving delivery growth again, particularly after the loss of the EV tax credit in Q3 and European headwinds.\n\nHowever, with deliveries more or less matching expectations, he feels Tesla enters 2026 in a strong position.\nRelated: Top analyst resets price target on Micron stock\nPerhaps the brightest spot is its energy business, where deployments jumped to 46.7 gigawatt-hours for the year.\nMore importantly, though, Ives reiterated the importance of AI, Full Self-Driving, Optimus robotics, and Robotaxis in 2026.\nHe keeps a buy rating on Tesla stock, with a massive $600 price target .\nFor perspective, that’s the highest rating on Wall Street.\nAnalysts stay divided on Tesla’s upside from here Tesla stock is currently trading near $438 after releasing its latest delivery report.\nThe past week has been tough for the stock (down 8%), but it capped off 2025 in the green, delivering a 16% gain .\nWhen I last covered Tesla stock (December 18, 2025), it was trading at $483.37 , so it has since declined by roughly 9.4% .\n\nRelated: Morgan Stanley drops surprising message on tech stocks\nNevertheless, it’s still trading at what bears would call a nosebleed valuation , at 268 times non-GAAP forward earnings .\nThat said, here’s where the big banks and major analysts are pegging the stock right now.\nDeutsche Bank : $500 price target (+14%) — stays buy, leaning into the Robotaxi/AI narrative.\nBofA Securities : $471 price target (+8%) — raised target but kept a neutral stance, calling Tesla the “physical AI” leader while raising concerns over its valuation. Source: Investing.com\nGoldman Sachs : $420 price target (-4%) — nudged its target higher, but it’s still sitting below the tape.\nMorgan Stanley : $425 price target (-3%) — equal weight, with Robotaxi framed as the key catalyst for the first half of 2026. Source: Investing.com\nUBS : $247 price target (-44%) — sell, arguing the stock’s pricing in too much autonomy upside too soon. Source: Investing.com\n\nA choppy year put Tesla’s Q4 in context Tesla ’s 2025 delivery story has been anything but smooth.\nThe year 2025 began with a major stumble, as Tesla’s Q1 deliveries slid to 336,681 , primarily due to Model Y line changeovers, effectively sidelining production for weeks.\nQ2 brought improvement with 384,122 deliveries, but it still felt more like grinding progress than a real comeback.\n\nMore Tesla:\nTop-rated analyst drops curt 8-word take on Tesla stock\nTesla investors may miss game-changing move\nJudge orders Tesla to make major change or halt sales in California\nRivian doubles down on new plan to beat Tesla\nQ3 then changed the tone with deliveries surging to 497,099 , turning into Tesla’s best quarter of last year, driven mainly by customers rushing to access the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit before it expired.\nAdditionally, the competition only adds to the current context.\nChinese EV giant BYD yet again ended last year emphatically, selling 4.6 million vehicles , which includes nearly 2.26 million battery EVs , The Guardian reported, blowing past Tesla’s 1.64 million haul .\nMoreover, rivals including Geely , NIO , and Li Auto also posted impressive late-year numbers, highlighting the unforgiving nature of the EV landscape for Tesla.\nRelated: Analyst who nailed 2020 lows drops take on S&P 500\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 4, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Is Apple’s Valuation Still Justified After AI Push and Recent Share Price Drop?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 12:11 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nWondering if Apple still looks attractive at today's levels, or if most of the upside has already been realized? This breakdown will help you decide whether the current price really matches the story.\nDespite dipping around 0.9% over the last week and 2.8% over the past month, Apple is still up 11.9% over the last year and 112.2% over three years. This shows that long term holders have been well rewarded even as short term sentiment has wobbled.\nRecent headlines have focused on Apple's ongoing push into AI features across its devices and ecosystem, along with regulatory scrutiny around its App Store practices and broader tech competition. Together, these themes help explain why the market has been periodically reassessing both Apple's potential growth and its risk profile.\nRight now, Apple scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks , suggesting the stock only screens as undervalued on one of six measures. Next, we will unpack the popular valuation approaches investors rely on, and then finish with a more nuanced way to think about what Apple might really be worth.\n\nApple scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Apple Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future, then discounting those cash flows back to today in $ terms.\nFor Apple, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $99.9 billion. Analysts and the model expect this to rise steadily, with projected Free Cash Flow of around $184.1 billion by 2030. Near term projections are based on analyst estimates, while later years are extrapolated using Simply Wall St assumptions to create a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of roughly $223.60 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies Apple is about 21.2% overvalued on this metric. This suggests the market is paying a premium to the model’s cash flow based estimate.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Apple may be overvalued by 21.2%. Discover 875 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Apple.\nApproach 2: Apple Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Apple, the Price to Earnings ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are willing to pay today for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or greater uncertainty should translate into a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nStory Continues\nApple currently trades on a PE of about 35.8x. That is well above the broader Tech industry average of roughly 23.0x, and also a premium to its peer group, which sits around 33.0x. On the surface, that suggests investors are paying up for Apple relative to both its sector and close comparables.\nSimply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework estimates that, given Apple’s growth profile, profit margins, size and risk factors, a more appropriate PE would be closer to 37.7x. This Fair Ratio is more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it explicitly bakes in company specific fundamentals instead of assuming all tech stocks deserve the same multiple. Since Apple’s actual PE of 35.8x is slightly below this 37.7x Fair Ratio, the shares appear modestly undervalued on this metric.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1464 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Apple Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to attach your story about Apple to the numbers by setting your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins, and a fair value estimate. A Narrative connects three pieces together: the business story you believe, the financial forecast that flows from it, and the fair value that drops out at the end. On Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page used by millions of investors, where you can quickly choose or adjust a Narrative instead of rebuilding a model from scratch. Narratives can then help you decide whether to buy, hold, or sell by comparing your Fair Value to today’s share price, and they update dynamically as new earnings, news, or guidance arrive so your view does not go stale. For example, some Apple Narratives currently see fair value near $177, while others are closer to $287, reflecting how cautious and optimistic investors can look at the same company and still reach very different, but clearly quantified, conclusions.\n\nFor Apple however we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Apple Narratives:\n🐂 Apple Bull Case\nFair value: $275.00\nImplied undervaluation vs last close: approximately -2.9%\nRevenue growth assumption: 12.78%\nSees the recent near 35% share price drop as an overreaction to steep U.S. tariffs on China assembled iPhones, with Apple actively shifting production to India and Vietnam and pursuing exemptions.\nHighlights resilient fundamentals, including Q1 2025 profit of $36.33 billion that beat expectations and record $26.3 billion services revenue, alongside a \"Moderate Buy\" analyst consensus and a mean target of $251.72.\nArgues that AI investments, strong brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams position Apple for long term recovery and growth despite short term geopolitical and supply chain volatility.\n\n🐻 Apple Bear Case\nFair value: $177.34\nImplied overvaluation vs last close: approximately 52.9%\nRevenue growth assumption: 14.68%\nViews Apple as significantly overvalued, pointing to a P/E multiple well above the market given moderating growth and maturing product lines, especially the iPhone.\nFlags slowing hardware momentum, margin pressure from rising costs and lower priced products, and heavy dependence on China amid intensifying local competition and geopolitical risk.\nArgues that large cash reserves are not being deployed aggressively into transformative innovation, so the market's optimism and lofty valuation leave the stock vulnerable to a correction.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Apple?

      "Content": "在全球供應鏈重組與「美國製造」政策推動之下，台積電加速擴大美國布局，但是高昂的生產成本正對獲利能力形成明顯壓力。Wccftech網站引用SemiAnalysis資料指出，台積電在美國設廠後，單位晶圓毛利率與台灣相比出現巨大落差，主因在於人力成本與晶圓折舊費用大幅攀升。\n\n根據分析師彙整的數據，台積電台灣晶圓廠每片晶圓的人力成本約1,800美元，美國晶圓廠則高達3,600美元，整整高出1倍。在晶圓折舊方面差距更為驚人，台灣廠每片晶圓折舊費用約1,500美元，美國廠卻高達7,289美元，是台灣廠的4倍以上。受此影響，台灣晶圓廠單片晶圓毛利率約62％，美國晶圓廠僅約8％，幾乎只剩八分之一。\n\n所謂晶圓折舊，指的是晶圓廠建設與設備投資在使用年限內的成本攤提。由於美國晶圓廠產能規模與產能利用率相對較低，即便採用相同製程技術，單位產出的固定成本卻必須由更少的晶圓分攤，導致每片晶圓承擔更高的「固定費用」，進一步侵蝕毛利空間。\n\n此外，美國高昂的人力成本亦成為沉重負擔。為支撐美國晶圓廠運作，台積電必須要在聘用當地員工與從台灣派遣工程師之間做出取捨。無論採取何種方式，整體用人成本皆明顯高過於台灣，成為影響營運效率的重要因素。\n\n市場人士指出，這也是台積電亞利桑那州晶圓廠近期出現獲利下滑的主要原因。在建廠成本、營運費用與折舊壓力同步放大的情況下，美國生產晶片的經濟性仍有待時間與規模放大來改善。\n\n儘管短期毛利承壓，台積電推進美國布局的戰略意義依然明確。此舉有助於分散地緣政治風險，確保關鍵客戶在不同地區都能取得穩定產能，也獲得包括輝達在內的重要客戶支持。\n\n業界普遍認為，建立具韌性的美國半導體供應鏈是一項長期工程，台積電勢必在成本與戰略之間持續權衡，但美國擴產方向短期內不會改變。\n\n更多工商時報報導台股基金夯 19檔淨值破百元欣興董座：載板樂觀到2026養地怎麼認定？ 動工合理期間出爐",

      "Content": "4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points AI hyperscalers are ramping up their spending.\nThe stock is reasonably valued compared to its big tech peers.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the top stocks to own in 2025, marking the third straight year in which Nvidia outperformed the market. That's an impressive run, and I have no reason to doubt that Nvidia will continue that streak heading into 2026.\nEven after its 38% rise in 2025, I think Nvidia is still a top buy for 2026. I've got a handful of reasons why Nvidia is still a top buy now, and investors who don't have enough exposure to the top growth stock in the market should consider them as a reason to buy more.\n1. AI spending isn't slowing down After three years of artificial intelligence spending increasing, 2026 appears to be another year of growth. All the AI hyperscalers have informed investors that they should expect higher capital expenditures in 2026 than in 2025. Several companies benefit from these higher spending amounts, and Nvidia is one of them.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms told investors during its Q3 earnings announcement that its \"capital expenditures dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025.\" In 2024, Meta spent $39 billion on capital expenditures. For 2025, it expects full-year capital expenditures to be around $70 billion to $72 billion. If Meta continues this acceleration, it's reasonable to expect its AI spending to reach $100 billion by 2026.\nWhile Meta isn't spending all of that money on Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) , a decent chunk will be heading Nvidia's way. This same story can be repeated for practically any AI company, making Nvidia a strong candidate to own in 2026.\n2. 2026 isn't going to be the last year of AI growth This won't be the last year we see strong AI growth. Data centers take a considerable amount of time to build, and many of the plans announced in 2025 won't be fully operational for several years. This means that they won't be purchasing Nvidia chips for a few years, so the AI growth trend will stretch out beyond 2026. That's why Nvidia has informed investors that it expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.\n\nWith multiple years of AI growth expected, Nvidia is a great stock to buy and hold.\n3. Nvidia isn't as expensive as you may think There is a common misconception in the market that Nvidia's stock is overvalued. However, when you factor in the growth Nvidia is expected to deliver, this argument breaks down quickly. Nvidia trades for about 25 times fiscal year 2027's (ending January 2027) earnings.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's right in line with where other big tech companies trade, yet they don't have the great long-term prospects Nvidia does.\n4. Nvidia doesn't have the capacity to meet demand The massive AI demand for advanced chips has consumed all of Nvidia's production capacity. During its earnings call for the fiscal 2026 third quarter, Nvidia informed investors that it is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. When demand outpaces supply, that allows Nvidia to maintain its high margins and also control the supply of chips. Although alternatives are starting to emerge as real competition for Nvidia, it's still at the top of the AI food chain.\n\nNvidia is working as hard as it can to increase capacity to meet demand for its products, but just because you hear about an AI hyperscaler creating its own chips doesn't mean it's completely shifting away from Nvidia's technology.\nNvidia is still the top name in AI computing, and with AI spending expected to continue rising over the next few years, Nvidia is an excellent stock to buy hand over fist.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

      "Content": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 7:07 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has been down over the past few months.\nIt continues to have a dominant position in AI, and it's rolling out new products to keep it.\nNvidia is facing competition from a growing number of AI tech companies.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIs Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) finally slowing down? The artificial intelligence (AI) giant ended 2025 on a high note, up 39%. However, it's down about 7% from its highs at the end of October, when it became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap .\nCan it get back there? And does it still offer value for investors from this level? Let's see where it could be a year from now.\nNew products, rising competition Nvidia plays a central role in AI development. Its product line, including its various graphics processing units (GPU) and CUDA software, are relied upon by its many high-profile clients like Amazon and Microsoft .\nAI is a fast-moving and rapidly changing industry, and Nvidia continues to roll out innovative technology and new products to provide the necessary power for its clients to process data. Data centers are one of its biggest growth drivers today, and it keeps bringing out new graphics processing units (GPU) with more processing power to handle greater data loads. It's also rolling out many vertically integrated solutions that keep clients within its ecosystem. That protects it to some degree from the onslaught of new competition in the space. As a high-growth industry, there's no shortage of companies trying to develop more sophisticated AI technology.\n\nThat brings us to where Nvidia could be in a year. Considering its dominance and innovation, I don't envision it slowing down and losing ground just yet. So while new competition could eventually put a dent in its growth, it may take a while to make a big impact. At the same time, it looks like the market is already pricing in these worries into the stock's cost. As long as the AI market continues to grow, Nvidia is likely to follow suit, albeit at a slower pace than in the past.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Yes.\n00:02 Speaker B\nYou know, they they lost their way on on movies a long, long time ago. Their their television unit's actually quite good. Um the gaming unit has gone all in on on selling more consoles. And Microsoft by kind of pulling away from the console business, um gave Sony an opening to not cut price. So, you know, here we are, uh what, five full years into the launch of the PlayStation uh 5 and prices are higher than the launch price. Now, obviously, some of that is due to Trump, but, you know, tariffs. But um you this is just unprecedented that we haven't seen console prices decline. So Sony's selling a kind of a weak number of consoles, but they think they're winning because Microsoft's selling virtually none. Um I think the console business is going away. Um it'll it'll be a niche business like 3D televisions. There'll still be people who buy them like turntables for for listening to music. There are people who will buy them. But ultimately, we're going to get everything, you know, on connected TV and Sony is just not part of that. Their acquisition strategy has been downright stupid. Uh they bought Bungie for $3.6 billion dollars. You know, and just to compare and contrast that EA bought uh Vince Zampella, the late Vince Zampella's Titanfall maker respawn for 450 million. So Sony is just ridiculously overpaying for things. Uh Bungie's produced nothing that has worked. Uh the console business is dying and they don't have a backup plan.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "With 81% ownership in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:SIMO), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 6:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nKey Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Silicon Motion Technology's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nThe top 18 shareholders own 51% of the company\nOwnership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nEvery investor in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation ( NASDAQ:SIMO ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nLast week’s 3.9% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 75% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Silicon Motion Technology, beginning with the chart below.\nView our latest analysis for Silicon Motion Technology\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Silicon Motion Technology? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Silicon Motion Technology. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Silicon Motion Technology's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Silicon Motion Technology. FMR LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 10.0% of shares outstanding. Reinhart Partners, LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 4.4% of common stock, and Acadian Asset Management LLC holds about 3.8% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Chia-Chang Kou, the CEO has 1.4% of the shares allocated to their name.\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of Silicon Motion Technology The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$100m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Silicon Motion Technology. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nNext Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

      "Content": "Tesla Stock Has Been Flat For 2 Months - How to Make a 3.2% Yield in One-Month Puts\n\nMark R. Hake, CFA\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 6:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla, Inc. ( TSLA ) stock has been flat over the last 2 months. But investors are making money by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options. For example, over the next month, Tesla put options with exercise prices 6.4% lower than today's price provide a 3.2% income yield.\nTSLA closed at $438.07 on Friday, Jan. 2, 2026. That is about where it was on Nov. 6, 2025, when it closed at $445.91. However, some investors have made money by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options (and OTM calls).\n\nMore News from Barchart The Saturday Spread: How Basketball Analytics May Help Extract Alpha (CPNG, DBX, BBY)\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nMaking Money with Out-of-the-Money Xash-Secured Put Sales For example, I discussed this in a Dec. 2, 2025, Barchart article, “ Tesla Stock Has Been Flat - Good for Shorting Puts to Make a One-Month 2.5% Yield .”\nI demonstrated how an investor could earn $1,068 on December 2, 2026, by securing $40,500 in collateral with their brokerage firm for a put that expired on January 2, 2026.\n\nThat was a cash-secured short-put play for investors, giving them an immediate 2.637% one-month yield (i.e., $10.68/$405.00). In return, the investors had an obligation to buy 100 shares with the collateral at $405.00, if TSLA stock fell by 5.6% to that price on or before Jan. 2, 2026.\nSince TSLA closed at $438.07, this obligation expired, and the investors made a clean 2.64% one-month yield. (By the way, TSLA rose from $430.46 to $438.07 over the last month, or just +1.77% - so shorting OTM puts was a better play).\nTherefore, it now makes sense to repeat this short put play.\nShorting TSLA Puts Over the Next Month For example, look at the Feb. 6, 2026, expiration TSLA put option chain. It shows that the $410 exercise price put option contract has a midpoint premium of $13.23.\nAn investor can earn an immediate yield of 3.226% (i.e., $13.23/$410.00) for an obligation to buy 100 shares at $410, i.e., 6.4% below Friday's close.\nIn other words, by securing $41,000 with their brokerage firm, the investor who enters an order to “Sell to Open” 1 put contract at $410 expiring Feb. 6, immediately collects $1,323.00 .\nMoreover, even if TSLA falls to $410 on or before Feb. 6, 2026, the investor's net cost, i.e., the breakeven (B/E) point, is below $400 per share:\n$410.00 - $13.23 income received = $396.77 B/E\nIn other words, this is a good way to set a potential lower buy-in point. That B/E is $41.30 below Friday's close at $438.07 , or a downside protection of 9.4%\n\nStory Continues\nThat seems like a good way for existing investors to make extra income, plus potentially lower their average cost in TSLA stock.\nFor new investors, it also sets a lower buy-in point but provides income while waiting.\nRisks and How to Handle Them Nevertheless, it could result in an unrealized loss if TSLA falls below $410 and the puts are assigned to buy 100 shares with the cash-secured collateral. For example, if TSLA falls to $396.00, the investor would have a net unrealized loss, as it would be below the B/E point.\nHowever, all would not be lost. Don't forget that by doing successive one-month short-put plays, the investor builds up income. For example, over the last two months, an investor would have gained $1,068 + $1,323, or $2,391, or $23.91 per put contract shorted.\n\nThat means that the net breakeven is now $410-$23.91, or $386.09. That's 11.9% below today's price.\nMoreover, even after having an assignment, the investor now owns 100 shares of TSLA. They have not sold anything. That means they could sell out-of-the-money (OTM) covered calls over the next month. This would help defray any potential unrealized loss - again without selling any TSLA shares.\nThe bottom line is that if TSLA stock stays flat over the next several months, it makes sense to take advantage of the high put option premiums.\nShorting one or two-month out-of-the-money put options provides good income and a potentially lower buy-in point.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Buy in January That Could Join Nvidia in the $1 Trillion Club by 2030\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 5:29 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nORCL\n\nV\n\nXOM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Visa and ExxonMobil are highly efficient businesses that return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nOracle is a high-risk, high-potential-reward bet on increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nNetflix deserves a premium valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Visa ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ended 2025 as the most valuable company in the world. It is one of nine S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stocks with market capitalizations exceeding $1 trillion -- the others being Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Broadcom , Tesla , and Berkshire Hathaway .\nEli Lilly , Walmart , and JPMorgan Chase only need to rise 14% or less to expand the list to 12 companies.\nHere's why Visa (NYSE: V) , ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) , and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) have what it takes to be winning investments over the next five years and join the $1 trillion club by 2030.\n1. Visa Visa's path to $1 trillion is fairly straightforward. The payment processor has high margins, a reasonable valuation , and steady earnings growth, and returns tons of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nVisa can generate high single-digit or double-digit earnings growth even during challenging periods.\nDespite slowdowns in consumer spending, Visa grew non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) earnings per share by 14% in 2025. If Visa can maintain that growth rate going forward, it could reach a market cap well beyond $1 trillion by 2030.\n\n2. ExxonMobil ExxonMobil will need to double in five years to surpass $1 trillion in market cap. It absolutely has what it takes.\nExxonMobil is generating gobs of free cash flow (FCF) and high earnings, even though oil prices are hovering around four-year lows. It has reduced its production costs and can break even at low oil prices, and has plenty of upside potential during a higher-price environment. It also has a growing low-carbon business and a massive refining and marketing segment.\n\nExxonMobil's corporate plan through 2030 forecasts double-digit earnings growth even if oil and gas prices are mediocre. Although the U.S. Energy Information Administration is only forecasting $55 per Brent crude oil barrel in 2026, oil prices could rise in the coming years due to economic demand fueled by artificial intelligence (AI), as well as overall economic growth and geopolitical tensions.\nEither way, ExxonMobil doesn't need a lot of help from oil prices to grow earnings at a solid pace. A 15% annual growth rate, compounded over five years, would double earnings. Given the stock's reasonable volatility, it could double as well, pole-vaulting ExxonMobil over the $1 trillion bar.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the meantime, ExxonMobil investors will benefit from its stable and growing 3.4% dividend, which ExxonMobil has increased for 43 consecutive years.\n3. Oracle Oracle almost surpassed $1 trillion in market cap in September before falling over 40% from that high due to concerns about its AI spending and mounting debt.\nOracle is ramping up spending to build out data center infrastructure to grow its cloud computing market share, especially for high-performance computing workflows. It exited its most recent quarter with $523 billion in remaining performance obligations, signaling demand is high for its infrastructure. But Oracle needs to convert capital expenditures into earnings. In the meantime, it is FCF negative, making Oracle a leveraged bet on increased AI adoption.\n\nDespite its risks, Oracle's potential is impossible to ignore. Oracle is a great buy for investors who agree that its aggressive AI investments are the right long-term move and are willing to endure what will likely be a highly volatile period in the stock price.\n4. Netflix Over the last six months, Netflix's market cap has slipped from over $560 billion to under $400 billion due to a mix of valuation concerns and uncertainties regarding its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) . Netflix will probably receive regulatory approval for the acquisition, but still faces challenges from Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ: PSKY) , which is attempting a hostile takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nBut with or without Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix has what it takes to steadily grow earnings through a combination of global subscriber growth and pricing power. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, it could create a highly lucrative top-tier streaming platform that features content from both Netflix and HBO, as well as a revamped ad-supported tier.\nEven without HBO, Netflix has mastered the art of aligning content spending with steady subscription revenues, thanks to its depth and breadth of content -- from building global franchises from scratch like Stranger Things , to the success of KPop Demon Hunters.\nNetflix has already demonstrated impeccable pricing power with multiple price increases in a relatively short amount of time and a crackdown on password sharing that was largely accepted by users -- even during a period when people are pulling back on discretionary spending. So even if it doesn't quite crack the $1 trillion club, I still fully expect Netflix to be a winning investment and outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years.\n\nStart the new year off right with these top stocks With the broader indexes around all-time highs, it's easy to get enamored by the companies that could surge in value in the coming months or in 2026. But a far more rewarding approach is to invest in companies that have what it takes to compound in value over the long term.\nVisa, ExxonMobil, Oracle, and Netflix certainly fit that mold. That's why I expect all four stocks to outperform the S&P 500 and join the $1 trillion club over the next five years, even though they are currently far from reaching that milestone.\n\nShould you buy stock in Visa right now? Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

I wrote a story yesterday on Yahoo Finance saying laying out why the stock could rise 50% next year. I got a lot of uh, let's say negative feedback on that. Very important, I wasn't making this call. I was just laying out the reasons why it could happen. Am I out of my mind here?\n00:22 Speaker B\nWelcome to the investment business.\n00:25 Speaker B\nUm no, I saw it and I do agree. I think there are a number it it's been a laggard. Uh they delivered robust earnings. I mean, really a massive earnings beat last quarter. Um the AWS business is very mature but still growing at 20%. and they and they offered this tidbit that I didn't see many people talk about and that is that October growth in that business was bigger than the whole third quarter. So, I I wouldn't underestimate them. Traium is at full capacity and uh has a backlog and it's a stock that's trading at a peg of 1.4 times. If you go back and look at the S&P historically, it's traded at a peg of 1.5 to two times. Um so I think this company is fairly valued um and has the ability to deliver not just robust earnings growth, but free cash flow is going to increase next year to levels we haven't seen in five years.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】台股新年報喜，加權指數2日帶頭創高，衝過29,000點整數關卡之上，美科技股同步繳出亮眼成績。法人看好即將登場的CES展、台積電15日法說，以及月底Fed利率決策會議最新動向，成為「多頭三把火」，可望帶動買盤持續回補，點亮台股元月行情。\n\n萬寶投顧總監蔡明彰表示，台股1月將關注三大事。第一是美國CES展，輝達、AMD等AI股表現為關注重點。其次，台積電法說預計將釋出去年第四季強勁財報，而29日為Fed今年首次利率決策會議，雖受經濟數據影響，降息機率降低，但美股2025歲末已提前反應，市場預期在川普影響下，Fed可能採取更為激進的降息步調，對資金動能有所挹注。\n\n富邦投顧分析，CES 2026展於6至9日舉辦，輝達與AMD都將發表專題演講。CES雖然是以消費電子為主的展覽，今年主軸可說是「AI Everywhere」，未來AI不再只是雲端上的大模型，而是直接內建於PC、手機、汽車、家電中，具身智慧（Embodied AI）讓機器人能感知物理世界並進行互動，也是本屆最大亮點，預料將帶給投資市場對於AI未來發展更大的想像空間。\n\n整體來看，預期AI發展由基礎建設轉向全面商用，台灣半導體、PCB、散熱及組裝廠實質受惠，AI Agent驅動企業端與消費端換機潮，台股在AI產業競爭力強，預料將是國際資金配置亞太市場首選，支撐台股向上。\n\n台積電法說前夕「未演先轟動」，市值已登上全球第六大。群益投顧研究部副總裁曾炎裕認為，15日法說重點關注台積電資本支出將挑戰新高，市場共識是420億～450億美元，部分法人喊上500億美元，主因是N2量產進度優於預期及AI需求。\n\n此外，A16製程預計2026年下半年進入量產導入超級電軌（Super Power Rail）技術，需大量採購新一代曝光機與晶圓處理設備，台積電擴充CoWoS、SoIC能支應輝達及CSP的AI晶片需求，有望帶動周邊供應鏈業績。\n\n不過，蔡明彰也提醒，就技術面觀察，大盤月線K值已來到94％高檔位置，對比2025年年初也曾出現同樣情況，而後就遇到DeekSeek橫空出世及川普對等關稅兩大利空衝擊，今年仍需提防首季出現修正可能。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一陳昱光／台北報導)",

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】上周五是2026年的第一個交易日，台股大盤不負眾望，直接跨越29,000點大關，這種氣勢如虹的表現，不僅宣示多頭架構的延續，更為今年的台股行情定下了「強者恆強」的基調。統一投顧分析師陳立委新一周選入旺宏（2337）、益登（3048）、光頡（3624）、欣興（3037）、惠特（6706）。\n\n受惠台積電法說會前樂觀氛圍及產業重磅利多加持，上周五加權指數以29,016點紅盤開出，隨後買盤源源不絕，指數開高走高，盤中幾乎沒有太大回檔壓力，終場大漲386點，收在29,349點，漲幅達1.33％，再度刷新歷史新高紀錄。成交量能配合擴大至6,488億元之上，顯示這波攻勢並非虛火，而是有實質買盤進場承接。\n\n推動大盤再創高峰的動力，主要來自半導體與AI產業鏈強力利多。市場傳出中國為加速AI布局，擬在2026年向輝達採購超過200萬顆H200晶片，這項消息含金量極高。與此同時，美國向台積電核發出口許可，准許其將美國晶片製造設備出口至中國，這讓半導體設備族群吃下定心丸。\n\n全球矚目的CES消費電子展即將在1/6登場，AI PC、AI眼鏡以及各類邊緣運算應用將是展場焦點；此外，光學鏡頭龍頭大立光將於8日召開法說會，護國神山台積電則在15日接棒。市場預期在先進製程產能滿載及CoWoS擴產順利的背景下，法說會將釋出正向展望。\n\n從技術面來看，上周五這根實體大紅K棒具有指標性意義。指數目前穩穩站在所有均線之上，呈現標準的多頭排列。KD指標與RSI指標同步向上，顯示短線動能強勁；MACD紅柱體持續放大，代表多方力道正在加速集結。在技術面毫無敗象的情況下，拉回找買點仍是目前最順勢的操作邏輯。\n\n中國亦傳出開發出名為 LightGen的光子晶片，試圖在運算效能上挑戰輝達，這顯示美中科技戰將進入新一輪技術軍備競賽，長線可能對現有供應鏈版圖產生微妙變化。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一陳昱光／台北報導)",

      "Content": "Is This a Rare Buying Opportunity for Amazon Stock?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 10:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon has multiple high-growth business segments, despite low stock returns in 2025.\nThis mismatch presents a buying opportunity, especially as Amazon continues to harness artificial intelligence.\nAmazon's online ads are boosting margins while catching up to Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a reliable long-term performer, but the growth stock didn't have a spectacular 2025. The growth stock only gained 5% despite strong financial results throughout the year, and this mismatch makes Amazon look promising.\nIt has made great strides in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), four industries that are poised for long-term growth. That's enough to warrant a closer look, and when you dig into recent results, Amazon's stock seems undervalued at current levels.\nOnline ads can boost margins Amazon's margins have received a massive boost in recent years as its business diversifies beyond online retail. While Amazon Web Services has taken center stage in the company's long-term plans, investors should also consider the growth in Amazon's online advertising segment.\nThat part of the business was up by 24% year over year in Q3, reaching $17.7 billion. Although ad revenue is a little less than 10% of Amazon's total revenue, it is a high-margin business. Amazon is also competing with tech giants Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) with online ads. Meta Platforms earned $51.2 billion in Q3, while Alphabet brought in $65.9 billion from ads.\n\nAmazon's ad business is catching up to the two adtech leaders. It's still growing at a great pace despite the one-year stock gains not reflecting that.\nArtificial intelligence enables multiple tailwinds While some AI stocks are speculative, Amazon is already making money with this technology. Amazon Web Services revenue growth has accelerated and achieved a 20% year-over-year growth rate, returning to 2022 growth levels, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\nArtificial intelligence requires more cloud computing, and that has resulted in more companies turning to Amazon Web Services. Amazon's cloud platform also lets businesses build AI agents.\n\nAmazon is also using internal Trainium2 chips to power parts of its cloud platform. Trainium2 AI chips can reduce Amazon's chip costs, making it easier for the company to expand its AI presence. These same AI chips are generating strong demand and can become another valuable segment under Amazon's corporate umbrella. For instance, Trainium2 AI chips grew by 150% sequentially and are now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is also using AI to enhance its offerings, such as its online marketplace. AI lets Amazon present personalized product recommendations and display ads that are more likely to get clicks.\nThe tech giant's stock price movements over the past year do not reflect the quality of the business. Amazon's overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year in Q3, while net income rose by 38% year-over-year. Both of those rates are higher than the stock's one-year return, which may set the stage for a 2026 rally.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】2026年初，全球科技股將迎來兩個高度關鍵事件：美國拉斯維加斯的CES消費電子展，以及台積電1月法人說明會。前者代表終端需求與應用場景的最新風向，後者則是半導體供給端與資本支出循環的核心指標。在AI投資主軸仍然清晰的背景下，這兩項事件有望協助市場從短期題材修正回到基本面，並引導資金重新聚焦在具備結構性成長與出貨能見度的受惠族群。\n\n從CES展的角度來看，2026年的最大特色在於市場不再單純為「AI 能做什麼」買單，而是開始檢驗「AI是否真的能被穩定使用」。無論是智慧家居、穿戴裝置或機器人，展會訊息顯示，廠商正試圖以續航時間、即時反應與隱私保護等實際體驗，說服消費者與企業端加快採用。對投資人而言，CES的價值不在於單一明星產品，而在於平台化與生態系是否成形，以及量產與上市時程是否同步揭露。\n\n值得注意的是，本屆CES的另一條隱性主線，落在「端側AI的基礎建設」。隨著AI功能逐步下放至終端設備，對高效率電源管理、感測器融合、記憶體頻寬與高速介面的需求同步上升。這類需求雖不如終端產品吸睛，卻直接影響整體使用體驗與成本結構。若展後能看到OEM與平台商在規格與供應鏈選擇上趨於一致，將有助於相關零組件供應商取得較長期的訂單能見度，也更容易被資本市場視為「可投資的成長題材」。\n\n機器人與Physical AI仍是CES最具想像空間的板塊，但同時也是市場最謹慎看待的領域。投資焦點已從舞台展示轉向實際任務的穩健度與商業可行性，尤其是在非受控環境下的安全性與長期維護成本。若主流平台能在展期或展後釋出清楚的SDK、生態夥伴與應用案例，相關的致動器、視覺感測、邊緣運算與工業電腦供應鏈，才有機會從題材性評價，轉為基本面驅動。\n\n然而，CES所釋出的需求訊號，最終仍需上游供應鏈的產能與技術配合，這也使得台積電1月法說成為市場更關鍵的定錨點。2026年初法說會的重心，將不只是單季營運表現，而是資本支出規模、先進製程擴產節奏，以及先進封裝是否持續放量。\n\n隨著AI應用由雲端延伸至邊緣，晶片設計對能效與異質整合的依賴程度提高，台積電在2nm製程與CoWoS、SoIC等封裝技術上的布局，直接影響整條供應鏈的投資信心。\n\n市場普遍預期，2026年台積電資本支出將由2025年的400～420億美元提高至500億美元，重點放在3nm擴產、2nm量產爬坡以及先進封裝產能擴張。\n\n由於CoWoS仍是AI晶片的關鍵瓶頸，任何關於產能提升、良率改善與交期穩定的說法，都可能成為資金重新布局封裝測試與材料族群的重要催化劑。即便海外新廠與新節點初期可能壓抑短期毛利，但只要定價能力與長期毛利率目標維持不變，市場對先進製程的估值邏輯仍將站得住腳。整體而言，CES與台積電法說形成了需求端與供給端的雙重驗證。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一凱基投顧董事長朱晏民)",

      "Content": "【時報記者張佳琪台北報導】台股2026年第一個交易日成績亮眼，指數盤中刷新歷史新高紀錄至29363點，終場收在29349點，大漲386點，漲幅1.33%。累計單週強漲793點，週線連2紅，漲幅達2.78%，平均日均量5388.51億元。隨著CES展即將登場，且台積電法說會在即，投信對於元月行情抱持樂觀。\n\n台股2025年封關日的強勢行情延續至2026年紅盤日，大盤新年度開門喜，法人也同步買超。統計顯示，外資與自營商連袂買超台股，外資單週回補254.81億元，連續兩週站在買方；自營商買超169.02億元，已連續六週回補台股。僅投信法人連續兩週調節124.8億元。合計三大法人單週共買超台股299.04億元。\n\n保德信市值動能50 ETF(009803)經理人楊立楷展望台股2026年，認為有望續創新高。他說明，主要受惠AI需求有增無減，盤點於全球對台灣出口產品的需求持續強勁，尤其是涵蓋AI、半導體與電子零組件相關領域的電子產品、資訊通信年增率相對突出，也推升台灣企業產能，預估2026年台股企業獲利將延續雙位數高速成長。\n\n楊立楷表示，國際AI巨頭紛紛擴張資本支出並簽署合作協議，預期相關乘數效應將推動應用層面百花齊放，對於台廠AI供應鏈不啻為重大利多。而根據歷史數據，台股走勢與企業獲利呈現高度正向關聯，獲利增長往往伴隨指數上行，未來行情更值得期待。\n\n針對未來一週台股脈動，楊立楷表示，首先關注將於6日至9日在拉斯維加斯舉行的CES展，根據主辦單位預估，本次吸引約13萬名與會者、4500家廠商參展，且隨著AI持續發展，本屆CES以「AI Forward」為主題，反映出AI已不只停留在概念驗證階段，而是正式走向新的應用面與商業化階段。他說，本次CES展主題可預期人工智慧、智慧家居、綠色科技及車用技術將為焦點，並釋出AI落地與新應用的最新趨勢，而這些需求面將直接影響封裝、PCB、光通訊與記憶體等產業的拉貨節奏，進而激勵台廠供應鏈股價的表現空間。\n\n再者，光學龍頭大廠大立光於8日舉行法說會，晶圓龍頭大廠台積電法說會也將於15日舉辦。楊立楷提醒，兩大廠釋出的展望預料將牽動市場投資情緒。\n\n整體而言，楊立楷認為，從目前至1月上半月，美台股市通常呈現易漲難跌走勢，且時序進入1月，外資可望於假期結束全面回流，配合美股維持強勢及企業展望正向，台股有望再度放量推升，元月行情值得期待。",

      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Loaded Up on Nike Stock. Should You?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 12:38 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tim Cook bought 50,000 shares of Nike stock.\nThe Apple CEO is a director on Nike's board.\nNike recently returned to top-line growth, but there are still some major concerns.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nWhen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE) in late December, it got a lot of attention and even sent shares of the athletic apparel and shoe company sharply higher. After all, not only is Cook a successful businessman, but he is a Nike insider. The CEO sits on Nike's board of directors.\nInvestors sometimes treat insider buying as a simple signal: management (or board members) think the stock is undervalued. Sometimes that's right. But investors shouldn't follow blindly.\nSo, is Nike stock a good buy today or not? Let's take a look.\nCook's buy matters, but so does the context Notably, Cook's purchase was an open market one. This means it wasn't part of a stock option compensation plan (or a similar plan). Rather, he had to pay full price for his shares. Additionally, the purchase was sizable, totaling nearly $3 million. It also nearly doubled his stake in the company. Given the size of the purchase and the significant increase in Cook's stake, it's not surprising that the market interpreted the purchase as good news.\n\nStill, it's important to remember that Cook is a Nike director.\nThat doesn't mean the purchase is meaningless. But it does mean he may have incentives beyond pure return maximization. Directors often want to demonstrate alignment with shareholders, reinforce confidence during a rough stretch, or meet (or stay ahead of) internal ownership expectations. In other words, it can be both a sincere vote of confidence and a governance-minded move.\nA rough patch Investors should look beyond Cook's purchase to answer this simple question: Does Nike's business momentum (or lack of it) and valuation offer an attractive risk-reward right now?\nUnfortunately, I don't think so.\nNike's turnaround is making progress, but the business still looks challenged.\n\nRevenue in the company's second quarter of fiscal 2026 (a period ended on Nov. 30, 2025), rose just 1% year over year. Further, the composition of this revenue was probably even more discouraging than this anemic headline figure. Yes, wholesale revenue rose 8% year over year, but its higher-margin Nike Direct revenue fell 8%. Nike Direct is the company's direct-to-consumer channel, made up of Nike-owned stores and sales through its digital platforms. So, this channel speaks to the company's brand power with consumers, given how directly these channels are tied to its business and to consumers.\n\nStory Continues\nNike's profitability also moved in the wrong direction. Gross margin fell 300 basis points to 40.6%, and net income declined 32% to $792 million.\nSome of Nike's near-term problems are self-inflicted as it tries to reposition parts of its business and sharpen its product and brand message so that it can perform better over the long term. But Nike still has a lot of work to do.\n\n\"NIKE is in the middle innings of our comeback,\" said Nike CEO Elliott Hill in the company's latest earnings release, adding that the company is working through its \"Win Now\" strategic actions, including \"strengthening partner relationships\" and \"rebalancing our portfolio...\"\nMeanwhile, the athleisure space remains intensely competitive , as the company faces major competition from younger brands like Lululemon , Vuori, and Hoka, as well as more established brands like Adidas . Of course, Nike's brand still has enormous global equity. But consumers have more choices than ever.\nA look at valuation I'd be more willing to recommend Nike in the middle of its turnaround and an intensely competitive environment, but shares arguably don't look cheap enough. Sure, the company's dividend yield of 2.6% is solid, and Nike has an exceptional balance sheet. But with earnings moving in the wrong direction and sales barely growing, it's tough to justify the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 37.\n\nEven Nike's forward price-to-earnings is high, at 40. Measuring its price as a multiple of analysts' expected earnings per share over the next year, the fact that Nike's forward price-to-earnings ratio is higher than its trailing price-to-earnings ratio shows that analysts expect earnings to remain under pressure.\nGiven the competitive intensity in athleisure, declining sales in its direct-to-consumer channel, margin pressure, and ongoing uncertainty as far as tariffs go, I personally will be staying on the sidelines.\nCook's buy in Nike stock is interesting. But, for me, that's about all it is.\nShould you buy stock in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Should You Think About Buying Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Now?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 5:46 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. ( NASDAQ:SWKS ), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$80.66 and falling to the lows of US$60.50. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Skyworks Solutions' current trading price of US$64.40 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Skyworks Solutions’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhat Is Skyworks Solutions Worth? The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Skyworks Solutions today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $78.52, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Skyworks Solutions’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nWhat kind of growth will Skyworks Solutions generate? Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Skyworks Solutions' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? SWKS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nStory Continues\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SWKS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Skyworks Solutions , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\nIf you are no longer interested in Skyworks Solutions, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Marvell Technology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRVL) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nWith its stock down 9.0% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study Marvell Technology's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marvell Technology is:\n18% = US$2.5b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2025).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Marvell Technology\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nMarvell Technology's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE To start with, Marvell Technology's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Marvell Technology's net income shrunk at a rate of 6.6% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\nThat being said, we compared Marvell Technology's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 5.0% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MRVL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory Continues\nIs Marvell Technology Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? When we piece together Marvell Technology's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 8.4% (where it is retaining 92% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nIn addition, Marvell Technology has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 3.9% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.\nConclusion In total, it does look like Marvell Technology has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia has purchased Intel shares worth $5 billion, carrying out a transaction ‌announced in September.\nThe AI chipmaker had announced back then that it would pay $23.28 per share for Intel ⁠common stock, buying over 214.7 million Intel shares at the price set out in the agreement, as per Monday's filing. The deal forms part of a broader strategic agreement to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers.\nThe share purchase comes just a week after Reuters reported that Nvidia Corp. has halted a test to use Intel’s advanced 18A manufacturing process to make advanced chips. The AI chipmaker tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, the report said.\nInvestors had been closely watching Intel's advanced 18A as a milestone that could help the company compete more directly with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in advanced chip manufacturing. However, the halt now raises concerns about the company’s ability to regain ground in the foundry race.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures, and sells computer products and technologies, delivering data storage, computer, networking, and communications platforms.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) share price has soared 109% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock!\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring three years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 28% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Apple will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 112% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective Apple shareholders are up 12% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 16% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Apple you should know about.\n\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

Analyst sentiment has followed that move. Jefferies upgraded the shares to Buy and lifted its price target to $1,500. Oppenheimer kept an Outperform rating and set a $1,400 target. Those calls helped reinforce momentum and pushed investor confidence higher.\n\nThe broader backdrop has also helped. SEMI expects semiconductor equipment sales to hit a record in 2025, driven largely by AI-related investment. Those macro tailwinds fueled a rally across the sector, lifting many equipment names at the same time.\nEarlier in October, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates. Management pointed to strong AI-linked demand for its chipmaking tools, while also calling out growing risks tied to its China exposure amid ongoing US–China trade tensions.\nDemand for advanced chips that support generative AI workloads has continued to climb. That trend benefits niche suppliers like KLA, whose equipment is used inside semiconductor manufacturing facilities, commonly known as fabs.\n\nTrade policy remains a clear headwind. KLA expects US export restrictions to reduce sales by $300M to $350M over the next five quarters. The company said this reflects “additional market access loss related to certain customers in China resulting from extended export controls from the U.S. government,” according to a letter to shareholders.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is based in Milpitas, California. The company designs wafer fab equipment and supplies process control and yield management systems used across the semiconductor industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Moreover, AMD will be looking to build a platform, not just offer alternatives.\nCES 2025 recap: what Nvidia and AMD showed last year That said, here’s the lowdown from last year’s event for both tech giants.\nNvidia showed off its powerful Cosmos platform for “physical AI,” positioning it as a foundation for real-world deployment.\nNvidia introduced Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs while highlighting new RTX-PC AI tooling (including NIM microservices/Blueprints).\nAMD rolled out its AI PC portfolio, covering Ryzen AI Max/Max PRO , and expanded Ryzen AI 300 chips tailored to Copilot+ PCs.\nAMD leaned into gaming/graphics with Ryzen X3D desktop chips and Ryzen Z2 handheld processors. Also, it offered previews of the Radeon RX 9070- series (RDNA 4) GPUs and FSR 4.\n\nStory Continues\nAt CES 2026, the real fight is over AI CES 2026 runs January 6 to 9 in Las Vegas , and though it has historically been more of a gadget showcase, this year it’s shaping up to be the year’s first high-stakes tech meeting.\nInvestors expect a needle-moving event, spearheaded by concrete roadmaps, partnerships, and major commitments.\nFor the biggest chipmakers, CES will be all about owning the AI conversation early . Nvidia will seek to reinforce its dominance by rallying partners with demos, keynotes, and industry-wide signaling.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood shells out $1.3 million on biotech stock\nAMD will look to rain on Nvidia’s parade.\nBy spotlighting new PC platforms and capitalizing on a larger OEM market share , AMD will aim to carve out its own lane for AI-driven growth.\nFor perspective, the AI trade has lost its luster lately, and big-name skepticism targets are growing louder.\nFront and center is the “Big Short” Michael Burry , who is openly comparing the current AI frenzy to past manias.\nBurry delivered a scathing takedown of Nvidia.\nThat’s exactly why Nvidia and AMD will be looking for a strong start to set the tone early in 2026.\nBig banks reset targets on Nvidia and AMD Nvidia and AMD both had a solid outing at the stock market last year.\nFor perspective, Nvidia stock ended 2025 up 41% , while AMD posted an 83% gain .\nNow, Wall Street is recalibrating its expectations for 2026, with investors in “show-me” mode when it comes to AI.\nBank of America : Nvidia buy, $275 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nMorgan Stanley : Nvidia overweight, $250 price target; AMD equal weight, $260 price target\nUBS : Nvidia buy, $235 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nGoldman Sachs : Nvidia buy , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $210 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nJPMorgan : Nvidia overweight , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $270 price target\nSource: Barron's\nRelated: Veteran analyst resets AI stock buy list for 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 2, 2026, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

Cisco Systems, Inc. is placed seventh among the best long-term investments .\nTheFly reported on December 22 that shares of CSCO declined 26 cents to $78.16, reflecting mixed sentiment in the options market. Options volume was roughly in line with the average, with 51,000 contracts traded and calls outpacing puts, resulting in a put/call ratio of 0.77, above the typical level of 0.64.\n\nImplied volatility (IV30) fell 1.28 points to 18.8, placing it in the bottom quartile of the past year and indicating an expected daily move of $0.93. Meanwhile, the flattened put-call skew suggested a modestly bullish tone, pointing to cautious optimism among options traders despite the slight drop in shares.\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nSeparately, on December 17, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) received a boost when Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall maintained an Overweight rating and raised the price target from $82 to $91. In the research note, Marshall highlighted CSCO’s strong performance in AI-related growth drivers, noting that the company had surpassed $1 billion in AI-related orders, reaching $1.3 billion from hyperscale customers. This momentum suggests that AI-driven revenue could contribute around 5% of CSCO’s total business by fiscal year 2026, up from approximately 2% currently.\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) designs and sells a broad range of technologies across networking, security, collaboration, and applications. The company is currently leveraging its acquisition of Splunk to enhance its recurring software revenue and observability capabilities.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

They're hosting their own press event on January 5th. CEO Jensen Wong will take the stage. He did it last year as well. They announced a number of new products, a new chip for a smaller bitesize desktop AI computer, as well as a number of different software innovations that they've really been pushing as of late.

I mean, you know, the chips themselves are are, you know, obviously enough to say that AI is going to dominate, but uh you can expect to see a lot of robots, uh a lot of smart home devices. You can even see some wearables that are AI powered. And those usually, you know, so far we haven't seen anything too interesting as far as AI powered wearables outside of maybe, you know, the intelligence built into smart glasses or smart watches. There's never been a dedicated device that's really taken off. Open AI is supposedly working on one, don't expect it at CES. Uh and then finally, uh Autos.

Uh we know that there'll be some major automakers like Hyundai on hand, uh Sony and Honda, their uh Afeela vehicle will be there as well. Uh and so it's going to be a jam-packed show, but again, I think the big takeaway is going to be from Nvidia.

Shares of networking chips designer Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 4.9% in the afternoon session after positive reports highlighted strong momentum in its AI-focused custom chip business and optimistic growth projections for the year ahead.\nThe company’s AI XPU offerings experienced significant traction, which led to a 37.8% year-over-year increase in its data center segment revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. This growth was driven by its custom silicon products. Looking forward, analysts projected a “snap-back” year for Marvell, with expectations for revenue to surge by approximately 40% in fiscal 2026. This anticipated growth was fueled by both the recovery of its carrier and enterprise segments and the high-volume production of custom AI silicon, as previous inventory issues were largely resolved.\n\nIs now the time to buy Marvell Technology? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Marvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% on the news that investment firm Citi issued a positive catalyst watch for the stock ahead of the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES), contributing to a broader rally in the chip sector. Citi noted that worries about competition from two major clients were likely unfounded and viewed the stock's recent price drop as a buying opportunity. The firm anticipated Marvell would showcase wider use of its networking solutions at the conference. Adding to the positive sentiment, analysts at Benchmark clarified that Marvell had retained its role in Amazon's Trainium chip designs, easing recent investor concerns. The stock's move also came amid general strength in the semiconductor market, as other chipmakers like Micron and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index also posted gains.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,931.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

      "Content": "Is Broadcom Stock a Buy After the Dip?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:43 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Some investors are feeling skittish about the high levels of capital spending on AI.\nOne important player, Broadcom, has a big opportunity in custom chip production.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nSemiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the big winners in the recent generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom that started with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. Shares have soared by roughly 350% in three years as investors bet on its ability to capitalize on the soaring demand for advanced computing hardware.\n\nThat said, some market participants feel that the AI boom might be getting ahead of itself as companies overspend on data centers without a meaningful guarantee of future returns. This uncertainty has sent Broadcom's stock down by around 15% from its all-time high of $412.\nLet's dig deeper into the pros and cons of the stock to see if this dip is a buying opportunity or a signal for investors to stay far away.\nWhy are investors getting nervous? The stock's recent slide came after Broadcom's fourth-quarter earnings report in mid-December. On the surface, the numbers were fantastic.\nRevenue jumped 28% year over year to a record of $18 billion, driven by soaring demand for AI semiconductor revenue, which rose 74% in the period. This operating segment reflects sales of Broadcom's advanced computer hardware to AI data centers, and management expects the momentum to continue into 2026 as demand for these products continues to surge.\n\nBroadcom's bottom line is also looking great, with net income doubling to $8.5 billion. With numbers like these, it's hard to believe shares are on a two-week downtrend. However, the correction makes more sense when you look at some of the uncomfortable dynamics of the AI industry itself.\nAccording to analysts at Goldman Sachs , hyperscalers are on track to spend an eye-popping $527 billion on AI-related capital expenditures (capex) , with some of this going to hardware produced by companies like Broadcom. The problem is that the scale of the spending doesn't really match up with the profits generated by AI-related software services.\nDeutsche Bank expects ChatGPT creator OpenAI to lose $140 billion by 2029. And despite being one of the top hardware spenders (with roughly $125 billion in capex for 2025), Amazon saw its cloud computing revenue rise by a relatively modest $5.6 billion compared to the prior-year period. The fear is that eventually shareholders will start to push back on all the AI spending. After all, this is money that could be going to buybacks or dividends.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom might be better positioned than Nvidia It is fair to assume that AI-related capex spending could soon drop to reasonable levels, which could reduce the growth potential of infrastructure providers like Broadcom. That said, the company is better positioned to weather a potential fallout than the industry leader, Nvidia. To understand why, we must first look at the reasons why AI development is so expensive and generally unprofitable right now.\n\nRunning and training large language models like ChatGPT requires thousands of expensive AI accelerators (such as Nvidia's Blackwell series), which consume significant amounts of energy. Broadcom's semiconductor business actually helps solve this problem by helping its clients develop appl ication-specific integrated circui ts (ASICs). These are custom chips designed to do a specific workload, making them cheaper and easier to run than Nvidia's large, general-purpose chips.\nObviously, ASICs won't be the magic bullet that makes AI companies stop burning through money. But they are the natural first step as companies seek to reduce their reliance on expensive third-party hardware. In October, cloud giant Google selected Broadcom to build its first in-house AI processor chips. This development follows a deal with OpenAI to co-develop AI accelerators and Ethernet solutions.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy? Broadcom's ability to benefit from the transition to custom chips makes it a strong bet in the generative AI opportunity. That said, the AI boom is getting long in the tooth, and investors may want to wait until there is more clarity about the sustainability of current industry hardware spending before taking a position in such a highly exposed stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Dear AMD Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 5\n\nChris MacDonald\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:08 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nAmong the world's largest semiconductor makers, Nvidia (NVDA) remains the go-to choice for investors. And rightfully so—looking at this stock's long-term chart, investors who have stuck with this name have outperformed the market by an incredible margin in recent decades.\nOf course, it's not just a one-horse race, regardless of what the media tries to tell you. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is another top name worth considering, and one that's actually outperformed Nvidia on a year-to-date basis (YTD). Surging 77% to end 2025, AMD roughly doubled Nvidia's performance this year (the world's largest chipmaker still surged 39% higher in 2025, so not bad). Thus, there are plenty of eyeballs already on AMD as 2026 kicks off.\n\nMore News from Barchart NVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\nAfter Record Runs for Western Digital and Sandisk in 2025, Consider This 1 Data Center Storage Stock for 2026\nCrowdStrike Insiders Are Offloading CRWD Stock.

Sign Up Now!\nAs it turns out, there's another major catalyst on the horizon investors are watching when it comes to both companies. Analysts at Wedbush have pointed out that AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, is expected to make the keynote address at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on this date, with the potential for a big announcement to come.\n\nWhy Is This Catalyst So Important for AMD? I think the key announcements for AMD for this coming year are indeed likely to come at this event. CES is the biggest show in the world when it comes to anything tied to consumer electronics and is honestly one of the key shows I've always wanted to attend, for this reason. Many CEOs are expected to make big product announcements, from technological upgrades to next-generation technology expected to be released over the course of the year.\n\nI'd expect to see a strong narrative from Lisa Su around the company's roadmap moving forward, and Wedbush analysts tend to agree. They think that some “significant” technological improvements to AMD's core Ryzen chips could be announced at this conference. Doing so may propel a range of mega-cap tech companies who are looking for reasons to buy AMD chips (at a lower price point) to do so. Especially if the output differential between these Ryzen chips and Nvidia's new Blackwell and Rubin chips isn't as wide as it appears now.\n\nStory Continues\nWe'll have to see, of course, what is ultimately announced. But any sort of meaningful improvements in AMD's core CPU chip technology could spur greater investor interest in 2026 and take this stock's recent momentum to new levels. It does appear that AMD has retained strong pricing power, reflected in the company's margins above. If these margins expand further in the coming quarters, and AMD can show a cash flow growth profile that's above Wall Street estimates, I certainly think this is a stock that could be off to the races.\n\nSo, What Does Wall Street Think? As it turns out, Wedbush is just one of 44 analysts currently covering AMD stock. With a consensus price target of $285.05 per share on AMD stock, analysts believe that this chipmaker could have roughly 33% upside from current levels.\nThat's a healthy potential gain for investors looking to add some momentum to their portfolios in 2026. Indeed, momentum-driven growth stocks have provided most of the gains in the markets over the course of the past decade and a half. Thus, for those who think this trend is likely to continue and risk-on sentiment will remain in the coming year, AMD's fundamentals do point in a very positive direction right now.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Those who invested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) five years ago are up 89%\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nGenerally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 59% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 28%, including dividends.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.9% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 58.57.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Analog Devices will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective It's nice to see that Analog Devices shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Analog Devices has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory Continues\nOf course Analog Devices may not be the best stock to buy .

At the same time, the S&P 500 has returned 9.9%.\nIs now the time to buy QCOM? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nWhy Does QCOM Stock Spark Debate? Having been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\nTwo Positive Attributes: 1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Luckily, Qualcomm’s sales grew at an impressive 15.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n2. Stellar ROIC Showcases Lucrative Growth Opportunities Growth gives us insight into a company’s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? A company’s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nQualcomm’s five-year average ROIC was 47%, placing it among the best semiconductor companies. This illustrates its management team’s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\nOne Reason to be Careful: Projected Revenue Growth Is Slim Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Qualcomm’s revenue to rise by 3%, a deceleration versus its 15.3% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nFinal Judgment Qualcomm’s merits more than compensate for its flaws, but at $171.30 per share (or 14.2× forward P/E), is now the time to initiate a position?

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】大摩日前發布報告，點名亞洲AI前十強，其中台灣包含台積電、聯發科、京元電、信驊、世芯、創意等6檔上榜，統一投顧總經理、PCB女王廖婉婷認為，6檔當中世芯股價低、成長性夠，是2026開門就可以找買點的個股；如果眼光放遠，創意、聯發科續航力強勁；而台積電則是「神主牌」，本土法人遲早會回補。\n\n大摩選的台股六強都是優質個股，如果硬要挑該如何選擇？廖婉婷在「鈔錢部署」中表示，自己會先考慮獲利成長性，如果基期夠低，2026就比較有機會。\n\n她以世芯-KY(3661)為例，2025業績呈現衰退，但因為它是AWS Trainium 3供應鏈，屬於後段ASIC供應商，因此2026的業績貢獻度會很大，光是AWS貢獻世芯營收成長就接近1倍，獲利更會有1倍以上的成長，目前本益比才20出頭，空間還蠻大。\n\n世芯前3季歸屬母公司業主淨利為41.14億元，年減10.7％，每股純益為50.89元，較去年同期58.43元衰退13%，主因是北美主要CSP客戶5奈米AI晶片在2025年畫句點，法人預估世芯2025年EPS為67.8元。\n\n廖婉婷表示，世芯大客戶AWS的Trainium 3大概會在第2季出，通常法人布局都會提前1季，因此當跨入元月1日、2026第1季剛開始的時候就可以加碼。\n\n除世芯外，2026年會打進馬斯克的xAI的創意(3443)，也是廖婉婷長期看好個股。馬斯克先前發下豪語，2027年的AI晶片需求會比全市場目前用的GPU加ASIC來得更多。\n\n大客戶因台積電產能，喜歡和台灣ASIC廠合作廖婉婷分析，如果以Robotaxi，加上他的AI機器人大軍有可能成真，果真如此，對創意2027年的業績貢獻將會很大。\n\n另外聯發科(2454)也是從消費性產品打進ASIC市場，不過它Google的TPU下一代要等到2026年下半年、甚至第4季才可能出貨，所以業績貢獻會比較慢，但市場認為，即使到2027年再下一代，聯發科還是會是供應商。\n\n對於國外的客戶偏好找台灣的IP廠商合作ASIC，廖婉婷說，原因是台廠和台積電合作緊密，大家都想拿到台積電的產能，再加上台灣的封測產業很強，因此讓國際大廠頻頻登門合作。\n\n廖婉婷評估大摩挑選的6檔中，世芯因為股價低、成長性夠強，會有很大的成長空間，被認為是首選；但如果需要續航力、把眼光放大2027年，創意和聯發科都有很大成長機會。\n\n至於台積電是「神主牌」，廖婉婷說，一定會帶領台股再創新高，台股現在本益比23、24倍，台積電本益比才20倍，對台積電而言股價太委屈。\n\n她分析，主要是先前外資放假、內資減碼，加上年底壽險銀行必須獲利了結，以及會計制度改變，以及外價金的提列得減碼，所以很多金控銀行壽險年底會減低持股，明年第1季外資、本土法人會回補台積電，台積電的本益比至少應回到22倍到24倍之上。\n\n※免責聲明：文中所提之個股、ETF內容，並非任何投資建議與參考，請審慎判斷評估風險，自負盈虧。(新聞來源：旺得富理財網 王郁惠)",

      "Content": "MoneyDJ新聞 2026-01-02 10:26:10 黃立安 發佈\n\n半導體矽智財(IP)龍頭Arm針對2026年及未來發展趨勢發布20項技術預測，Arm認為2026年將邁入智慧運算新紀元，屆時運算將具備更高的模組化特性和能源效率表現，實現雲端、實體終端及邊緣AI環境的無縫互聯。法人看好ASIC暨矽智財族群包括創意(3443)、世芯-KY(3661)、智原(3035)、巨有(8227)等營運有望迎來一波高成長，而IC設計業者如瑞昱(2379)、聯詠(3034)、天鈺(4961)等也在邊緣AI佈局下，有望帶動新的成長動能。\n\nArm指出，隨著製程微縮成本持續攀升，產業正由單片式晶片轉向模組化小晶片設計，透過將運算、記憶體與I/O等功能拆分為可重複使用的模組，晶片設計業者可彈性搭配不同製程節點，不僅有助於降低研發成本，也能加快產品導入市場的速度。\n\n產業界亦觀察到，可高度客製的小晶片模組正快速崛起，這類模組可整合通用運算核心、特定領域加速器及專用AI引擎，讓晶片團隊無需從零開始，即可打造差異化SoC產品，大幅縮短設計週期並降低創新門檻。且隨著開放標準逐步成熟，不同廠商的小晶片可望實現可靠互通，進一步擴大供應鏈選擇，形塑以互通性元件為核心的新生態系。\n\n在AI運算架構上，Arm認為，特定領域加速技術已成為效能提升關鍵，但未來競爭焦點不再只是通用CPU與加速器的簡單分工，而是朝向系統級協同設計演進。晶片將從系統層面與軟體堆疊同步最佳化，針對特定AI框架、資料型態與工作負載進行深度調校，以達成效能與能效的最優解。\n\n雲端服務商已率先實踐此一方向，包括AWS的Graviton、Google Cloud的Axion及Microsoft Azure的Cobalt，皆採用從底層即整合CPU、加速器、記憶體與互連的設計思維，打造高度客製化的平台架構。Arm認為，這將加速次世代AI資料中心落地，在有限空間內極大化AI算力，同時有效降低能耗與整體運行成本。\n\n法人指出，Arm所描繪的技術路線，對ASIC暨矽智財族群帶來中長期結構性利多。隨著客製化晶片與小晶片設計需求快速升溫，具備先進製程與系統級設計能力的ASIC業者，將在雲端服務商與大型AI客戶專案中扮演關鍵角色，包括創意、世芯-KY、智原及巨有等業者，均有望受惠於高階加速器與客製SoC專案增加，帶動營收與獲利的成長動能。\n\n在IC設計端，邊緣AI加速普及亦被視為下一波成長契機。Arm預期，AI推論任務將持續由雲端下沉至終端裝置，2026年邊緣AI將從基礎資料分析，進一步升級至即時推論與動態適配能力，並可承載更複雜模型運行。法人看好，瑞昱、聯詠、天鈺等IC設計業者，隨著AI功能導入電視、顯示器、PC、消費性與工控設備，產品單價與附加價值提升，有助於開啟新的成長曲線。",

      "Content": "The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10%\n\nSam Quirke, MarketBeat\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 11:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nKey Points Qualcomm’s MACD just flipped bearish again, and the stock is already slipping after a strong run from April.\nA similar signal in early November was followed by a fast, double-digit drop, making this setup hard to ignore.\nThe near-term “tell” is whether buyers defend the low-$170s, or whether the stock breaks down ahead of February earnings.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAfter showing many promising signs over the past quarter, shares of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) are flashing a sudden warning signal as the new year begins. Just before Christmas, the stock’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) chart logged a bearish crossover, confirming a momentum shift that has continued into this week. The mega-cap tech stock closed just below $174 on Dec. 30, still up roughly 40% since April, but also down about 15% from the late-October surge that briefly reignited bullish enthusiasm.\nSince then, however, Qualcomm has been narrowing into a tight range, and while its long-term fundamentals remain supportive, its short-term technicals are flashing caution. What makes it all the more noteworthy is that the last time this exact setup appeared, the outcome was not kind to the bulls. Could history be about to repeat itself? Let’s jump in and take a closer look.\n\n→ Hi Ho Silver Away! Silver Breaks $80 as Poor Man's Gold Explodes\nWhat Qualcomm’s Bearish MACD Crossover Signals Now The MACD is a momentum indicator that tracks the relationship between two moving averages. When the shorter-term average crosses below the longer-term one, it’s regarded as a reliable signal that upside momentum is fading and that sellers are beginning to gain the upper hand. Importantly, this is not just an intraday wobble. The crossover that appeared just before Christmas has now continued and picked up pace into this week.\n\nThat matters because MACD signals tend to be more reliable when they appear after extended rallies. Qualcomm’s run since April has been one of its most sustained in years, and so this sudden divergence could be an early warning that buyers are starting to step back, rather than to continue building positions.\n→ D-Wave vs. IonQ vs. IBM vs. Google: Which Quantum Bets Will Win 2026?\nNow, it doesn’t mean a breakdown from here is inevitable. But it does suggest that the stock is vulnerable if bulls fail to step in soon, especially given how the stock behaved the last time this happened.\nThe Last Time QCOM Flashed This Signal, Shares Dropped 10% The most recent comparison point came less than two months ago in early November. At the time, Qualcomm had also printed a bearish MACD crossover after a strong move to multi-year highs. In a move that surprised us all, what followed was a swift decline of more than 10% over the following two weeks.\n\nStory Continues\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02\nThe setup then shares several similarities with today. The stock had been moving higher into the middle of December since bottoming out from November’s correction, but in the face of increased selling pressure over the past fortnight, the bulls have been nowhere to be seen.\n\nHistory might not repeat perfectly when it comes to stocks, but it often rhymes. The point isn’t so much that Qualcomm is definitely going to fall another 10% from here; it’s that, at the very least, the stock is flashing a warning signal that is worth noting.\nWhy This Qualcomm Setup Could Play Out Differently There are also reasons not to be overly negative. Unlike early November, Qualcomm hasn’t just retreated from a multi-year high, and is actually starting to trade within a tightening range. With the longer-term uptrend still intact, it could be said to have been coiling into a pre-breakout setup over the past week, more so than starting to break down.\n\nIts fundamentals also look as strong as they have all year, with expectations building for Qualcomm to once again top the consensus in their first earnings report of 2026, due in early February. As we’ve highlighted in recent weeks, too, investor perception has been improving as the company’s diversification efforts continue to build momentum.\nEspecially when the broader equity market is in risk-on mode, this underlying narrative supports higher prices over time, even if the near-term path is choppy. That longer-term view is supported by TradeSmith’s Health Indicator, a volatility-based metric that has consistently ranked Qualcomm in the green zone for six consecutive months.\n\nWhat Bulls Must Do for Qualcomm to Start 2026 Strong Still, for Qualcomm to start 2026 on the right foot, the bulls need to reassert control soon. If the stock continues to drift lower below $172, it would significantly increase the odds of another leg down similar to November’s move.\nConversely, if buyers step in and momentum begins to turn back up, this crossover could prove to be a false alarm within a broader uptrend. Having worked hard to shake off its reputation for exasperating investors with multiple false promises, Qualcomm has earned some benefit of the doubt after its strong performance since April, but that goodwill is not unlimited.\nThe next week or two will tell a lot. A stock can coil only for so long before it has to choose a direction, one way or the other. With its fundamentals pointing higher and technicals pulling in the opposite direction, Qualcomm is approaching a moment of decision.\nThe article \" The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10% \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 15, Goldman Sachs downgraded Arm Holdings to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $120, which was brought down from $160. This decision was made as the firm updated its 2026 semiconductor sector outlook and predicted that rising AI spending by hyperscalers will support digital, memory, and storage markets, while a recovery in the automotive and industrial sectors should benefit analog chips. However, Goldman Sachs downgraded Arm Holdings due to its limited exposure to the AI cycle, its ongoing business model transition, and the challenges it faces in gaining traction across non-traditional markets.\n\nIn FQ2 2026, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) achieved its best FQ2 performance to date, with total revenue reaching $1.14 billion, which was a 34% increase year-on-year. This growth was fueled by record royalty revenue of $620 million (up 21%) and a massive 56% surge in licensing revenue, which totaled $515 million. The licensing spike reflects intense global demand for next-gen AI products and Arm Holdings’ high-efficiency compute architecture. The company also delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of its previous guidance.\nStrategically, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is positioning itself as the primary solution to the power bottlenecks currently hindering data center expansion. The company’s platform is approximately 50% more energy-efficient than its competitors, a factor that has led to widespread adoption by industry giants including Nvidia, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. This efficiency drove ARM’s Neoverse royalties to more than double year-on-year. Furthermore, the company announced a strategic partnership with Meta to optimize AI efficiency and revealed plans to acquire DreamBig Semiconductor to secure critical intellectual property for data center networking and high-speed communications.\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) architects, develops, and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies for semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】世界先進（5347）營運展望維持穩健。法人指出，第四季受惠長約（LTA）收入認列與匯率有利條件，營收與毛利率表現可望與上季持平或略優；展望2026年，雖受新廠驗證與設備取得限制，且新加坡12吋新產能尚未開出，內部視為「過渡年」，但電源管理平台持續擴張、AI伺服器需求放量，加上非中車用與工業市場回溫帶動，全年營收仍有機會維持雙位數成長。\n\n法人分析，世界先進第四季營運表現符合預期，10、11月合併營收合計76.64億元、年增5.7％，主要來自季底額外LTA收入認列，加上近期新台幣兌美元偏弱，有助出口型晶圓代工廠營收與毛利率。\n\n再者，隨電源管理產品比重拉升，產品組合改善亦成為支撐毛利率的重要因素。\n\n時序進入2026年首季，市場原先擔憂傳統淡季效應，但法人認為「淡季不悲觀」。一方面，消費性電子需求自2025年下半年起趨於保守，庫存調整壓力可控；另一方面，記憶體報價飆升，部分顯示驅動IC與相關客戶提前回補庫存，加上車用與工業客戶需求穩定，使得整體產能利用率變化有限。\n\n法人預期，世界先進第一季營收可望持穩，且在產品組合轉佳與匯率條件支撐下，毛利率反而可望微幅提升。\n\n世界先進目前擁有五座8吋晶圓廠，主力製程涵蓋高壓、超高壓、BCD及分離式元件等特殊製程，其中電源管理平台占營收比約75％，為最核心成長動能。\n\n法人指出，AI伺服器對電源管理IC與功率元件用量，較一般伺服器呈倍數成長，日本與美系客戶導入意願高，可望推升世界先進AI相關營收占比至15％，成為未來數年重要結構性成長來源。\n\n也因新廠與產線進度，2026年被定位為過渡年。法人表示，世界先進旗下VSMC已開始移入設備，2026年將進行產線與產品驗證，預計2027年量產，因此2026年尚無實質貢獻。\n\n同時，8吋設備取得難度高，也使台灣既有廠區新增產能相對有限。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一張瑞益／台北報導)",

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 0.14%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.79%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Analog Devices in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.28, showcasing a 39.88% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.11 billion, up 28.21% from the prior-year quarter.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $9.79 per share and a revenue of $12.82 billion, signifying shifts of +25.67% and +16.36%, respectively, from the last year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Analog Devices. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.52% higher. Analog Devices is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\nIn terms of valuation, Analog Devices is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.07. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 44.32 of its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, ADI's PEG ratio is currently 1.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.47.\nThe Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 31, which puts it in the top 13% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

      "Content": "Why Qualcomm (QCOM) Dipped More Than Broader Market Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) closed at $171.05 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.5% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.74%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.63%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.76%.\nComing into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 1.73% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 0.14%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.79%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Qualcomm in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $3.38, showcasing a 0.88% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year.

These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.02% downward. Qualcomm is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nIn the context of valuation, Qualcomm is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 14.29. This denotes a discount relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 35.99.\n\nInvestors should also note that QCOM has a PEG ratio of 3.11 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Electronics - Semiconductors industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.04.\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 96, putting it in the top 39% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

      "Content": "Tower Semiconductor Draws New $109 Million Institutional Stake Amid a 127% Stock Run\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 10:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nAPLD\n\nMTZ\n\nKey Points Florida-based Hood River Capital Management initiated a new stake in Tower Semiconductor, buying up 1.51 million shares in the third quarter.\nThe shares were worth about $109.22 million as of September 30.\nThe position places Tower Semiconductor outside the fund's top five holdings.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nFlorida-based Hood River Capital Management reported a new position in Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) valued at approximately $109.22 million, according to a November 14 SEC filing.\nWhat Happened Hood River Capital Management established a new position in Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) , acquiring 1.51 million shares valued at $109.22 million as of September 30, according to its SEC filing dated November 14. The new stake amounts to 1.29% of the fund’s $8.47 billion in reportable U.S. equity assets, raising its total number of holdings to 152 at quarter-end.\n\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:APLD: $482.81 million (5.7% of AUM)\nNYSE:MTZ: $350.38 million (4.13% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:KTOS: $246.07 million (2.91% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:DAVE: $215.46 million (2.54% of AUM)\nNYSE:FIX: $199.03 million (2.35% of AUM)\nAs of Wednesday, shares of Tower Semiconductor were priced at $118.08, up a staggering 127% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500's 17% gain in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.51 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$195.48 million\nPrice (as of Wednesday)\n$118.08\n\nCompany Snapshot Tower Semiconductor offers analog-intensive mixed-signal semiconductor devices, including SiGe, BiCMOS, RF CMOS, CMOS image sensors, integrated power management, and MEMS, as well as wafer fabrication and design enablement services.\nIt operates as an independent foundry, generating revenue through manufacturing and customizing semiconductor wafers for integrated device manufacturers and fabless companies on a contract basis.\nThe company serves a diversified customer base across consumer electronics, communications, automotive, industrial, aerospace, military, and medical device sectors worldwide.\n\nTower Semiconductor is a leading pure-play foundry specializing in analog and mixed-signal semiconductor manufacturing, with a global footprint and a workforce of over 5,600 employees. The company leverages advanced process technologies and a flexible manufacturing model to address specialized customer requirements in high-growth, high-reliability end markets. Its competitive edge is built on technology customization, deep industry expertise, and broad market reach across multiple geographies and applications.\n\nStory Continues\nFoolish Take This move shows conviction during a staggering stock run. Tower Semiconductor exited the third quarter with momentum across revenue, margins, and capital deployment. Revenue reached $396 million in the third quarter, up 6% sequentially, while net income climbed to $54 million, or $0.48 per share, reflecting operating leverage across its core platforms. Meanwhile, management’s guidance for a record $440 million of revenue in the fourth quarter underscores why some investors are still leaning in despite the stock’s sharp run-up.\n\nWhat also stands out is where Tower is spending. The company committed an additional $300 million to expand SiPho and SiGe capacity, targeting optical transceivers and data center demand, segments with structurally higher margins and long-duration growth drivers.\n\nAnd as for the broader context, this fund’s largest holdings skew toward higher-volatility growth names, suggesting Tower is being used as a quality compounder rather than a speculative swing.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable assets: Assets disclosed by institutional investment managers in quarterly SEC filings, covering U.S. equity holdings.\nAssets under management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or investment firm.\nTop holdings: The largest individual investments in a fund's portfolio, typically ranked by market value or portfolio weight.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nPure-play foundry: A semiconductor company that manufactures chips for other companies but does not design its own products.\nAnalog-intensive mixed-signal: Semiconductor devices combining analog and digital circuits, often used for processing real-world signals.\nSiGe: Silicon-germanium, a semiconductor material used to enhance performance in certain electronic devices.\nBiCMOS: A technology combining bipolar and CMOS transistors on a single chip for improved speed and power efficiency.\nRF CMOS: Radio frequency complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor; technology for integrating radio frequency circuits on standard CMOS chips.\nCMOS image sensors: Devices that convert light into electronic signals, widely used in cameras and imaging equipment.\nMEMS: Microelectromechanical systems; tiny mechanical devices built onto semiconductor chips for sensing or actuation.\nFabless companies: Firms that design semiconductor chips but outsource manufacturing to foundries rather than owning fabrication facilities.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is trading at an all-time high with the share price of $1,279.60 on December 26. This comes after impressive 100.59% year-to-date gains.\nWall Street is bullish ahead of the company’s fiscal Q2 2026 earnings, expected to be released on January 28. Analysts expect the company to post around $3.25 billion in revenue along with a GAAP EPS of $8.49. Recently, on December 19, Deutsche Bank reiterated a Hold rating on the stock without disclosing any price targets. Earlier, on December 16, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $1,400 to $1,450.\nArya of BofA noted that the US semiconductor stocks are attractively positioned for 2026. He sees 2026 as the halfway point of an 8-10 year-long cycle. Arya sees 2026 to be the year of faster IT upgradation, AI utilization, and AI workloads. He cautioned the investors regarding slight choppiness due to increased investor scrutiny on AI return on investment; however, this is expected to be offset by fast AI LLM builders and AI factories.\n\nThat said, on December 15, Blayne Curtis from Jefferies upgraded KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) from Market Perform to Outperform with a $1,500 price target. The analyst believes that the company enjoys a significant edge on a stronger leading edge/packaging outlook. The firm also has a constructive outlook on the wafer fab equipment growth in 2026 and 2027.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced process control equipment and services for the semiconductor and electronics industries, helping chipmakers find tiny defects, improve yields, and enhance quality in making logic chips, memory (like DRAM/NAND), LEDs, and more, essentially providing the high-tech tools to ensure flawless microchip production.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

That matters because about half of GlobalFoundries' revenue comes from those areas.\nThere are still positives.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop Upgrades:\n\nKeefe Bruyette upgraded TeraWulf (WULF) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $24, up from $9.50. The firm believes investors are underestimating the magnitude of TeraWulf's bitcoin mining to high performance compute leasing mix shift in 2026 and 2027.\nClear Street upgraded Plug Power (PLUG) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $3, down from $3.50. The firm sees more attractive upside in the shares following the recent selloff. It cites dilution from Plug Power's convertible refinancing in late November for the target drop.\n\nTop Downgrades:\n\nWedbush downgraded GlobalFoundries (GFS) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $40, down from $42. While the firm believes that GlobalFoundries has a path to a model with stronger revenues, improved utilization, and better margins on improved end market fundamentals and a shift towards local supply chains, it also believes recent developments have elongated the timeframe around when those catalysts might play out, the firm tells investors.\nWedbush downgraded Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) to Neutral from Outperform with a $125 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade, noting that the stock is approaching the firm's target price and the 25-times multiple it uses to value Tower Semiconductor ostensibly already assumes some upside vs. its current estimates.\nTruist downgraded DigitalBridge (DBRG) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $16 following the announced all-cash acquisition by SoftBank Group (SFTBY) at $16 per share. The firm sees a low probability of a competing bid emerging.\nRaymond James double downgraded OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) to Market Perform from Strong Buy without a price target following the company's announcement to acquire Flushing Financial (FFIC) . The firm expects \"significant\" dilution and says the deal slows the benefit of OceanFirst's shift to a stronger core deposit franchise.\nRaymond James downgraded Flushing Financial (FFIC) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company agreed to be acquired by OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) . The deal was done at a fair price given the earnings challenges Flushing has faced due to the challenging rate environment for the past several years, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop Initiations:\n\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Serve Robotics (SERV) with a Buy rating and $16 price target. The firm believes Serve is positioned for \"strong growth and eventual profitability.\"\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of International Bancshares (IBOC) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. While the bank has elevated commercial real estate concentration, interest-rate sensitivity, and exposure to cross-border activity, the firm sees these factors being balanced by strong profitability supported by \"best-in-class\" efficiency and conservative balance sheet positioning.\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Butterfly Network (BFLY) with a Buy rating and $5 price target. The firm sees continued revenue expansion for Butterfly, driven by iQ3 probe and enterprise software adoption.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Analog Devices (ADI): Read This Before Placing a Bet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADI Check price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Analog Devices, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ADI Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $9.79.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Analog Devices may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Silicon Motion falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Silicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share, indicating a change of +44% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 points to a change of +3.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.88 indicates a change of +37.5% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nStory continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $260.55 million indicates a year-over-year change of +36.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $863.29 million and $1.05 billion estimates indicate +7.4% and +21.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $242 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.07 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.52%. The EPS surprise was +23.46%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "KLA (KLAC) Suffers a Larger Drop Than the General Market: Key Insights\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nKLA (KLAC) ended the recent trading session at $1,243.65, demonstrating a -1.33% change from the preceding day's closing price.

In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $3.24 billion, indicating a 5.39% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nKLAC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $35.44 per share and revenue of $13.04 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.49% and +7.31%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for KLA. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.1% upward. KLA is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\nIn the context of valuation, KLA is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 35.57. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.48, so one might conclude that KLA is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that KLAC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.36. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

      "Content": "PLTR vs. ARM: Which AI-Tech Stock is the Better Buy Now?\n\nShuvra Shankar Dey\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nARM\n\nPalantir Technologies PLTR and Arm Holdings ARM are both deeply aligned with the same powerful theme: the accelerating global adoption of artificial intelligence. Each plays a foundational role in enabling AI at scale.\nPalantir supports AI deployment through sophisticated data integration, analytics and decision-making platforms that help organizations operationalize complex data. ARM underpins AI progress at the hardware level by licensing energy-efficient processor architectures that power AI workloads across mobile devices, cloud infrastructure and data centers. While their offerings differ, both companies occupy critical points in the AI value chain, directly benefiting from the rising demand for intelligent, scalable computing solutions from enterprises, governments and consumers.\n\nThe Case for PLTR Palantir has strategically positioned itself to capitalize on the changing dynamics of the AI economy.\nAt the core of Palantir’s strategy is its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which enables businesses to structure and organize their data, whether financial, supply chain, operational or HR-related, so that AI can process and execute tasks more effectively. By leveraging an ontology-driven approach, Palantir creates digital representations of entire enterprises, allowing AI to interact seamlessly with business operations. Unlike companies that contribute to the oversupply of AI models, Palantir is actively shaping the demand side of the AI economy, positioning itself as a key player in the adoption of enterprise AI.\n\nPalantir’s financial health further reinforces its investment appeal. As of Sept. 30, 2025, the company held $6.4 billion in cash and equivalents, with zero debt, providing ample liquidity to invest in growth initiatives.\nMoreover, Palantir’s recent financial performance underscores its strength. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues surged 63% year over year, with U.S. revenues increasing 77% year over year and U.S. commercial business experiencing 121% growth. The company closed 204 deals of at least $1 million, 91 deals of at least $5 million and 53 deals of at least $10 million in the quarter.\nThe company achieved its highest-ever adjusted operating margin of 51%, reflecting the scalability of its software business model and disciplined cost control. GAAP operating income reached $393 million, while GAAP net income came in at $476 million, translating to GAAP EPS of 18 cents and adjusted EPS of 21 cents, which increased 110% year over year.\n\nThe Case for ARM Arm Holdings’ foundational advantage in power-efficient chip architecture continues to anchor its dominance in mobile computing, but its influence extends far beyond smartphones and tablets. Long known for enabling energy-saving designs for Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Samsung, Arm is becoming increasingly central as these companies accelerate their focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nStory Continues\nARM’s unique ability to deliver high performance with minimal power makes its architecture ideal for an era where intelligence is embedded everywhere, from wearables to edge devices and cloud infrastructure. AI models are being deployed across a wide array of consumer and enterprise products, and Arm’s flexible, power-thrifty designs are being adopted to support these new workloads. Apple continues to rely on ARM-based architecture for its M-series chips as it deepens AI integration across its devices. Qualcomm is using ARM designs to drive AI-enhanced smartphones and automotive platforms, while Samsung leverages ARM’s technology across mobile, consumer electronics and its expanding Exynos portfolio targeting AI and IoT applications.\n\nThe reliance of these major tech players on Arm Holdings is not only consistent but also strengthening. As Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung scale their AI ambitions and broaden their IoT ecosystems, they depend even more on ARM’s ability to deliver power-efficient performance at global scale. The company’s ongoing push to optimize its architecture for machine learning and edge computing ensures tight alignment with the emerging needs of its top customers.\nAs a result, Arm Holdings is evolving from a mobile-centric enabler to a critical AI and IoT infrastructure layer for the world’s leading device makers, solidifying its strategic importance across the broader technology landscape.\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for PLTR & ARM? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR’s 2025 sales and EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 54% and 78%, respectively. EPS estimates have been trending upward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARM’s fiscal 2026 sales and EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 21.5% and 5.5%, respectively. EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nARM’s Valuation More Attractive Than PLTR While ARM appears attractively valued with a forward 12-month P/E of 52.93X versus its median of 121.35X, suggesting that the stock could be undervalued relative to its historical range, PLTR is trading at a forward 12-month P/E of 177.24X, below its 12-month median of 308.7X.\nPLTR Seems a Choice In the current AI-driven market environment, Palantir stands out as the more compelling choice. While both companies benefit from long-term AI adoption, Palantir is more directly tied to real-world AI execution and enterprise decision-making. Its platforms are already embedded in mission-critical operations across commercial and government sectors, creating durable demand and high switching costs. Palantir’s focus on operational AI positions it on the front lines of adoption rather than infrastructure dependency. With stronger momentum, clearer AI monetization and a Buy rating compared with Arm’s Hold stance, Palantir offers greater upside for investors seeking exposure to AI as a transformative business force rather than a supporting technology layer.\n\nWhile PLTR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), ARM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in KLA Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\nFor most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in KLA (KLAC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to KLAC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nKLA's Business In-Depth With that in mind, let's take a look at KLA's main business drivers.\nSan Jose, CA-based KLA Corporation is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of process diagnostics and control (PDC) equipment and yield management solutions required for the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) or chips. The company has a comprehensive portfolio of products addressing each major PDC subsegment&mdash;photomask (reticle) inspection, wafer inspection/defect review and metrology.\n\nReticle production is vital to the semiconductor device formation process. Reticles are used to control the precise deposition of materials onto the wafer, which ultimately change its chemical characteristics, imparting specific functionalities to the ICs thus created. Inspection and metrology tools measure the quality of the reticles, helping to improve reticle production yields. As a result of the broader applicability of semiconductors, shrinking form factors and increasing functionalities of individual chips, reticle design and production are growing in importance. Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor were the largest customers in the last three years, accounting for more than 10% of total sales in each year.\n\nKLA reported revenues of $12.16 billion in fiscal 2025. Product revenues accounted for 78% while the rest came from Service segment.\n\nKLA&rsquo;s two main product lines are defect inspection and metrology. The company&rsquo;s defect inspection tools have very broad application in chip, wafer, reticle, storage, compound semiconductor and MEMS manufacturing. Metrology tools are used to gather critical dimension measurements of the wafer and process dimensions such as film thickness, lithography overlay and surface profiling. The company&rsquo;s metrology products are used in chip, wafer, reticle and solar device manufacturing. KLA also offers other products and services.\n\nIn addition to new tools, KLA also offers a comprehensive portfolio of refurbished tools that upgrade and improve yields of existing equipment under the KT-Certified program. Refurbished tools are currently sold to IC, reticle, substrate, MEMS and data storage manufacturers.\n\nAlthough KLA is a major player in each of its served markets, it faces competition from other large equipment suppliers such as Applied Materials and Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation.\n\nStory Continues\nBottom Line While anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in KLA ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in December 2015 would be worth $18,031.33, or a 1,703.13% gain, as of December 30, 2025, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 232.27% and the price of gold increased 293.02% over the same time frame in comparison.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for KLAC.\nKLA's fiscal first-quarter revenues and earnings increased year over year. The uptick can be attributed to strong demand in leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging, which drove growth in the semiconductor industry. Advanced packaging is expected to exceed $925 million in 2025. The company's robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. The services business also performed well, contributing significantly to revenue growth. KLA is well-positioned to capitalize on AI advancements, with AI driving demand for higher-value wafer processing and more complex designs. However, extended U.S. export controls on China impacted revenues in the reported quarter. Tariff-related uncertainties also impacted the company's performance.\nThe stock is up 8.92% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2025. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The Mac segment is expected to face a tough year-over-year comparison, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate.\n\nHowever, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> )\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past six months (+14% vs. +13.6%). The company&rsquo;s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk's acquisition enhances the company&rsquo;s recurring revenue base.\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco&rsquo;s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco&rsquo;s security portfolio.\n\nNetworking sales benefited from strong demand for AI infrastructure and campus networking solutions. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers were strong driven by high double-digit order growth in hyperscalers. However, stiffening competition is a headwind.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>> )\n\nIBM&rsquo;s shares have gained +4.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry&rsquo;s gain of +47.8%. The company is betting big on the Watsonx platform, which is likely to be its core technology platform for AI capabilities. The company&rsquo;s focus on quantum technology for solutions to complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing is a tailwind.\n\nIBM is benefiting from a surge in demand for heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has led to sustainable growth through advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nHowever, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Macroeconomic headwinds are worrisome. IBM&rsquo;s acquisition spree has also escalated integration risks, while its high debt level is burdensome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> )\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights International Business Machines, Analog Devices, Johnson & Johnson's, The Gap and Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:14 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nJNJ\n\nHPE\n\nADI\n\nGAP\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI, Johnson & Johnson&rsquo;s JNJ, The Gap, Inc. GAP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop 5 High-Yield S&P 500 Stock to Buy for 2026\nThe U.S. stock market has experienced significant volatility at the beginning of 2025 owing to a multitude of factors. The trade policy framework undertaken in the new Trump administration has reshaped market sentiment. The aggressive tariff measures imposed by Washington on its major trading partners have left several businesses in a state of uncertainty. The growing Sino-U.S. trade tension was a concerning factor for investors. The U.S. government aims to limit Beijing&rsquo;s access to high-end technologies. It has imposed restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor tech to China.\nThe tariff-related uncertainties have significantly affected companies with a strong presence in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Moreover, the war in Europe and the Middle East has further aggravated the market uncertainty. These developments have led to rising manufacturing costs and supply chain issues, putting pressure on margins. However, there were some positive macroeconomic developments as well in 2025. The federal reserve rate cuts have lowered borrowing costs and improved corporate profitability.\n\nTrade-related risks and changes in monetary policy led to frequent stock price fluctuations. However, broader market momentum remained positive with tech stocks largely leading the bull run. Growing spending on AI infrastructure and digital transformation is driving growth in the tech sector. Despite a hike in energy prices, the overall annual inflation rate was lower than expected in 2025.\nKey Growth Drivers for 2026\nRapid AI buildouts are expected to be a key driver for businesses in 2026. Businesses in several industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, social ecommerce, telecom and others are rapidly incorporating AI across the portfolio to gain a competitive edge. However, this rapid AI build-out requires substantial computing infrastructure, data centers to support these AI workloads, as well as energy optimization and cooling technologies.\n\nStory Continues\nAI integration has become capex-heavy. There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.\n\nChina is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government&rsquo;s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.\nAmid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.\n\nKey Picks\nInternational Business Machines Corp. : Headquartered in Armonk, NY, IBM is a leading provider of cloud and data platforms.

      "Content": "CRDO vs. MRVL: Which Data Center Connectivity Stock Is Smarter Pick?\n\nVaishali Doshi\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRDO\n\nMRVL\n\nCredo Technology Group Holding Ltd . ( CRDO ) and Marvell Technology, Inc . ( MRVL ) are semiconductor companies that specialize in high-speed connectivity solutions that are essential for AI-driven data centers.\nAmid rapid artificial intelligence (AI) proliferation, investors are focusing on companies that offer the infrastructure behind it. Semiconductor companies are at the core of AI workloads as these offer solutions to enable augmented processing power and efficiency. CRDO and Marvell are key players in this domain and bring to the table unique strengths. This makes it an intriguing comparison for investors.\n\nNow the question arises: which stock makes a better investment pick at present? Let us dive into the fundamentals, valuations, growth outlook and risks for each company.\nThe Case for CRDO Credo’s leadership in the AEC space is one of its biggest catalysts. AEC business remains its fastest-growing segment. CRDO noted that AECs, now scaling to 100-gig per lane and transitioning to 200-gig per lane architectures, have become the “de facto” standard for inter-rack connectivity. These are now replacing optical rack-to-rack connections of up to 7 meters. The increasing adoption of zero-flap AECs is mainly due to these cables offering up to 1,000 times more reliability with 50% lower power consumption than optical solutions, added CRDO.\n\nBeyond AECs, Credo’s IC portfolio, which includes retimers and optical DSPs, continued to show a healthy performance. Credo’s PCIe retimer program remains on track for design wins in fiscal 2026 and revenue contributions in the next fiscal year.\nOne of the most important recent developments for Credo is its introduction of three growth pillars, each representing a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. These include Zero-Flap (“ZF”) optics, active LED cables (ALCs) and OmniConnect gearboxes (Weaver).\nZF optics is a laser-based connectivity solution delivering AEC-level reliability through a custom optical DSP tightly integrated with Credo’s software stack. The optics are already in live data-center trials, with sampling to a second U.S. hyperscaler expected later in fiscal 2026. ALCs utilize micro-LEDs, delivering AEC-level reliability and power efficiency, and support up to 30-meter connections for row-scale data center networks. Sampling is planned for fiscal 2027, with revenues in fiscal 2028. Credo expects the ALC market to grow to more than twice the size of the AEC market. OmniConnect gearboxes are designed to optimize XDU connectivity.\nCredo now has five main high-growth pillars — AECs, IC solutions (retimers and optical DSPs), Zero-Flap optics, ALCs and OmniConnect gearboxes. Collectively, these present a total market opportunity likely to surpass $10 billion, more than tripling Credo’s market reach just 18 months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Case for MRVL Marvell is a semiconductor company with a diversified product portfolio that includes custom ASICs, data center switches and 5G chips. The company’s strategic pivot to prioritize the data center market is proving to be a successful growth catalyst. The data center end market emerged as the company's largest segment, with revenue contribution of 73% in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. The company's custom XPU silicon, electro-optic interconnect products and next-generation switch offerings are the primary drivers of its strong data center performance.\n\nInterconnect business remains impressive. The increasing demand for AECs and retimers, driven by the shift to high-speed PAM-based solutions, is likely to drive revenues from this segment moving forward. It has been working with the cable ecosystem to enable 100 and 200 gig per lane AECs and is likely to begin significant product ramps. It also noted that PCIe Gen6 retimers are also witnessing “broad traction.”\nThe data center switching business remains another catalyst with revenues expected to exceed $300 million in fiscal 2026 and top $500 million in fiscal 2027. Drivers include sustained demand for 12.8T platforms and accelerating ramps of next-generation 51.2T switches. Meanwhile, development is underway for 100T architectures, which are set to be introduced next year.\n\nThe company has been divesting non-core assets (like the Automotive Ethernet business) while layering in acquisitions, such as Avera, Aquantia , Inphi and Innovium , and now Celestial AI (expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027). Celestial AI specializes in the Photonic Fabric technology platform. This platform is purpose-built for scale-up optical interconnect. Management highlighted that Celestial AI is “deeply engaged” with several hyperscalers and ecosystem partners. Celestial AI has already won a major contract with one of the biggest hyperscalers. This hyperscaler intends to use the photonic fabric chiplets in its next-generation scale-up architecture.\nStrong cash flow and subsequent buybacks enhance Marvell’s appeal. Marvell has returned $1.35 billion through buybacks (including ASR) and dividends in the fiscal third quarter, highlighting financial flexibility even while investing.\n\nPrice Performances & Valuations of CRDO & MRVL In the past month, CRDO and MRVL have declined 15.3% and 5.2%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price/sales ratio, Credo is trading at 17.53X, higher than Marvell’s 7.44X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO? Analysts have revised earnings estimates 30% upward for CRDO for the current fiscal year in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThere is a marginal upward revision for MRVL’s bottom line\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCRDO or MRVL: Which Is a Better Pick? Credo and Marvell are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI-driven data center market.\nCRDO currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Marvell carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Is Marvell (MRVL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Marvell Technology (MRVL).\n\nMarvell currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 24 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 5.6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MRVL Check price target & stock forecast for Marvell here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Marvell, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in MRVL? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marvell, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.1% over the past month to $2.84.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marvell.

      "Content": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Is Using Debt Safely\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nDavid Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhen Is Debt A Problem? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Analog Devices Carry? The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at November 2025 Analog Devices had debt of US$8.60b, up from US$7.62b in one year. However, it also had US$3.65b in cash, and so its net debt is US$4.95b.\nHow Strong Is Analog Devices' Balance Sheet? According to the last reported balance sheet, Analog Devices had liabilities of US$3.25b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$10.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.65b in cash and US$1.44b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$9.09b.\n\nOf course, Analog Devices has a titanic market capitalization of US$135.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nStory Continues\nAnalog Devices's net debt is only 0.99 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 14.1 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, Analog Devices grew its EBIT by 45% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Analog Devices can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Analog Devices actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.\nOur View The good news is that Analog Devices's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. It looks Analog Devices has no trouble standing on its own two feet, and it has no reason to fear its lenders. For investing nerds like us its balance sheet is almost charming. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Analog Devices you should know about.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

      "Content": "【時報記者王逸芯台北報導】智原（3035）旗下小金雞、32位元微控制器（MCU）設計廠雅特力-KY（6907）預計於明年1月在櫃買中心掛牌。智原董事長、同時也是雅特力-KY董事長王國雍今日表示，目前公司營運表現相當不錯，雅特力持續深耕主流MCU應用，並從中尋找可發揮的利基市場，包括機器人、無人機以及電競等新興應用，看好今年營收可望再優於去年，對明年展望亦抱持正向態度。\n\n王國雍指出，MCU本身是一項可銷售十年以上的產品，但實際上單一客戶的使用週期可能僅兩至三年，在工控等應用中則可能拉長至十年不等，因此公司在營運評估上，會更著重整體底站與出貨結構。目前公司整體狀況良好，去年營收年增達60%，在整體MCU市場仍承壓之際，已率先繳出明顯成長成績；今年營收預期將再優於去年，且底站動能仍接近歷史高點水準，為明年營運奠定穩定基礎。\n\n王國雍進一步表示，第四季多項晶片幾乎銷售一空，目前正積極推動晶圓代工產能加量，主因新應用放量速度快，例如無人機等需求持續拉升，部分客戶甚至出現供貨吃緊的情況。從庫存面來看，無論是代理商、經銷商或終端客戶端，整體庫存水位皆偏低，也成為支撐明年營運的重要正向指標。\n\n雅特力-KY亦積極布局車用及特殊MCU應用領域。副總經理黃呈俊指出，車用市場的應用範圍相當廣泛，目前公司產品已通過AEC-Q100認證，車用應用本身也具備多個層次，公司現階段著力較多的是車載、耐用度要求較高、且具備實際出貨量的應用領域，整體車用相關營收占比約在一成多。至於AI與機器人應用，公司認為目前仍處於產業初期，但更看重其中長期成長潛力。\n\n針對MCU市場競爭態勢，王國雍表示，若晶片功能單純，確實難以做出差異化，這也是8位元市場高度內捲的主因；但在32位元MCU領域，公司採取全產品公規策略，涵蓋多元應用，即使導入車規相關設計，也不僅限於汽車市場，而是透過高規格品質驗證，提升其他高可靠度應用客戶的信任感。\n\n黃呈俊補充，所謂「內捲」在任何產業競爭中其實都是長期存在的現象，但MCU所屬產業結構相對特殊，具備少量多樣、客群分散、屬於長期且穩定的常態性市場特性，並非典型的「贏者全拿」型產業；相較外商競爭對手，公司在價格策略上更具彈性，能提供具吸引力的報價，但產品效能並不遜色。若與大陸廠商相比，公司則在產品品質與可靠度上更具優勢，這與台灣半導體產業長期累積的技術基礎與製造經驗密不可分。實務上，一項產品動輒數千美元，客戶不會因為幾毛美元的價差輕易更換供應商，因為整體系統導入涉及龐大的工程成本與時間投入，最終仍高度仰賴品牌信任與長期穩定性；也因此，即便市場競爭激烈、價格壓力升高，公司仍能在內捲環境中以產品、品質與服務正面競爭，維持長期競爭力。\n\n營收占比上，雅特力-KY 目前大陸市場營收占比約落在八成至九成之間，部分時間點甚至接近九成，不過整體結構也正逐步出現變化，這與地緣政治因素及產業供需循環有一定關聯。從國際競爭來看，主要對手為ST（意法半導體），其在疫情初期因大缺貨，與多家客戶簽訂長期供貨合約，隨著這幾年市場逐步去化，部分韓國等海外客戶的長約已陸續到期，公司在海外市場，包括韓國、台灣及亞太地區品牌的設計導入與用量明顯回升，像電競領域已成功打入全球最大電競品牌廠。整體來看，台灣與海外營收占比已由過去約一成出頭，逐步往11%、12%以上提升，但由於大陸市場營收同步成長，兩者在比例上仍呈現拉鋸狀態，目前台灣加海外合計約占十多個百分點。",

On December 16, Bank of America raised the firm’s price target on KLA Corporation to $1,450 from $1,400, while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. BofA is adjusting its price targets across the US semiconductor sector and suggests that 2026 marks the halfway point of a decade-long transition toward upgrading traditional IT infrastructure for AI-driven workloads. Stock volatility may persist as investors scrutinize AI returns and hyperscaler spending, but the firm believes that this pressure will be balanced by the expansion of AI factories and LLM developers.\n\nOn the same day, Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded KLA Corporation to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $1,500, up from $1,350. After beating the S&P 500 by 30 points in 2025, the SOX is expected to remain a market leader through 2026. Cantor Fitzgerald believes that the scale of AI infrastructure spending outweighs any short-term cyclical concerns.\nEarlier on December 15, Jefferies upgraded the company to Buy from Hold with a price target of $1,500, up from $1,100. The firm cited KLA Corporation’s dominant position in leading-edge manufacturing as AI scales and believes that the current buildout will catalyze demand for advanced chips, memory, and packaging technologies. With the stock’s valuation recently resetting to more attractive levels, Jefferies sees KLA Corporation as a primary beneficiary of the accelerating investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and markets process control, process-enabling, and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries worldwide.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Silicon Motion (SIMO) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 26, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) closed the most recent trading day at $90.23, moving +1.29% from the previous trading session. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.03% loss on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.04%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.09%.\nThe stock of chip company has risen by 1.71% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.66% and undershooting the S&P 500's gain of 2.57%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Silicon Motion in its upcoming release. On that day, Silicon Motion is projected to report earnings of $1.31 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 43.96%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $260.55 million, up 36.3% from the year-ago period.\nSIMO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.55 per share and revenue of $863.29 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +3.5% and +7.43%, respectively.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Silicon Motion. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Currently, Silicon Motion is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note Silicon Motion's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 25.09. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 25.22 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that SIMO currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.19. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.11.\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 20, finds itself in the top 9% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The standout performers have been companies aggressively pivoting to AI.\n\nIREN (IREN) led with a massive +300% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled by major GPU cloud deals and Microsoft&#x27;s backing .\nCipher Mining (CIFR) followed strongly at +230%, expanding AI hosting partnerships specifically with Fluidstack .\nHut 8 (HUT) also soared, up around +139%, capped by its recent AI announcement : a $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease for 245 MW at its River Bend site in Louisiana.\nIn contrast, three of the four largest bitcoin holders among public miners underperformed the AI/HPC miners.\nMarathon Digital (MARA), the top BTC hodler among miners with 53,250 BTC, dropped -44% YTD. CleanSpark (CLSK) (13,011 BTC) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) (19,324 BTC) saw modest gains of 16% and 32% respectively, without aggressive AI diversification until much later in the year.\n\nCore Scientific (CORZ) stayed independent after shareholders rejected a $9 billion all-stock takeover bid from CoreWeave in October, betting on higher standalone value amid AI demand. Its shares are up just 9% year-to-date.\nBitdeer Technologies (BTDR), the biggest underperforming mining company in the sector, is down around 50%. The bulk of the losses came after its Q3 earnings announcement, when the company reported a larger-than-anticipated net loss and disclosed a delay to its ASIC chip, adding uncertainty around its AI expansion plans.\nThis year underscored a clear trend: miners repurposing sites for AI data centers which outperformed pure-play bitcoin operators.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAnalog Devices, Inc. ADI, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Fortive Corp. FTV.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Buy 3 Tech Stocks as Santa Claus Rally Gets Underway The Santa Claus rally appears to have finally taken off, with tech stocks rebounding after a roller-coaster ride over the past month. Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. , Amazon.com, Inc. and Fortive Corp. , which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks with Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc. Analog Devices, Inc. is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.

      "Content": "Returns At Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) Are On The Way Up\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 26, 2025 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nIf you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Tower Semiconductor ( NASDAQ:TSEM ) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Tower Semiconductor, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.057 = US$170m ÷ (US$3.3b - US$269m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025) .\nSo, Tower Semiconductor has an ROCE of 5.7%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Semiconductor industry average of 8.9%.\nView our latest analysis for Tower Semiconductor\nIn the above chart we have measured Tower Semiconductor's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Tower Semiconductor .\nHow Are Returns Trending? We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 5.7%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 73%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\n\nThe Bottom Line A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Tower Semiconductor has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 374% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Tower Semiconductor looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The intrinsic value infographic for TSEM helps visualize whether it is currently trading for a fair price.\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Within this context, Morgan Stanley touched upon the analog chips sector, saying the outlook is slowly improving. In this sector, the firm expressed a preference for NXP Semiconductors N.V.

      "Content": "NXP Semiconductors' (NASDAQ:NXPI) investors will be pleased with their favorable 54% return over the last three years\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 23, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nInvestors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the NXP Semiconductors N.V. ( NASDAQ:NXPI ) share price return of 45% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 6.9% in the last year.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nOver the last three years, NXP Semiconductors failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 6.8% (annualized).\nThus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.\n\nThe modest 1.8% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. You can only imagine how long term shareholders feel about the declining revenue trend (slipping at 2.8% per year). What's clear is that historic earnings and revenue aren't matching up with the share price action, very well. So you might have to dig deeper to get a grasp of the situation\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nNXP Semiconductors is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates .\nWhat About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of NXP Semiconductors, it has a TSR of 54% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory Continues\nA Different Perspective NXP Semiconductors provided a TSR of 8.9% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 10% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - NXP Semiconductors has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "SVP Sells 4,945 Skyworks Solutions Shares Worth $308,000\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nDecember 22, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nKey Points The sale represented about 20% of Robert John Terry's holdings.\nTerry made three open-market sales over the past year.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nOn November 19, 2025, Robert John Terry, SVP, Gen. Counsel & Secretary of Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) , reported the sale of 4,945 shares in multiple open-market transactions, as disclosed in a SEC Form 4 filing .\n\nTransaction summary Metric\nValue\nShares sold\n4,945\nTransaction value\n~$308,000\nPost-transaction shares\n19,824\nPost-transaction value (direct ownership)\n~$1.2 million\n\nTransaction value based on SEC Form 4 weighted average purchase price ($62.28); post-transaction value based on Nov. 19, 2025 market close ($62.28).\nKey questions How significant was this sale relative to Robert John Terry’s direct holdings?\nThis transaction represented 19.96% of Terry’s direct shareholdings immediately prior to the sale, reducing his ownership from 24,769 to 19,824 shares. This is consistent with his median sell size over the past year.\nDoes this sale align with Terry’s historical trading patterns?\nIn the past year, Terry has made three open-market sales, each accounting for a substantial proportion of his remaining capacity, as his direct holdings have declined by 49.2% since November of last year. The current sale matches the recent median of 4,945 shares per trade.\nHow does the transaction value compare to current and historical stock prices?\nThe weighted average sale price was $62.28, just below the market close of $62.59 on November 19, 2025, and 1.2% lower than the current price of $63.05 as of November 24, 2025. Over the preceding twelve months, shares have declined 24.69% on a total return basis.\nWhat is Terry’s remaining exposure to Skyworks Solutions after this transaction?\nPost-transaction, Terry retains direct ownership of 19,824 shares, valued at approximately $1.2 million as of November 19, 2025.\n\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close 11/19/2025)\n$62.59\nMarket capitalization\n$9.31 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$4.09 billion\n1-year price change\n-25.10%\n\n* 1-year price change calculated using November 19, 2025 as the reference date.\nCompany snapshot Offers a broad portfolio of semiconductor products, including amplifiers, filters, front-end modules, and analog system-on-chip solutions.\nGenerates revenue by designing, manufacturing, and selling proprietary semiconductor components to a diversified set of end-markets.\nServes customers across the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, and wearable device markets.\n\nStory Continues\nSkyworks Solutions operates at scale with over 10,000 employees and a global footprint in the semiconductor industry. The company leverages proprietary technology and an extensive product portfolio to address high-growth connectivity and communications markets. Its strategic focus on diversified end-markets and integrated solutions positions Skyworks as a key supplier to leading OEMs and infrastructure providers worldwide.\n\nFoolish take As previously mentioned, Robert John Terry’s sale of Skyworks stock coincides with numerous sales transactions among executives at the company. Although Terry chose to retain a significant number of shares, the size of the transaction relative to his position may point to concerns.\nThe challenge investors face is determining whether the issue is related to the company or the industry in general. The state of the stock may point to the latter. One of its more prominent competitors, Texas Instruments , experienced a similar decline in its stock.\n\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is in the midst of a significant growth phase due to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Even the most advanced of these AI chips needs the RF and connectivity components like the ones Skyworks produces to power the broader ecosystem.\nAdditionally, Skyworks sells at a P/E ratio of 20, around the five-year average for its valuation. That earnings multiple could eventually bode well for attracting new investors to the company as the advancements continue.\nGlossary Form 4: A required SEC filing disclosing insider transactions in a company’s securities.\nOpen-market transaction: The purchase or sale of securities on a public exchange, not through private or pre-arranged deals.\nInsider: A company executive, director, or major shareholder with access to non-public company information.\nDirect ownership: Shares held and controlled directly by an individual, not through trusts or indirect arrangements.\nWeighted average price: The average price of shares sold or bought, weighted by the number of shares at each price.\nMedian sell size: The middle value of all insider sale amounts over a period, used to show typical transaction size.\nTotal return: The investment's price change plus all dividends and distributions, assuming those payouts are reinvested.\nOEM: Original Equipment Manufacturer; a company that produces parts or equipment used in another company’s end products.\nProprietary technology: Technology owned and controlled by a company, often protected by patents or trade secrets.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Wall Street Analysts Think Silicon Motion (SIMO) Is a Good Investment: Is It?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 22, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nThe recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Silicon Motion (SIMO).\n\nSilicon Motion currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.30, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 10 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.30 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 10 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 10% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SIMO Check price target & stock forecast for Silicon Motion here>>>\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Silicon Motion, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs SIMO Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Silicon Motion, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.55.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Silicon Motion. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Silicon Motion.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Is Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 22, 2025 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nKey Insights Cirrus Logic's estimated fair value is US$91.95 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$121 suggests Cirrus Logic is potentially 32% overvalued\nThe US$140 analyst price target for CRUS is 52% more than our estimate of fair value\nDoes the December share price for Cirrus Logic, Inc. ( NASDAQ:CRUS ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model .\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThe Calculation We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$369.8m\nUS$399.5m\nUS$392.3m\nUS$391.6m\nUS$394.9m\nUS$401.1m\nUS$409.4m\nUS$419.3m\nUS$430.6m\nUS$442.9m\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x1\nAnalyst x1\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ -0.19%\nEst @ 0.84%\nEst @ 1.57%\nEst @ 2.08%\nEst @ 2.43%\nEst @ 2.68%\nEst @ 2.85%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11%\nUS$334\nUS$327\nUS$290\nUS$262\nUS$239\nUS$220\nUS$203\nUS$188\nUS$174\nUS$162\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.4b\n\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$443m× (1 + 3.3%) ÷ (11%– 3.3%) = US$6.3b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$6.3b÷ ( 1 + 11%) 10 = US$2.3b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.7b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$121, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nImportant Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cirrus Logic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.581. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Cirrus Logic\nSWOT Analysis for Cirrus Logic Strength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nCurrently debt free.\nWeakness\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nOpportunity\nCRUS' financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nLooking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

(NASDAQ: SWKS ) is one of the 10 Most Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Invest in . On December 11, Thomas O’Kalley of Barclays maintained his Hold rating on Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) stock, along with the price target of $88. This price target remains well above the median price target of $75 and offers 31% upside from the current level.\n\nSWKS has struggled since the announcement of the merger with Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), but the stock has been rallying for the past month, and Barclays’ $88 price target may add further to the bullish sentiment. Investors were possibly spooked by the amount of time it may take for the merger to financially benefit the company. The merger is expected to be executed by early 2027, with about $500 million in cost savings expected by 2028-2029. The cash-and-stock transaction is weighing heavily on the stock, as is the risk of regulatory approval.\nThe regulatory risk stems from the fact that both Skyworks and Qorvo are competitors and significant suppliers for one company: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). A merger would reduce competition in RF components, increasing Apple’s dependence on a single supplier. This reduced competition is generally bad for the end consumer, which is why regulators usually side with companies like Apple in such merger scenarios.\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) specializes in radio-frequency and analog solutions. These products enable wireless connectivity across industrial applications, automotive systems, and smartphones, among other things. It is based in Irvine, California.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

On December 16, Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) and raised the price target from $255 to $265. According to estimates from 34 analysts covering the stock on Wall Street, the stock has a median upside target of $265, exactly where BofA’s price target now stands.\nCantor Fitzgerald Research also made some comments on the semiconductor industry on December 16, expecting relative outperformance from NXPI stock. These two positive analyst responses come at a time when investors are fearing negative sentiment as a result of news coming out of Chandler, where the company’s ECHO fab used to manufacture parts for 5G equipment.\nAccording to an NXP spokesperson who spoke to Business Journal on December 13:\nThe Chandler facility is expected to close by 2027 after a lack of ROI on investments amid lower-than-expected global 5G deployments. The firm will completely exit the radio power market while scaling down operations at the Chandler fab.\nNXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a designer and manufacturer of semiconductor equipment based in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

      "Content": "Is There an Opportunity in STMicroelectronics After Recent Semiconductor Cycle Sentiment Shift?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 20, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: STM\n\nSTMEF\n\nIf you are wondering whether STMicroelectronics is a bargain or a value trap at current levels, this article will walk you through what the numbers really say about the stock.\nThe share price has been volatile, down 0.8% over the last week but still up 14.7% in the past month, even though it remains negative year to date and over the last few years.\nRecent attention around the semiconductor cycle, including renewed interest in automotive and industrial chips and ongoing discussion about supply chain resilience, has helped shift sentiment toward established European chipmakers like STMicroelectronics. Investors are weighing whether these structural demand drivers can offset concerns about cyclicality and global competition.\nRight now, STMicroelectronics scores a 3 out of 6 on our valuation checks. This suggests the market may be underestimating it in a few key areas, but not across the board. We will unpack those methods next and then highlight a potentially more effective way to assess its value by the end of the article.\n\nSTMicroelectronics delivered -5.0% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: STMicroelectronics Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth today by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and discounting those cash flows back to the present.\nFor STMicroelectronics, the latest twelve month free cash flow is negative at around $746 million. This reflects heavy investment and cyclicality in the business rather than mature, steady cash generation. Analysts currently forecast free cash flow to rebound strongly, with projections reaching about $1.83 billion by 2028. Beyond the initial analyst window, Simply Wall St extrapolates cash flows out to ten years using gradually slowing growth assumptions that match a maturing semiconductor business.\n\nWhen these projected cash flows are discounted using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the intrinsic value comes out at roughly €25.84 per share. This implies the stock is about 14.2% undervalued relative to the current market price and suggests investors are not fully pricing in the expected cash flow recovery.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests STMicroelectronics is undervalued by 14.2%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 914 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for STMicroelectronics.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: STMicroelectronics Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like STMicroelectronics, the price to earnings ratio is a useful way to gauge what investors are willing to pay today for each unit of current earnings. In general, faster and more reliable earnings growth, along with lower perceived risk, tends to justify a higher, or more generous, PE multiple. Slower growth or higher uncertainty usually warrants a lower one.\n\nSTMicroelectronics currently trades on about 43.0x earnings, which is above the broader Semiconductor industry average of roughly 34.9x, but below the peer group average of around 56.1x. To move beyond these simple comparisons, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio that estimates what PE the company should trade on after accounting for its earnings growth outlook, profit margins, industry profile, market cap and company specific risks. This tailored benchmark is more robust than relying solely on peer or industry averages, which can be distorted by outliers or different business models.\nFor STMicroelectronics, the Fair Ratio is 45.2x, slightly above the current 43.0x. That points to a modest valuation gap, suggesting the shares look somewhat cheap relative to what its fundamentals imply.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1465 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your STMicroelectronics Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simple, story driven views you create on Simply Wall St’s Community page that connect your assumptions about STMicroelectronics’ future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast, a fair value estimate and ultimately a buy or sell decision. You do this by comparing that fair value to today’s price, updating automatically when fresh news or earnings arrive. One investor who believes STM’s EV, industrial automation and AI design wins will drive faster growth and margin expansion might set a higher fair value around €31. A more cautious investor focused on China competition, inventory risk and FX headwinds might settle closer to €20, with both Narratives living side by side on the platform as dynamic, easy to use guides for their next move.\nDo you think there's more to the story for STMicroelectronics?

      "Content": "Silicon Motion (NasdaqGS:SIMO): Assessing Valuation After Strong Earnings Momentum and Upbeat Growth Expectations\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 18, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nSilicon Motion Technology (SIMO) has been back on traders screens after a steady run of earnings beats and expectations for roughly 44% year over year profit growth this quarter, even as parts of the chip sector lag.\nSee our latest analysis for Silicon Motion Technology.\nThe stock has been choppy lately, with a 1 day share price return of 2.39% lifting it to 86.56. The standout figure is the roughly 58% year to date share price return and 65.63% one year total shareholder return, signaling that positive earnings momentum is still very much in play.\n\nGiven how SIMO has ridden the semiconductor upcycle, this could be a good moment to see what else is working in chips and hardware via high growth tech and AI stocks .\nYet with the shares still trading well below consensus price targets after such a strong run, investors are left to wonder: is Silicon Motion undervalued on its earnings momentum, or has the market already priced in the next leg of growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 24.1% Undervalued With Silicon Motion Technology closing at 86.56 versus a widely followed fair value of 114, the prevailing narrative leans toward meaningful upside from here.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how this story gets to triple digit fair value? The crux is aggressive profit growth, expanding margins, and a future earnings multiple that assumes real execution. Want to see the exact trajectory behind that conviction and where the narrative thinks growth peaks? Dive into the full breakdown and test those assumptions for yourself.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $114 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, execution missteps on next generation controllers or sharper than expected price competition could quickly undermine the upbeat growth and margin narrative around SIMO.\nFind out about the key risks to this Silicon Motion Technology narrative.\nAnother View: Cash Flows Tell a Different Story While the narrative based on future earnings points to upside, our DCF model is much more cautious, putting fair value closer to 36.82, well below the current 86.56 share price. If cash flows are right and optimism is wrong, how much margin of safety is really left?\n\n繼續閱讀\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out Silicon Motion Technology for example ). We show the entire calculation in full. You can track the result in your watchlist or portfolio and be alerted when this changes, or use our stock screener to discover 916 undervalued stocks based on their cash flows .

      "Content": "Does Silicon Motion Still Offer Value After a 67.4% Surge and AI Storage Hype?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 18, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nWondering if Silicon Motion Technology is still a smart buy after its big run, or if most of the upside is already priced in? Let us unpack what the market might be missing about its value.\nThe stock is up an impressive 58.1% year to date and 67.4% over the last year, even after a recent 7.3% pullback over the past week that hints at some renewed uncertainty and opportunity.\nMuch of the recent move has been driven by optimism around demand for NAND flash controllers and broader AI related storage needs, which has pushed investors to reassess the company’s growth runway. At the same time, shifting sentiment in the semiconductor space and ongoing consolidation talk have added a layer of speculation alongside fundamentals.\nOn our valuation framework, Silicon Motion Technology scores a 3/6 for being undervalued. You can explore this in more detail via its valuation score . Next, we will walk through what different valuation approaches say about the stock, before closing with an even more intuitive way to think about its true worth.\n\nSilicon Motion Technology delivered 67.4% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: Silicon Motion Technology Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a business is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those cash flows back to today in dollar terms.\nFor Silicon Motion Technology, the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model starts from last twelve months free cash flow of about $0.49 million and uses analyst forecasts out to 2027, then extrapolates further. By 2026, free cash flow is projected at roughly $137.93 million, easing to around $121.61 million by 2035 as growth moderates from early analyst expectations to steadier long term levels.\n\nDiscounting this stream of cash flows back to today yields an estimated intrinsic value of about $36.77 per share. Compared with the current share price, this suggests the stock is roughly 135.0% above its DCF based fair value, indicating that recent optimism may already be more than reflected in the price.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Silicon Motion Technology may be overvalued by 135.0%. Discover 918 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Silicon Motion Technology.\nApproach 2: Silicon Motion Technology Price vs Earnings For a consistently profitable business like Silicon Motion Technology, the price to earnings, or PE, ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are paying for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower or more volatile earnings growth tend to pull a fair multiple down.\n\nStory Continues\nSilicon Motion currently trades on a PE of about 30.45x, which is below the broader Semiconductor industry average of roughly 36.11x and well below the peer group average of around 67.38x. On the surface, that discount could suggest the market is still somewhat cautious about the company’s earnings durability and growth profile.\n\nTo move beyond simple comparisons, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary Fair Ratio of 28.37x for Silicon Motion. This reflects its specific mix of earnings growth, margins, size, industry positioning and risk factors. This tailored benchmark is more informative than raw industry or peer averages, which can be skewed by very high growth or speculative names. With the stock’s actual PE sitting modestly above this Fair Ratio, the market appears to be pricing Silicon Motion at a slight premium to what its fundamentals imply.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1455 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Silicon Motion Technology Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, an easy framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that helps you turn your view of Silicon Motion Technology into a clear story. You can link that story to specific revenue, earnings and margin forecasts, and then translate those forecasts into a fair value you can compare to today’s price to decide whether to buy, hold or sell. The system keeps your Narrative dynamically updated as fresh earnings or news arrives. One investor might build a bullish Narrative that sees fair value closer to around $114 per share based on strong AI driven storage demand and margin expansion. Another might create a more cautious Narrative that anchors nearer to about $80 per share due to competitive and geopolitical risks. Both perspectives can coexist transparently, grounded in explicit assumptions rather than vague opinions.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Silicon Motion Technology?

      "Content": "Weak Financial Prospects Seem To Be Dragging Down Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Stock\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 17, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nIt is hard to get excited after looking at Skyworks Solutions' (NASDAQ:SWKS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 11% over the past three months. We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Skyworks Solutions' ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nHow Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Skyworks Solutions is:\n8.3% = US$477m ÷ US$5.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2025).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Skyworks Solutions' Earnings Growth And 8.3% ROE On the face of it, Skyworks Solutions' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 11% either. For this reason, Skyworks Solutions' five year net income decline of 18% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.\nHowever, when we compared Skyworks Solutions' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 5.3% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.\n\nStory Continues\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is SWKS fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Skyworks Solutions Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? Skyworks Solutions' declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 53% (or a retention ratio of 47%). With only very little left to reinvest into the business, growth in earnings is far from likely.\n\nAdditionally, Skyworks Solutions has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 50%. Still, forecasts suggest that Skyworks Solutions' future ROE will rise to 12% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.\nSummary Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Skyworks Solutions. The company has seen a lack of earnings growth as a result of retaining very little profits and whatever little it does retain, is being reinvested at a very low rate of return. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

      "Content": "Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 17, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Silicon Motion falls in, has lost 6.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 points to a change of +3.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.88 indicates a change of +37.5% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Silicon Motion.\n\nLire la suite\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate of $260.55 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +36.3%. The $863.29 million and $1.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.4% and +21.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $242 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.07 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.52%. The EPS surprise was +23.46%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(SWKS) designs, manufactures, and markets a broad range of high-performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors that enable wireless connectivity. With a market cap of $9.8 billion, the company’s operations span the US, Indo-Pacific, and EMEA region.\n\nCompanies worth between $2 billion and $10 billion are generally described as \"mid-cap stocks.\" SWKS fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size and influence in the semiconductor industry.\nMore News from Barchart While AI Panic Struck Applied Digital (APLD) Stock, the Smart Money Has a Different View\nJPMorgan Says to Sell NVDA March $160 Puts.

Sign up now!\nSkyworks touched its 52-week high of $95.46 on Jan. 21 and is currently trading 30.8% below that peak. Meanwhile, SWKS stock has declined 11.1% over the past three months, notably lagging behind the iShares Semiconductor ETF’s (SOXX) 14.6% surge during the same time frame.\nSkyworks’ performance has remained grim over the longer term as well. SWKS stock has plunged 25.6% on a YTD basis and 27.3% over the past 52 weeks, significantly underperforming SOXX’s 37.5% surge in 2025 and 30.2% returns over the past year.\nSWKS stock has traded mostly below its 200-day moving average over the past year, with some notable fluctuations and consistently below its 50-day moving average since early November, underscoring its bearish trend.\nSkyworks Solutions’ stock prices gained more than 2% in the trading session following the release of its impressive Q4 results on Nov. 4. During the quarter, the company secured 5G content across premium Android smartphones, including Google Pixel 10, Samsung Galaxy S25, and others. Further, it also expanded in-vehicle infotainment programs with BYD, Stellantis, and a leading Korean OEM.\n\nMeanwhile, Skyworks reported a notable 7.3% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.1 billion, beating the Street’s expectations by a significant margin. Moreover, SWKS delivered a notable 13.5% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.76, surpassing the consensus estimates by more than 15%.\nNonetheless, Skyworks has also underperformed its peer, Analog Devices, Inc.’s (ADI) 31% surge in 2025 and 28.7% returns over the past 52 weeks.\nAmong the 25 analysts covering the SWKS stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” Its mean price target of $84.56 suggests a 28.1% upside potential from current price levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Sarawgi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Does Qorvo’s 2025 Rebound and 28.2% Surge Justify Its Current Valuation?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 12, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QRVO\n\nWondering if Qorvo at around $89 is quietly becoming a value play or still a risky semiconductor bet? This breakdown is designed to help you decide without the jargon.\nThe stock is up 0.5% over the last week, 3.3% over the past month, and 28.2% year to date, but those gains still sit against a 5 year return of about -44.0%.\nRecently, Qorvo has stayed in the spotlight as investors focus on the long term demand for radio frequency chips in smartphones, 5G infrastructure, and connected devices. In addition, ongoing attention on reshoring and semiconductor supply chains continues to shape how the market prices companies like Qorvo.\nDespite all that interest, Qorvo only scores 1/6 on our valuation checks . We will walk through what different valuation methods are actually saying about the stock, then finish with a more holistic way to think about its real worth.\n\nQorvo scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Qorvo Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a business is worth today by projecting the cash it could generate in the future, then discounting those cash flows back to the present.\nFor Qorvo, the model starts with last twelve months free cash flow of about $539 million. Analysts provide detailed forecasts for the next few years, and beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates further out to build a 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Under these assumptions, Qorvo’s free cash flow is projected to rise to around $730 million by 2035, still in dollar terms.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the intrinsic value is estimated at roughly $74.31 per share. With the stock trading near $89, the DCF output implies Qorvo is about 20.3% overvalued on this cash flow outlook.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Qorvo may be overvalued by 20.3%. Discover 903 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Qorvo.\nApproach 2: Qorvo Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Qorvo, the price to earnings (PE) ratio is a useful shorthand for how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster earnings growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tend to pull that multiple down.\n\nQorvo currently trades on a PE of about 38.0x, which is roughly in line with the broader Semiconductor industry average of around 38.0x, but above the peer group average near 34.5x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio of 29.1x for Qorvo, which represents the PE you might expect given its specific mix of earnings growth, margins, industry positioning, market cap and risk profile.\n\nLeer más\nThis Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or sector averages because it adjusts for Qorvo’s own fundamentals rather than assuming it deserves the same multiple as every other chip company. With the shares at 38.0x versus a Fair Ratio of 29.1x, the multiple based view suggests Qorvo is trading at a premium to what its fundamentals currently justify.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1447 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Qorvo Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This is a simple framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you tell the story behind your numbers by linking your view of Qorvo’s future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast, a fair value estimate and a clear buy or sell signal. That fair value is compared to today’s price and then dynamically updated when new information, like merger news or earnings, comes in. For example, a bullish investor might build a Narrative that leans into 5G, 6G and merger synergies to justify a fair value closer to the high end of recent targets near $128. A more cautious investor could emphasize customer concentration, regulatory risk and handset cyclicality to land nearer the low end around $70. Both perspectives can coexist on the platform as approachable, side by side stories that may make it easier to decide whether Qorvo at about $89 appears attractively priced, fully valued, or too expensive for a given personal outlook.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Qorvo?

      "Content": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Cirrus Logic (CRUS) is a Great Choice\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 10, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nMomentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the \"long context,\" investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Cirrus Logic (CRUS) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Cirrus Logic currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market? Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CRUS that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor CRUS, shares are up 2.89% over the past week while the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry is up 4.96% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.11% compares favorably with the industry's 4.17% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Cirrus Logic have increased 5.57% over the past quarter, and have gained 18.64% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.34% and 14.25%, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors should also pay attention to CRUS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CRUS is currently averaging 478,999 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CRUS.\nOver the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CRUS's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.07 to $7.73 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CRUS is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B.

      "Content": "Is It Too Late To Consider Tower Semiconductor After Its 140% 2025 Rally?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 9, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nIf you are wondering whether Tower Semiconductor is still a smart buy after such a huge run up in its share price, or if you might be late to the party, this article will break down what the current valuation is actually telling us.\nThe stock has surged recently, climbing 6.5% over the last week, 47.5% over the past month, and an eye catching 140.5% year to date, while delivering a 384.0% gain over 5 years.\nThose moves have been driven by growing investor enthusiasm around analog and specialty semiconductor demand, as well as Tower's strategic positioning as a foundry partner for companies that want alternatives to the largest chip manufacturers. At the same time, shifting expectations about industry consolidation and long term chip demand cycles have added a layer of both excitement and volatility to the story.\nDespite that performance, Tower Semiconductor currently scores just 0/6 on our undervaluation checks. In this article we will walk through what different valuation approaches say about the stock today, and then wrap up by looking at a more holistic way to think about its overall worth.\n\nTower Semiconductor scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Tower Semiconductor Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a business is worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back into today’s dollars using a required rate of return.\nFor Tower Semiconductor, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company is currently generating negative free cash flow of about $25.1 Million, but analysts and extrapolations see this swinging to positive territory and then scaling materially. Projections point to free cash flow reaching roughly $34.3 Million in 2026 and climbing to about $1.43 Billion by 2035, all in $ terms. Simply Wall St only uses direct analyst estimates for the early years, then extrapolates further growth based on recent trends.\n\nAfter discounting this stream of future cash flows, the DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of around $63.19 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies the stock is about 96.2% overvalued.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Tower Semiconductor may be overvalued by 96.2%. Discover 903 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Tower Semiconductor.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: Tower Semiconductor Price vs Earnings For a profitable business like Tower Semiconductor, the price to earnings (PE) ratio is a useful way to see how much investors are willing to pay today for each dollar of current earnings. It ties directly to what the company is actually making now, which makes it more intuitive than cash flow models for many investors.\n\nWhat counts as a “normal” PE depends on how quickly earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher growth and lower perceived risk usually justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tend to hold the PE down.\nTower currently trades on a PE of 71.2x, which is well above both the Semiconductor industry average of 38.0x and the average of its peers at 44.5x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 45.6x, which is the PE you might expect once you factor in Tower’s specific mix of earnings growth, profitability, industry, market cap and risk profile. Because this Fair Ratio is tailored to Tower, it is more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry.\nWith the current PE of 71.2x sitting materially above the 45.6x Fair Ratio, the shares look expensive on this metric.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1450 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Tower Semiconductor Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you turn your view of a company into a story tied to a financial forecast and a fair value. You can compare that fair value with the current price and decide when to buy or sell. You can also track how it updates automatically as new news or earnings arrive, and even see how different investors can look at the same Tower Semiconductor data and reach very different conclusions. For example, one Narrative might lean bullish, assuming accelerating RF Infrastructure and Silicon Photonics growth that justifies a fair value closer to $124 or even $135. A more cautious Narrative might focus on capital intensity, execution and concentration risks and land nearer the low $59 to $60 range. Both perspectives use the same building blocks of future revenues, margins and multiples, just arranged into different, clearly explained stories behind the numbers.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Tower Semiconductor?

The full narrative unpacks the bold forecasts behind that fair value and why 2027 could be a turning point for Tower’s earnings mix.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $124 (ABOUT RIGHT)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, execution missteps on Tower’s heavy CapEx buildout, or a faster than expected shift in optical transceiver technologies, could quickly challenge today’s optimistic assumptions.\nFind out about the key risks to this Tower Semiconductor narrative.\nBuild Your Own Tower Semiconductor Narrative If the consensus story does not fully resonate or you prefer to dig into the numbers yourself, you can build a custom view in minutes, Do it your way .\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 1 key reward investors are optimistic about regarding Tower Semiconductor.\nLooking for your next investing edge?

The new family of products brings Cirrus Logic’s proven expertise in consumer and smartphone haptics to the automotive space, enabling a more consistent, immersive and intuitive tactile user experience across a wide range of in-cabin interfaces.\n\nAs automakers look to elevate and differentiate vehicles with personalized, immersive experiences, haptics-enabled smart surfaces play a critical role in enabling premium interior designs that are sleek, modern and sustainable. Cirrus Logic’s closed-loop technology improves actuator response, creates a wider range of haptics effects and delivers consistent performance across varying conditions. This ensures high-definition haptic feedback on interactive displays, steering wheels, smart surfaces, center consoles, smart seats and more.\n\"Consumers expect a high level of responsiveness from haptics experiences. Early adoption of haptics in vehicles was not intuitive or consistently reliable, and didn’t deliver a realistic tactile experience,\" said Vlad Bulavsky, Director, Automotive Solutions, Cirrus Logic. \"Cirrus Logic’s new low latency, closed-loop haptics technology addresses this challenge for automotive designers who are redefining how we interact with our cars and take user experience to the next level.\"\n\n\"As screens replace physical controls in vehicles, the industry has recognized the need for sophisticated tactile feedback to bridge the gap,\" said Peter Cooney, Chief Technology Analyst at DATAportl, a leading market research provider. \"We are moving past basic vibration to advanced, high-definition haptics that simulate physical textures and clicks. This shift is essential for reducing distraction and is the primary force driving the automotive haptics market today.\"\nCirrus Logic’s CS40L51/52/53 family offers a range of features satisfying different use cases and budgets. It simplifies the design process for engineers by integrating key components into an efficient solution. The drivers’ advanced closed-loop hardware and algorithm improve the response time of the actuator and expand usable frequency bandwidth to create a wider range of haptic effects. These new haptics solutions support a broader range of tactile effects and enable new and better ways to leverage haptics for automotive user experiences.\n\nStory Continues\nCS40L51 – Combines advanced Sensor-less Velocity Control (SVC), real-time audio to haptics synchronization (A2H) and active vibration compensation (AVC) for immersive, high-fidelity feedback.\nCS40L52 – Features the advanced closed-loop control SVC that optimizes the system's haptic performance in real-time by reducing response time, increasing frequency bandwidth and compensating for manufacturing tolerances and temperature variation.\n\nCS40L53 – Features the Click Compensation algorithm to enable consistent haptic feedback across systems by adjusting haptic effects based on the actuator manufacturing characteristics.\nBy leveraging Cirrus Logic’s deep expertise in signal processing and consumer electronics, the CS40L51/52/53 drivers provide automotive designers with a scalable platform for both current and future generations of haptic-enabled automotive solutions.\nKey Benefits\nConsistent haptics performance across manufacturing and temperature variation through advance closed-loop algorithms\nWider frequency range of haptics feedback compared to a conventional system enabling new user experiences and textured effects\nIntuitive high-definition haptics feedback enabled by the advanced closed-loop algorithm which improves the actuator response time\nHaptics tools that simplify waveform design to accelerate development cycles\nReliability qualified in accordance with the AEC Q100 standard to support a wide range of automotive applications\n\nAvailability\nEngineering samples of CS40L51, CS40L52 and CS40L53 are available now, with mass production expected to begin in December 2025.
