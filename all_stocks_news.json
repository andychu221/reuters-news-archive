      "Content": "December jobs numbers get data back on track during first full week of trading in 2026: What to watch\n\nJake Conley · Breaking Business News Reporter\nUpdated Sun, January 4, 2026 at 4:45 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\nMSM\n\nJEF\n\n^IXIC\n\nAPLD\n\nStocks finished trading on Friday — the second-to-last session of the \"Santa Claus rally\" period — with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) leading the major indexes higher to open the new year as investors began to evaluate the 2026 landscape.\nFor the holiday-abbreviated week, the blue-chip Dow led the way up with a gain of 319 points, or 0.66%. The benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) picked up 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) finished just barely below the flatline in a session that saw several of the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks stumble while semiconductor names soared .\n\nIn the week ahead, the first full week of trading in 2026 will see economic data get back on track after last year's multi-month disruption following the 43-day government shutdown that spanned all of October and about half of November.\nOn Friday, the December jobs report is expected to show a slowdown in hiring in the final month of 2025, with economists expecting nonfarm payrolls to grow by 55,000, down from November's job gains of 64,000. The unemployment rate, which hit a four-year high of 4.6% in November, is expected to fall by 0.1%.\n\nElsewhere on the calendar, ADP's monthly private payrolls report, monthly job cuts data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, and the weekly report on initial jobless claims will round out a heavy focus on the labor market to start the month.\nAll of this jobs data will be closely watched for any impacts on bets that the Federal Reserve cuts rates when it meets later this month, though data from the CME Group as of Friday showed traders pricing in an 85% chance that the Fed keeps rates in their current range of 3.5%-3.75%.\nOn the Federal Reserve front, investors will also be alert to any announcements from President Trump on his nomination to succeed Fed Chair Jay Powell, whose term leading the central bank expires in May. The president said late last month that he expected to name Powell's replacement in early January.\n\nReadings on service sector activity and consumer sentiment will round out the economic data calendar in the coming week, while the earnings calendar will remain light, with Constellation Brands ( STZ ), Albertsons ( ACI ), Jefferies Financial Group ( JEF ), and Applied Digital ( APLD ) the most notable names set to report quarterly results this coming week.\nBig banks are expected to get earnings season underway in earnest in a little less than two weeks.\n'A perennial gale of creative destruction' Despite — or perhaps because of — the year's ups and downs, 2025 was quite good to investors .\n\nStory Continues\nThe benchmark S&P 500 rose over 16% for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite led gains with a more than 20% jump. And this after a sharp downturn in April that threatened to send the markets spiraling into a bear market in a matter of days.\n\"The economy showed remarkable strength by overcoming higher inflation, a slowing labor market, fewer rate cuts than originally expected, and a sharp rise in the effective tariff rate,\" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in emailed commentary.\nNvidia ( NVDA ), the dominant chipmaker globally, saw its stock rise more than 30%, while fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" giant Google ( GOOG ) led the group of tech giants, rising more than 60%. Notably, these two stocks were the only members of the Mag 7 to outperform the S&P 500 last year.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer argued in the bank's 2026 global outlook report that while valuations are lofty and stock prices have increased sharply, the tech sector's growth isn't solely an AI story with no other legs.\nInstead, the sector's performance has been running since the financial crisis and \"has been supported by superior profit growth.\" Valuations, he wrote, also aren't as extreme as in previous bubbles, such as the heights reached during the dot-com bubble through the turn of the 21st century, and speculation isn't as irrational as it was in those earlier periods.\n\n\"The ascent of technology in terms of size and influence, particularly in the US equity market, has been a function of extraordinary fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation about the future,\" Oppenheimer wrote.\nOverall, Wall Street strategists see the S&P 500 rising 10%, on average, in the year ahead, according to Bank of America.\nThe question for investors in 2026 is whether the tech- and AI-themed upward push we've seen in markets will continue — even with the moves last year showing investors, on a single-stock level, starting to move away from the Mag 7 leadership group.\nHSBC equity strategist Nicole Inui wrote in the firm's 2026 outlook that 2025's stock market strength was \"a concentrated rally, not broad-based.\" Inui noted that the equal-weighted S&P 500 underperformed the market cap-weighted S&P 500 for the third year in a row, with tech accounting for around 90% of returns after the bounce that followed President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcements and his subsequent walk-back.\n\nBut this leadership position also doesn't mean the strength of those companies is unsustainable.\nIn a note to clients, Comerica Wealth Management CIO Eric Teal compared today's market to a \"perennial gale,\" a phrase coined by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter.\n\"The capitalist economy is often swept by a ' Perennial gale of creative destruction ' — a gale of innovation,\" Teal wrote. \"However, this advancement is a natural process of industrial mutation that leads to dramatic economic changes but also enormous benefits to society and business.\"\nHow that \"perennial gale\" sweeps through the market in 2026, at a moment when the AI trade is already heated and facing real-world stumbling blocks, is likely to be the most closely watched storyline for investors.\nEconomic and earnings calendar Monday Economic data: ISM manufacturing, December (48.4 expected, 48.2 previously)\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nTuesday Economic data: S&P Global US services PMI, December final reading (52.9 expected, 52.9 previously); S&P Global US composite PMI, December final reading (53.0 previously)\nEarnings calendar: AAR Corp.

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in 2026 That Could Be Better Picks Than Palantir\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 4:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nGOOG\n\nMU\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Google parent Alphabet covers nearly all of the bases in AI.\nMicron Technology is dirt-cheap compared to Palantir.\nNvidia is growing at roughly the same rate as Palantir but offers a more attractive risk-reward proposition.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nFew stocks received more buzz in 2025 than Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) . Such attention is to be expected when a stock soars nearly 140% after skyrocketing 340% in the previous year.\n\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp wrote to shareholders in November, \"This remains the beginning, the first moment of a first chapter.\" If he's right, Palantir is undoubtedly one of the best artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy as the new year begins. However, I think there are three AI stocks to buy in 2026 that could be better picks than Palantir.\n1. Alphabet Palantir focuses on one area of AI – software. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) covers nearly every base. I view that as a major advantage in 2026 and beyond.\nAlphabet's Google Cloud is the fastest-growing of the \"big three\" cloud service providers. It's a top choice for AI start-ups, with nearly all of the AI \" unicorns \" (start-ups that have a market cap of $1 billion or more) using Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Gemini 3.0 Pro ranks as the top large language model (LLM) currently available, according to LMArena's Leaderboard. Gemini 3.0 Flash is No. 2. Google has also integrated Gemini into its search engine, Workspace productivity suite, Chrome browser, Antigravity platform for developing AI agents, and other applications.\nThe company is making waves in the AI chip market as well. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). For example, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) used TPUs to train the generative AI models for its Apple Intelligence functionality. AI leader Anthropic keeps its costs lower by using TPUs rather than GPUs. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is reportedly in discussions with Google regarding the use of TPUs in its data centers.\n2. Micron Technology Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is a member of what some refer to as the \"memory oligarchy.\" Only three companies in the world supply high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Micron is one of them – and it's the only HBM manufacturer that's based in the U.S.\nPalantir's AI software wouldn't be able to run without powerful chips. Those chips wouldn't be able to function without high-bandwidth, low-latency memory. You could make a pretty good case that Micron, therefore, is more important to the AI space than Palantir.\n\nStory Continues\nI don't think we have to use that argument to view Micron as the better pick for 2026, though. Instead, we only need to consider the valuations of the two stocks.\nPalantir's forward price-to-earnings multiple is 181.8. Micron's forward earnings multiple is 9.2. Granted, Palantir's earnings are growing at a much faster rate. However, Micron's stock is more attractively valued, even when factoring in five-year earnings growth projections. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.5 compared to Palantir's PEG ratio of 2.8.\n\n3. Nvidia Then there's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . The company reigns as the king of AI. Its GPUs remain the most popular (and most powerful) chips for AI processing.\nNvidia might be the best stock to go head-to-head with Palantir. The two companies' recent growth rates are almost identical. Palantir reported that its revenue soared 63% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2025. Nvidia's revenue grew by 62% year-over-year.\n\nHowever, Nvidia appears to have an even greater wind at its back than Palantir. The GPU maker's quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in Q3 was 22%, compared to 18% for Palantir. Also, Nvidia's guidance projects revenue will increase by 14% quarter-over-quarter in Q4. Palantir expects revenue will increase by 12.5% in Q4.\nYou might guess that Nvidia's and Palantir's valuations would be similar based on their growth rates. Nope. Nvidia is cheaper using pretty much any valuation metric chosen. Perhaps Palantir will deliver higher gains in 2026, but I think Nvidia offers the better risk-reward proposition.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Should You Buy Ford While It's Below $15?\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 3:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: F\n\n^GSPC\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Ford can’t escape the cyclical nature of auto sales, with macro forces having a huge impact on revenue and profit trends.\nThe stock’s trailing-10-year total return comes up well short of the S&P 500.\nInvestors might be drawn to the cheap valuation and high dividend yield.\n10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company ›\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE: F) has just wrapped up an impressive year. In 2025, the maker of the very popular F-Series trucks saw its shares rise 33%. Even Tesla can't compete with this type of gain.\nMarket sentiment improved dramatically for the Detroit automaker. It's hard for investors to have any complaints.\nShould you buy this automotive stock while it's trading below $15 per share (a level last achieved in summer 2023)? For long-term investors who want to beat the market, the answer is clear as day.\nFord's market-thumping performance might be a one-off occurrence One of the most impactful ways that investors can upgrade their portfolios is by focusing exclusively on the highest-quality stocks. Since these come from the most outstanding businesses, it's not too difficult to identify them.\nCertain traits tend to stand out. For example, companies that collect recurring revenue are desirable because they sell products or services that drive repeat purchases, which adds stability and predictability.\n\nUnfortunately, Ford doesn't fit the bill here. Cars are huge purchases that households make infrequently, and they're cyclical. In recessionary periods , you can be sure that many consumers will delay buying a new vehicle to save money. Factors like interest rates, unemployment, inflation, and gas prices can all have a big impact.\nThe automaker's operations include huge expenses and capital expenditures, whether that's for its labor force, supplies and materials, factories, warranties, or research and development. Cutting back in any of these areas is risky since the company won't keep up with competitors, which all possess deep resources. Consequently, Ford typically posts discouraging profits, and its quarterly operating margin has averaged just 2.5% in the past five years.\n\nThe company has also proved that it struggles to accurately forecast the direction and pace of industry change. It recently announced a sizable $19.5 billion in special charges related to the restructuring of its overall business, with electric vehicle (EV) operations also being pared back.\nThis is a costly mistake that shareholders should not overlook. To be fair, even EV market experts overestimated how quickly the auto industry would make the sustainable transition. This points to the lack of significant growth opportunities in the auto sector, which naturally limits the potential for revenue and profit gains.\n\nStory Continues\nThese adverse attributes help explain why the automaker's shares have underperformed the market drastically in the past 10 years. The auto stock has produced a total return of 61%, well below the S&P 500 's 297%.\nNo catalysts are on the horizon that would make investors believe the next 10 years will be any different. Ford will likely continue having a subpar track record when it comes to compounding shareholder capital.\n\nBargain hunters and dividend investors Ford might be of interest to value investors who seek to buy businesses when they're trading at attractive valuations. Ford stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.3. Compared to the 22.3 multiple of the S&P 500, this is a big discount.\nFord will probably never be deserving of a valuation ratio that's in line with the broader index. That's because of those previously mentioned characteristics. The market is aware that this is a subpar business.\n\nThe stock pays a dividend yield of 4.54%, with the quarterly payout being $0.15. This might be compelling for income investors. When it comes to the dividend, however, even that isn't totally safe.\nIn an economic downturn, demand for Ford vehicles will be under pressure, which can hurt sales, which would also hurt profits. And management could pause the dividend to conserve cash.\nFord's dividend might not increase, and it's been temporarily halted in the past.

      "Content": "My 3 Favorite Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 2:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Palantir Technologies has a diverse and growing group of clients.\nSoundHound AI is not yet profitable, but it's scaling quickly.\nTesla is technically an electric vehicle company, but that doesn't begin to scratch the surface.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the most significant advance in our society since the smartphone essentially put the internet in everyone's pocket, giving rise to the app economy, mobile payments, on-demand videos and music, and mobile commerce. Smartphones have changed the world -- and completely altered both the stock market and the companies whose stocks are traded daily.\n\nAI is bringing a similar sort of disruptive change as computers become increasingly powerful, incorporating machine learning, large language models, and deep reasoning. AI is changing how we work, think, and entertain ourselves. Companies are working overtime to launch new AI features that help them operate more efficiently, as well as to captivate users with innovative services and products.\nThere are a lot of different ways to invest in AI -- you can buy stock in companies that are using AI inside their own operations (enterprise AI), those that make consumer-facing products (applied AI), or those that are taking big swings at making entire full-stack products.\nHere are three AI plays, each name representing one of those three themes.\nThe enterprise AI pick: Palantir Technologies Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is taking AI and running with it. The company operates powerful platforms that provide government agencies and commercial clients with insights that help them run better. It took off in April 2023 when it launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). The platform is integrated into Palantir's vaunted Foundry and Gotham software, allowing users to build workflows, perform actions, and get real-time data.\n\nPalantir is now securing new work at a rapid pace and with a diverse range of clients. It recently announced a deal with sports and entertainment company TWG Global to incorporate AI into the sport of rodeo to improve athlete performance and create new fan experiences. It also signed a deal with the U.S. Navy to help improve shipbuilding and manage its supply chain and with France's domestic intelligence agency to improve that nation's national security.\nThat's why Palantir's stock is up more than 960% since Jan. 1, 2024 -- and there appears to be much more runway ahead.\nThe applied AI pick: SoundHound AI SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) works at the intersection of artificial intelligence and voice recognition. Its AI platform is designed to allow users to have conversations with voice-enabled services and apps. It also has an app that recognizes music, whether it's being played by a live band, broadcast over the radio, or hummed by the user.\n\nStory Continues\nSoundHound has a lot of customers, including White Castle, which uses SoundHound in its drive-thru kiosks; Square, which incorporates SoundHound's platform in its point-of-sale systems; Motorola Solutions , which uses SoundHound to power its Hello Moto voice assistant; and Snap , which uses SoundHound to add voice AI to Snapchat's voice scan camera search feature.\n\nSoundHound isn't profitable, but it's scaling up. Revenue in the third quarter was $42.05 million, up 68% from the year-ago quarter, and the company has $269 million in cash or cash equivalents with no debt. The stock is up 141% in 2025.\nThe big-swing AI pick: Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is on the surface an electric vehicle company, but the work that it's doing with AI goes far beyond automobiles. CEO Elon Musk has Tesla investing heavily in its AI platform, which runs its self-driving software and trains its networks to recognize things from road layouts to driving conditions and predict the paths of other vehicles. Tesla has now made its Robotaxi app available throughout the U.S. and Canada, and the company seems to be on track to eventually rolling it out so Tesla users can monetize their vehicles by making them available as autonomous taxis.\n\nBut that's just scratching the surface. Tesla is also working on Optimus, its general-purpose humanoid robot. Optimus is a long way from reality, but Musk is highly incentivized to make it happen, considering that his new $1 trillion incentive plan includes a goal that Tesla successfully build and deploy 1 million Optimus robots.\nTesla stock is up only 14% in 2025. But it could be on the verge of a huge gain, making this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock a compelling name to watch in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?

      "Content": "A Once-in-a-Decade Investment Opportunity: The 3 Best AI Stocks to Buy in January 2026\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMETA\n\nPSTG\n\nJPM\n\nKey Points Nvidia's graphics processing units are the industry standard in artificial intelligence infrastructure, but the company is truly formidable due to its full-stack strategy.\nMeta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve engagement and advertising conversion rates across its portfolio of industry-leading social media properties.\nPure Storage is a leader in enterprise storage solutions, and its all-flash arrays pack more storage density and greater power efficiency than any competing product.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) promises to be the most transformative technology of the decade, if not all of human history. Analysts have compared the AI revolution to other major inflection points, including the advent of the internet, the introduction of the smartphone, and the invention of the microprocessor.\nHowever, AI is being adopted much more quickly than all of those technologies. Indeed, Stephanie Aliaga at JPMorgan Chase writes, \"In the first half of 2025, AI-related capital expenditures contributed 1.1% to GDP growth, outpacing the U.S. consumer as an engine of expansion.\"\nHere's why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , and Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG) are my picks for the three best AI stocks to buy in January 2026.\nNvidia: 32% upside implied by the median target price Nvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that speed up compute-intensive data center workloads like analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). But the company is truly formidable because it complements its GPUs with CPUs, networking platforms, and an unparalleled ecosystem of software tools that assist developers with building applications.\n\nConsequently, while custom AI accelerators developed by competitors like Broadcom are generally cheaper, Nvidia systems frequently have a lower total cost of ownership because the company can optimize performance across most facets of the data center computing stack. Additionally, custom chips lack pre-built software tools, which means they must be built from scratch.\nMorningstar analyst Brian Colello says Nvidia's vertically integrated business model that spans data center hardware and software affords the company a wide economic moat. \"In the long run, we expect tech titans to strive to find second sources or in-house solutions to diversify away from Nvidia in AI, but these efforts will, at best, only chip away at Nvidia's AI dominance.\"\n\nNvidia's adjusted earnings increased 60% in the third quarter, and Wall Street estimates earnings will increase at 67% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 46 times earnings look cheap. Indeed, among 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share, implying 32% upside from its current share price of $189.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms: 29% upside implied by the median target price Meta Platforms is the second-largest ad tech company in the world. The company has an almost unparalleled ability to source consumer data because it owns four of the six most popular social media properties as measured by monthly active users. That data continuously informs content ranking and ad targeting systems to improve the user experience.\n\nMeta has developed several artificial intelligence products, from custom AI chips that reduce dependence on Nvidia GPUs to proprietary machine learning models that optimize the performance of ad impressions. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says \"higher quality and more relevant content\" has led to deeper engagement across Facebook and Instagram.\nMeta's earnings increased 20% in the third quarter (excluding a one-time tax charge) and Wall Street estimates adjusted earnings will increase 21% in 2026. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings a fair price for patient investors. Among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $840 per share, implying 29% upside from its current share price of $650.\nPure Storage: 45% upside implied by the median target price Pure Storage builds all-flash storage systems and adjacent software that lets enterprises manage file, block, and object storage across private and public clouds. The company has distinguished itself with DirectFlash technology, which eliminates many inefficiencies and bottlenecks associated with traditional solid-state drives by managing raw flash memory at the array level rather than the device level.\n\n\"Our DirectFlash modules deliver two to three times the storage density and consume from 39% to 54% fewer watts per terabyte than our closest competitors today,\" according to the company. Consultancy Gartner recently recognized Pure Storage as the technology leader in enterprise storage platforms, listing automation features, data management capabilities, and strong customer satisfaction as key strengths.\nThe all-flash array market is forecast to grow at 16% annually through 2033 as the AI boom continues. Pure Storage's adjusted earnings increased 16% during the third quarter, but Wall Street anticipates an acceleration to 23% annually through the fiscal year ending in February 2027. That makes the current valuation of 39 times earnings look reasonable.\n\nIndeed, among 23 Wall Street analysts, Pure Storage has a median target price of $100 per share. That implies 45% upside from its current share price of $69.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "The 5 Hottest Robinhood Stocks to Kick Off 2026\n\nBram Berkowitz, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 9:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: HOOD\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Retail investors now exert real influence on the stock market.\nAll investors should understand what stocks this cohort likes.\nThe most popular stocks on Robinhood are largely in the tech and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nThe popular online brokerage Robinhood has given rise to a whole new generation of retail investors who are active and invested in the market, and this group has significantly more influence than it did a decade ago. Now, retail can influence stocks, which is why all investors need to keep tabs on where the retail winds are blowing.\nRobinhood regularly provides data on the most-owned stocks on its platform. Here are the five hottest stocks on Robinhood as we kick off 2026.\n1. Tesla The electric vehicle (EV) and robotaxi company Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has long been a favorite among retail investors since it went public in 2010. Not only has Tesla made many investors rich along the way, but the market has been captivated by the company's controversial CEO, Elon Musk, who has given the company a cultlike following.\n\nWhile Tesla struggled at times in 2025 due to challenges in its core EV business, the market has shifted its focus to the company's full self-driving technology, emerging robotaxi fleet, and eventual Optimus humanoid robots.\nSome Wall Street analysts view it as one of the most innovative artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the market, while others find it woefully overvalued. I share concerns regarding the high multiples the stock trades at, but I don't see it losing favor with the retail crowd anytime soon.\n2. Nvidia Not surprisingly, retail investors have poured into the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in recent years and have also been greatly rewarded. Nvidia is the ultimate pick-and-shovel play in the AI sector, which many believe will transform society as we know it. The company has also dominated the chip sector and delivered staggering gross margins, at one point in the mid-70s percentage range.\n\nNvidia could see both tailwinds and headwinds in 2026. On the one hand, investors are concerned that competitors may start to erode Nvidia's market share and cut into its margins. There are also concerns about how the company accounts for depreciation and all the investments Nvidia is making in its vendors and customers, which the bears believe is creating a circular revenue cycle that may not be sustainable.\nOn the other hand, Nvidia is still seeing strong demand and could get its business in China back up and running, which is a significant market and would drive revenue materially higher.\n\nStory Continues\n3. Apple Iconic consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is part of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" but was dogged last year by tariffs, as most of its iPhones are manufactured abroad. Investors have also been disappointed in Apple's lack of an AI strategy. However, later in 2025, this turned into a strength of sorts, as investors became concerned that other Magnificent Seven members were spending recklessly on AI capital expenditures (capex).\n\nThis creates several paths to a better year in 2026. Tech investors may view the stock as a safer bet among the Magnificent Seven names, especially if concerns about capex linger. Alternatively, Apple could develop a strong AI strategy at some point this year that excites investors.\nDown 12% over the past year (as of Dec. 29), Apple's stock has trailed the broader market, but the company clearly still has a great business that at some point is likely to benefit from AI.\n4. Amazon Another Magnificent Seven stock lagging the broader market, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has also been hit hard by tariffs, as a significant portion of third-party sellers and products sold on Amazon's massive e-commerce marketplace are manufactured or based in China or abroad. However, this may be one of the tech giants investors should consider.\n\nAmazon has built one of the largest, strongest logistics networks in the world, allowing consumers to buy almost anything and have it delivered to their door within a few days. This is unlikely to be replicated anytime soon. Furthermore, Amazon is also one of the largest cloud players with Amazon Web Services.\nThis business will benefit as more people simply move their businesses to the cloud. It will also benefit as more businesses deploy AI solutions because AWS is well-positioned to assist businesses in running large language models (LLMs).\n5. Ford Motor Company Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is one of the few companies among Robinhood's most-owned stocks that is not an AI play. The stock has performed well this year, due to a strategic pivot regarding its electric vehicle business. Instead of trying to mass-produce EVs, an endeavor that has resulted in high costs, Ford now plans to focus on hybrids and internal combustion vehicles with a clear path to profitability.\n\nFord will have to take a $19.5 billion charge as a result of the move, but investors were relieved to see this. The EV market faces challenges, particularly with the Trump administration having eliminated a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs. EV policies under the current administration are unlikely to improve.\nFurthermore, Ford recently raised its 2025 guidance for adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and reaffirmed its adjusted free cash flow guidance. The company also has a very attractive, roughly 4.5% trailing-12-month dividend yield.\nWe just issued 'double down' alerts on 3 stocks — find out if Tesla made our list Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "SpaceX, Private Ventures Fuel Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Dreams\n\nJennifer Ablan\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 9:01 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nElon Musk, often described as a modern-day Thomas Edison , may soon add an unprecedented title to his résumé: the world’s first trillionaire. Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined his public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth.\nThe buzz around a potential IPO valued at as much as $1.5 trillion for the high-flying government contractor has emerged as the primary swing factor in the entrepreneur’s net worth at the same time that Tesla shareholders have approved a massive, performance-based compensation package that could significantly expand his stake in the electric-car maker. Together, these developments have shifted Musk’s path to extreme wealth from incremental gains to a handful of high-stakes corporate milestones.\n\nMusk’s net worth has surged nearly 50% year over year to an estimated $645 billion . In October, he became the first individual to surpass a $500 billion net worth, propelled by rising private-market valuations for SpaceX and renewed confidence in Tesla’s long-term strategy. If Musk meets the aggressive performance targets tied to his Tesla compensation plan, and if SpaceX continues on its current trajectory, he could break the trillion-dollar barrier.\nSuch an accomplishment would test the upper bounds of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, created and named when the idea of a trillionaire still seemed unfathomable and absurd. Now, it no longer does. Already, Musk has been cast front and center, most recently by Forbes , as the maestro of this era’s wealth creation.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: Receive more of our free The Daily Upside newsletter. READ ALSO: Vice Stocks Enter ’26 With a Harsh Hangover and Prediction Markets Fuel Gambling Gold Rush\nTo the Moon with SpaceX! SpaceX, which has invested aggressively in reusable rockets, launch infrastructure, and satellites, is the single largest lever in the trillionaire equation. Musk owns an estimated 42% of the private rocket and satellite company, which recent secondary share transactions have valued at $350 billion to $800 billion in private markets ; that makes his stake worth roughly $136 billion to more than $300 billion on paper today. The real upside comes from long-term growth and the potential for a public offering; if SpaceX lists at valuations some analysts forecast (up to about $1.5 trillion), Musk’s stake alone could exceed $600 billion, reshaping his net worth significantly.\n\nIndeed, Starlink has rapidly become the financial backbone of SpaceX. The satellite internet service has added 1 million new customers in under seven weeks, bringing its total to more than 9 million active users across 155 countries and territories , according to the company, implying a growth rate of more than 20,000 new users per day since early November.\n\nStory Continues\nThat momentum caps an explosive year. In December 2024, SpaceX reported 4.6 million Starlink customers; by August 2025, the figure had climbed to 7 million, before accelerating sharply in recent months. The service now operates on a constellation of more than 9,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites, enabling broadband connectivity in rural, maritime, aviation, and defense-critical regions beyond the reach of traditional networks (For my part, I can now use Wi-Fi on routes to and from New York and Hawaii, even over the Pacific Ocean — something that was previously impossible — because of Starlink.)\n\nMusk has said Starlink is now “by far” the largest driver of SpaceX’s revenue — a distinction that has materially altered how investors assess the company.\nTesla Times Two While SpaceX and Starlink represent the transformational upside, Tesla remains a critical component of Musk’s wealth trajectory. His 2018 compensation package, revived after the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that had voided it, entitles Musk to acquire stock options tied to ambitious operational and market-capitalization milestones. Most of those milestones have already been achieved, giving Musk the right to purchase roughly 304 million Tesla shares at deeply discounted prices, currently valued at approximately $139 billion.\n\nAdding to this, Tesla’s shareholders have also approved a new performance-based pay plan , further increasing Musk’s potential upside and consolidating his control over the company. If fully realized, these packages could add hundreds of billions in theoretical value, though the actual gain depends on hitting aggressive targets and on public-market conditions.\nAll told, the new performance plan positions Musk to unlock value as Tesla begins monetizing AI-driven initiatives, including full self-driving, autonomous fleet operations and robotics .\nIn this framework, Tesla serves as an accelerant rather than the primary driver of Musk’s net worth. Its gains are meaningful but incremental, constrained by stock performance, earnings multiples and investor sentiment. SpaceX, by contrast, offers the potential for sudden, transformative gains: an IPO, Starlink expansion or secondary-market repricing could add hundreds of billions almost overnight.\n\n“Heading into 2026, this marks a monster year for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins,” analyst Dan Ives writes in his latest report on Top 5 Names to Play the AI Revolution into 2026. “The AI valuation will start to get unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next six to nine months has now begun, with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose for Musk & Co. We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year, and in a bull-case scenario, $3 trillion by the end of 2026.”\nOther Ventures: Diversifying Upside Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk holds stakes in several ventures that extend both financial upside and strategic influence, positioning him across AI, social platforms, neurotechnology and infrastructure:\nxAI: Founded in 2023, xAI is Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, where he retains a majority stake. The company is focused on developing cutting-edge AI models and applications that complement Musk’s broader ecosystem, including social media platform X. Recent valuations range widely from $80 billion to 230 billion , reflecting both the early-stage nature of the business and high investor interest. xAI represents a strategic play to position Musk alongside leading AI players like OpenAI, while creating new revenue streams through AI-enabled products and services. Its integration with X also allows Musk to leverage social data to accelerate AI training and deployment.\nX (formerly Twitter): After purchasing Twitter for $44 billion, Musk rebranded it as X and reoriented it for AI-driven engagement, monetization and information distribution. While it was valued at $33 billion when taken over by xAI, its strategic significance extends beyond its valuation. X now hosts Grok, xAI’s generative AI assistant, which leverages real-time social data from the platform to provide conversational responses, insights on trending events, and even image generation. This integration allows X to function as a distribution layer for xAI, a live data source for AI model training and a testbed for monetization strategies that could scale across advertising, subscription and autonomous content moderation technologies.\nNeuralink: Musk’s neurotechnology venture developing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to integrate human cognition with AI systems. Musk maintains a controlling stake, with valuations in the $5 billion to $9 billion range. If the technology reaches commercial viability, it could revolutionize healthcare, human-computer interaction and cognitive augmentation, providing an outsized strategic and financial payoff.\nThe Boring Company: This tunneling and infrastructure venture is valued at roughly $5 billion to $7 billion . While smaller than Musk’s other holdings, The Boring Company exemplifies his approach to disruptive infrastructure solutions, including urban transit tunnels, hyperloop development and city-scale transportation projects.\nIn true “Musk fashion,” the venture was inspired when Musk was stuck in LA traffic .\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

      "Content": "Perplexity CEO Says On-Device AI Threatens Data Centers As Industry Faces '$10 Trillion Question' — Apple, Qualcomm Positioned To Benefit\n\nMohd Haider\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 7:30 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nQCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nPEAI.PVT\n\nHPQ\n\nAravind Srinivas , CEO of Perplexity AI , which is backed by Jeff Bezos and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), issued a contrarian warning about the future of artificial intelligence, saying on-device intelligence running on personal devices could disrupt the centralized data center model driving massive infrastructure investments.\n\nLocalized AI Could Upend Data Center Industry “The biggest threat to a data center is if the intelligence can be packed locally on a chip that’s running on the device and then there’s no need to inference all of it on like one centralized data center,” Srinivas said in a podcast interview with Prakhar Gupta released last week.\nSrinivas, who has previously worked at OpenAI , Google Brain , and DeepMind , said that AI running directly on personal devices could reduce the need for centralized data centers .\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nMissed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n“That really disrupts the whole data center industry like it doesn’t make sense to spend all this money $500 billion, $5 trillion whatever on building all the centralized data centers across the world,” he said, calling it a “$10 trillion question, hundred trillion dollar question.”\nHe also highlighted scenarios where AI running locally could learn from repeated tasks on individual devices, adapting over time and automating user activities.\n“It adapts to you and over time starts automating a lot of the things you do. That way you don’t have to repeat it. That’s your intelligence. You own it. It’s your brain,” Srinivas said.\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nChip Companies and OEMs Positioned to Benefit Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has “a massive advantage” due to its M1 chips and power-efficient devices, according to Srinivas. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and original equipment manufacturers, including Apple, Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ), Lenovo (OTC: LNVGF ), and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ ) could also benefit from distributing AI-enabled devices.\n\nHowever, technical barriers remain. Srinivas noted that no AI model has yet been released that can run efficiently on a local chip while completing tasks reliably.\nThe Indian-born entrepreneur expects early adoption on MacBooks or iPads before reaching smartphones.\nImplications For Robotics And Labor He also discussed the potential for AI in the physical world, especially in robotics. Srinivas said AI could transform the labor market by automating many tasks now done by humans, echoing concerns raised by Geoffrey Hinton who is often called the ‘Godfather of AI’.\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nIndustry Risks The U.S. economy is becoming increasingly reliant on AI, raising concerns about a potential AI bubble. If such a bubble bursts, centralized data centers could become a “ single point of failure ,” with widespread economic repercussions.\nSrinivas’s caution highlights a crucial question for the AI and tech industries: will centralized data centers continue to be the foundation of the digital economy as AI becomes more dispersed, or will intelligence on personal devices radically transform the sector?\n\nRead Next: Missed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs?

      "Content": "The Market May Be Underestimating This AI Trend, and These Stocks Are Set to Benefit\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 4:55 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nCOHR\n\nKey Points Broadcom is proving to be a key beneficiary in the AI networking market, with around $20 billion of non-accelerator AI backlog.\nCoherent is also benefiting from the ongoing AI networking upgrade cycle.\nAs AI clusters scale beyond 100,000 compute nodes, demand for high-speed, high-bandwidth, low-latency, reliable networking has soared dramatically.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\n\nThe rapid expansion of global artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure is increasingly constrained not by raw compute but by bandwidth, latency, and reliability of the networking interconnects. Hyperscalers are deploying AI clusters with over 100,000 compute nodes (GPUs, accelerators, CPUs) to support large-scale training and inferencing workloads. These clusters require tens of thousands of optical modules to move data efficiently between GPUs, switches, and racks.\nWith copper-based networking unable to keep pace, hyperscalers are adopting 800-gigabit (800G) optical modules at scale, while 1.6-terabit (1.6T) silicon photonics-based interconnects are already in the advanced qualification and early customer adoption stages.\nDespite the scale of this AI networking opportunity, investors have remained disproportionately focused on the GPUs. Here are two companies that can benefit from this underestimated AI trend in 2026.\n\nBroadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is increasingly seeing strong demand for its AI networking components, as hyperscalers build data center infrastructure ahead of deploying custom accelerators.\nBroadcom exited its fiscal 2025 with AI switch backlog exceeding $10 billion, driven by record bookings for its 102-terabit-per-second Tomahawk 6 switch. The company has also secured record orders for digital signal processors and optical networking components, such as lasers and PCI Express switches. The company reported $73 billion total AI-related backlog to be delivered in the next 18 months, almost half of the $162 billion consolidated backlog. Since nearly $20 billion of the $73 billion backlog is nonaccelerator content, it is evident that networking and optical components are already becoming a material revenue source.\n\nAt the same time, Broadcom's custom accelerator business is still its primary growth engine. The company's AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year over year in the quarter to $6.5 billion. Management expects AI revenue to double year over year to $8.2 billion in the current quarter.\nConsidering its strong accelerator and networking portfolio, Broadcom is well positioned to capture a significant share of global AI infrastructure buildout.\n\nStory Continues\nCoherent Coherent (NYSE: COHR) designs and sells lasers, optical transceivers, and photonic components that enable high-speed, high-bandwidth, and low-latency data transmission in AI data centers, cloud networks, and telecommunication infrastructure.\nCoherent is already seeing clear AI-driven traction and is well positioned to benefit from the AI networking upgrade cycle. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending Sept. 30, 2025), revenue was up 17% year over year to $1.58 billion. Data center revenue was up 23% year over year, driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for its high-speed optical connectivity equipment. Coherent experienced record bookings in the first quarter, with some orders extending more than 12 months into the future. This highlights the company's robust revenue visibility, which can help protect it from near-term macro volatility.\n\nThe company has also demonstrated the capabilities of the 1.6T optical transceivers based on three different technologies: silicon photonics, electro-absorption modulated laser (EML), and vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). While early ramp-ups are underway, the company expects broader adoption as customers scale their AI networks in calendar year 2026.\nWith accelerating 800G deployments, early 1.6T ramps, and expanding bookings backlog, Coherent could see rapid growth in the coming years.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Just Made a Major Move for 2026. Time to Buy?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 1:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia has delivered record earnings in recent years as demand for its AI chips skyrocketed.\nBut recent exclusion from one major market has kept the tech giant from reaching its full potential.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) delivered top-notch performance over the past two years, with the stock climbing more than 200% over that time period. This is thanks to the company's position in the artificial intelligence (AI) market, one that's on the road to reach into the trillions of dollars in just a few years. Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and related products and services has helped the company's earnings soar to records.\n\nBut one problem weighed on Nvidia throughout most of 2025, and that was sales of chips to China. The U.S. had tightened export controls on chips to that country, and as a result, Nvidia reported a billion-dollar charge earlier in the year for chips that it couldn't sell. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang says China's AI chip market could represent hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the decade, so this clearly is a market that chip companies want to access.\nA few weeks ago, President Donald Trump gave Nvidia the OK for sales of its H200 chip to China -- and just recently, Nvidia made a related move that could be big for 2026. Let's check it out and determine if now is a good moment to get in on the stock.\nExport controls on AI chips So, first, a bit more background on the Nvidia-China situation. The U.S. initially placed controls on exports to that country and certain others for security reasons back in 2022. In response to that, Nvidia designed the H20 chip to specifically meet guidelines and was able to sell that product in China. In the fiscal 2025 full year, sales to China represented 13% of Nvidia's overall revenue .\n\nBut last year, as mentioned, the U.S. halted sales of even the H20, leaving Nvidia and other U.S. chip designers excluded from the Chinese market.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia continued to deliver solid growth, suggesting that even without sales to China, the company could score an AI win for investors. In the latest quarter, for example, Nvidia's revenue soared 62% to $57 billion amid solid demand for its Blackwell platform. And Nvidia continued to generate strong profitability on sales, maintaining gross margin above 70%. Still, the picture likely would have been even brighter if Nvidia had been able to serve customers in China.\nTrump's big announcement Several weeks ago, Trump announced that Nvidia may return to the China market -- this time with the H200, which is more powerful than the H20 but less powerful than Nvidia's Blackwell chips. As part of the deal, Nvidia must offer 25% of its China chip sales to the U.S.\n\nStory Continues\nNow, let's consider the move that Nvidia reportedly made recently. Nvidia said it aims to begin shipping H200 chips to China, using existing stock, by the middle of next month, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Nvidia also has asked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , the producer of its chips, to increase production amid orders for two million H200s for 2026, according to the wire service.\n\nThis is fantastic news, but some elements of risk remain. China hasn't yet officially approved the entrance of H200s into the country -- any delay or setback there could be problematic, especially if Nvidia starts ramping up production. Nvidia also faces the complex task of continuing strong production to meet demand for its newer Blackwell platform in the U.S. and other parts of the world, and at the same time producing enough H200s for Chinese customers.\nReason to be optimistic Still, when Trump announced the loosening of export controls, he also said that China's response was positive -- so there's reason to be optimistic about Nvidia's return to that market. As for production, Nvidia has a track record of successful product launches while managing the manufacturing of earlier systems, too. And it's unlikely Nvidia would make a significant move to ramp up H200 production without confidence that its orders could be shipped.\n\nSo, does this potential business in China make Nvidia a buy today? I wouldn't buy Nvidia uniquely for this reason, but renewed sales in China clearly would be a great step forward in 2026. The reason I would buy the stock is the company's overall potential in the global AI market. Nvidia is the AI chip leader, and this is likely to continue due to its focus on innovation and its financial strength. Finally, demand from AI customers remains strong.\nThese three elements make Nvidia a fantastic buy -- and a potential return to the China market in 2026 is icing on the cake.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Loaded Up on Nike Stock. Should You?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 12:38 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tim Cook bought 50,000 shares of Nike stock.\nThe Apple CEO is a director on Nike's board.\nNike recently returned to top-line growth, but there are still some major concerns.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nWhen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE) in late December, it got a lot of attention and even sent shares of the athletic apparel and shoe company sharply higher. After all, not only is Cook a successful businessman, but he is a Nike insider. The CEO sits on Nike's board of directors.\nInvestors sometimes treat insider buying as a simple signal: management (or board members) think the stock is undervalued. Sometimes that's right. But investors shouldn't follow blindly.\nSo, is Nike stock a good buy today or not? Let's take a look.\nCook's buy matters, but so does the context Notably, Cook's purchase was an open market one. This means it wasn't part of a stock option compensation plan (or a similar plan). Rather, he had to pay full price for his shares. Additionally, the purchase was sizable, totaling nearly $3 million. It also nearly doubled his stake in the company. Given the size of the purchase and the significant increase in Cook's stake, it's not surprising that the market interpreted the purchase as good news.\n\nStill, it's important to remember that Cook is a Nike director.\nThat doesn't mean the purchase is meaningless. But it does mean he may have incentives beyond pure return maximization. Directors often want to demonstrate alignment with shareholders, reinforce confidence during a rough stretch, or meet (or stay ahead of) internal ownership expectations. In other words, it can be both a sincere vote of confidence and a governance-minded move.\nA rough patch Investors should look beyond Cook's purchase to answer this simple question: Does Nike's business momentum (or lack of it) and valuation offer an attractive risk-reward right now?\nUnfortunately, I don't think so.\nNike's turnaround is making progress, but the business still looks challenged.\n\nRevenue in the company's second quarter of fiscal 2026 (a period ended on Nov. 30, 2025), rose just 1% year over year. Further, the composition of this revenue was probably even more discouraging than this anemic headline figure. Yes, wholesale revenue rose 8% year over year, but its higher-margin Nike Direct revenue fell 8%. Nike Direct is the company's direct-to-consumer channel, made up of Nike-owned stores and sales through its digital platforms. So, this channel speaks to the company's brand power with consumers, given how directly these channels are tied to its business and to consumers.\n\nStory Continues\nNike's profitability also moved in the wrong direction. Gross margin fell 300 basis points to 40.6%, and net income declined 32% to $792 million.\nSome of Nike's near-term problems are self-inflicted as it tries to reposition parts of its business and sharpen its product and brand message so that it can perform better over the long term. But Nike still has a lot of work to do.\n\n\"NIKE is in the middle innings of our comeback,\" said Nike CEO Elliott Hill in the company's latest earnings release, adding that the company is working through its \"Win Now\" strategic actions, including \"strengthening partner relationships\" and \"rebalancing our portfolio...\"\nMeanwhile, the athleisure space remains intensely competitive , as the company faces major competition from younger brands like Lululemon , Vuori, and Hoka, as well as more established brands like Adidas . Of course, Nike's brand still has enormous global equity. But consumers have more choices than ever.\nA look at valuation I'd be more willing to recommend Nike in the middle of its turnaround and an intensely competitive environment, but shares arguably don't look cheap enough. Sure, the company's dividend yield of 2.6% is solid, and Nike has an exceptional balance sheet. But with earnings moving in the wrong direction and sales barely growing, it's tough to justify the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 37.\n\nEven Nike's forward price-to-earnings is high, at 40. Measuring its price as a multiple of analysts' expected earnings per share over the next year, the fact that Nike's forward price-to-earnings ratio is higher than its trailing price-to-earnings ratio shows that analysts expect earnings to remain under pressure.\nGiven the competitive intensity in athleisure, declining sales in its direct-to-consumer channel, margin pressure, and ongoing uncertainty as far as tariffs go, I personally will be staying on the sidelines.\nCook's buy in Nike stock is interesting. But, for me, that's about all it is.\nShould you buy stock in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

One of the up-and-coming players is IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) , which makes a trapped-ion system that seeks to solve complex problems more efficiently. If the demand and applications for its technology live up to the hype, IonQ could potentially be the next Nvidia .\n\nIonQ's ability is promising IonQ is moving in the right direction and recently revised its full-year guidance upward to between $106 million and $110 million. In its latest quarter, the company reported a 222% year-over-year increase in revenue.\nIonQ also set a world record for 2-qubit gate performance in 2025, with fidelity exceeding 99.99%. IonQ is the only quantum computing company in the world to cross the \"four-nines\" benchmark. This is a landmark technical achievement, positioning IonQ well to capture a significant share of the future quantum computing market. It already touts an impressive who's who of customers and partners.\n\nIonQ could be a moonshot if the company can deliver on its technology roadmap. The plan is to deploy the world's most powerful quantum computers by 2030 with 2 million qubits. IonQ anticipates that this will have significant implications for drug discovery, materials science, financial modeling, cybersecurity, and defense.\nHow big is the quantum computing market? Skeptics will tell you that IonQ will crash land because quantum computing isn't as effective or applicable in real life as we'd hoped. Five years from now, we'll likely know if the skeptics were correct or off-base.\nIonQ's shareholders have experienced quite a roller-coaster ride over the past year, as the stock peaked at over $84 but has since returned to more reasonable levels. IonQ is still at a premium valuation, but that won't matter to long-term investors if the company can seize on the opportunity in the next five years. If you're a risk-tolerant investor who believes quantum computing is revolutionary, IonQ looks ready to capitalize.\n\nShould you buy stock in IonQ right now?

Which Is the Better Investment?\n\nKatie Brockman, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 10:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nXLK\n\nKey Points XLK is significantly cheaper to own and far larger than SOXX, but its recent returns have lagged the semiconductor-focused fund.\nSOXX is more volatile and suffered a deeper five-year drawdown, reflecting its narrow chip-sector tilt.\nXLK offers broader tech exposure, with mega-cap holdings like Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft dominating its portfolio.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nBoth the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) and the State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLK) aim to capture U.S. technology growth, but their approaches differ: SOXX zeroes in on the semiconductor segment , while XLK provides diversified exposure across the entire technology sector.\nFor investors comparing these two, the choice comes down to cost, risk profile, and the breadth of tech exposure each fund delivers.\nSnapshot (cost & size) Metric\nSOXX\nXLK\nIssuer\niShares\nSPDR\nExpense ratio\n0.34%\n0.08%\n1-yr return (as of Jan. 2, 2026)\n45.63%\n24.13%\nDividend yield\n0.55%\n0.53%\nAUM\n$17 billion\n$93 billion\nBeta (5Y monthly)\n1.77\n1.26\n\nBeta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500. The 1-yr return represents total return over the trailing 12 months.\nXLK offers a substantially lower expense ratio than SOXX, which could appeal to investors looking to minimize fees. Both funds offer similar dividend yields, so income-focused investors won't notice a meaningful difference between the two in this regard.\n\nPerformance & risk comparison Metric\nSOXX\nXLK\nGrowth of $1,000 over 5 years\n$2,483\n$2,220\nMax drawdown (5Y)\n-45.75%\n-33.56%\n\nOver the last five years, SOXX delivered stronger growth than XLK, but it also experienced a much deeper maximum drawdown -- reflecting its higher risk and narrower sector focus compared to XLK’s broader tech approach.\nWhat's inside XLK tracks the performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, offering exposure to 70 leading U.S. technology stocks across hardware, software, IT services, and semiconductors.\nIts top holdings -- Nvidia , Apple , and Microsoft -- collectively make up nearly 40% of assets, highlighting a mega-cap tilt. With 27 years of history and over $90 billion in assets under management (AUM), XLK is among the largest and most liquid sector ETFs available.\n\nSOXX, by contrast, is laser-focused on the semiconductor industry, holding just 30 companies. Its largest positions include Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , and Micron Technology .\nFor more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link .\nWhat this means for investors XLK and SOXX are both tech-centric funds, but they differ in their approaches and goals.\n\nStory Continues\nXLK is much broader, not only in its portfolio size (containing more than twice the number of stocks as SOXX), but in its diversification, too. It includes stocks from various corners of the technology sector, which can help mitigate its risk during periods of volatility.\nSOXX, on the other hand, is devoted entirely to semiconductor stocks. This targeted approach can be both an advantage and a risk. When semiconductor companies are thriving, this ETF can significantly outperform the market. But when this segment of the market stumbles, investors are likely to see much steeper downturns.\n\nCase in point: SOXX has earned much higher 12-month and five-year total returns compared to XLK, but it's also experienced a much more severe max drawdown in that time.

      "Content": "The Vanguard ETF That Warren Buffett's Comments Point to as a Top Pick Today\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 6:06 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nBRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nAXP\n\nBAC\n\nKey Points Warren Buffett typically invests in individual stocks, but he has given his stamp of approval to ETFs, including one in particular.\nBuffett's principles of simplicity, diversification, low cost, and a long-term focus align perfectly with this Vanguard ETF.\nFor most investors, Buffett suggests that buying and holding the S&P 500 is the best way to go.\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nRenowned investor Warren Buffett has for decades spoken about the benefits of long-term, low-cost, fundamentals-based investing. The largest positions in the portfolio of his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , American Express (NYSE: AXP) , and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) . All are quality companies with healthy balance sheets, lots of cash flow , and strong positions within their industries.\nSome investors looking to follow the Buffett style are willing to spend the time researching and studying individual stocks. But what about the people who simply want to invest without all of the work?\nBuffett has a suggestion for those folks, too.\nIn many cases, he thinks investors need to keep it simple, diversified, and cheap. The one place he's consistently said people should invest is the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) . That makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) a true Buffett-endorsed investment idea.\nWhy Warren Buffett likes the S&P 500 Not only has Buffett touted investing in the S&P 500 as the best long-term option for most investors, it's a strategy he advocates for his wife after his death.\nIn his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett wrote:\nWith this quote, Buffett emphasizes something that he's insinuated for years. High fees and emotional decision-making are the two biggest factors that can damage investor returns. Instead of trying to beat and/or time the market, simply buy and hold a diversified portfolio of the biggest and best U.S. companies and pay next to nothing for doing so.\n\nStory Continues\nHis endorsement of Vanguard and VOO -- which launched in 2010 -- aligns with that philosophy. The simple and cheap approach utilized by Vanguard tends to do the best job for the majority of people.\nBuffett isn't bothered by volatility At the 2025 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in September, Buffett said he wasn't terribly concerned about the market volatility that was occurring thanks to April 1st's \"Liberation Day\" that introduced the world to President Donald Trump's global tariff policy.\nEven as the S&P 500 was dropping more than 15% at the time, Buffett said:\nThis helped reaffirm Buffett's philosophy that he focuses on the long term and always looks for value. While a 50% loss would send most people into a panic, Buffett looks at it as an opportunity to pick up an asset at a sale price. Instead of giving into emotional decision-making, he looks to buy a good asset at the right price.\n\nThis isn't specifically an endorsement for investing in the S&P 500, but the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be the ETF to target if you're looking to invest with this same long-term mentality. Avoid the temptation to time the market and simply take advantage of long-term compounding by buying quality assets, such as U.S. large-cap stocks.\nThe big picture Warren Buffett has said in the past that investing in the S&P 500 is the best way to go for most inexperienced investors. He even called out the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF as the one he prefers.\nFor one of the most successful investors of all time who buys individual stocks, this is about as good a seal of approval for an ETF as you'll get.\n\nThe fundamental principles of simplicity, diversification, low cost, and long-term focus that come with investing in VOO align perfectly with the Warren Buffett vision.\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now? Before you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

For ACM Research ACMR, the revenue projection is a two-year CAGR, but the EPS growth projection is only for 2026. For Cohu COHU, there is no EPS projection because the company is expected to post a net loss for 2025.\n\nThere are several stocks on the list that are highly regarded by the analysts, but whose price targets are close to the current prices. This is because analysts working for brokerage and research firms nearly all set 12-month price targets, even though that might be considered to be a short period for long-term investors.\nThe question of demand sustainability usually comes up at the start of a new year given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Another concern is the dynamic of having an oligopoly of semicap suppliers for a small base of buyers, Mizuho desk-based analyst Jordan Klein told MarketWatch.\nLooking out into this year, however, Klein said it “is the first time in a long time that I can remember where the whole sustainability fear question is not as big a concern for investors.”\n\nThat points to strong demand trends, he said. While AI demand is a driver, Klein said more complex chip designs are also helping to create upward momentum in the growth rate among semicap companies — a trend he doesn’t see slowing anytime soon.\nBecause the lead times for semiconductor capital equipment are typically six to nine months, it is necessary to look out further and anticipate what order rates and demand trends will be toward the end of the year going into 2027, Klein said. Customers are ordering in advance because of the wait times, he noted, and therefore companies such as Applied Materials, Lam and KLA have been offering “confident updates.”\nMeanwhile, demand for memory chips is accelerating, leading to rising prices for NAND and dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. That demand is pressuring semiconductor manufacturers to add capacity, meaning they are placing orders sooner than expected with semicap makers.\n\nSee more: This analyst’s top chip pick isn’t flashy, but it could benefit from ‘unprecedented’ momentum\nTD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar named Applied Materials as his “best idea” for 2026 in a note in December. Sankar wrote that about half of the company’s customers are exposed to the demand for DRAM and to the buildout of leading-edge foundries for manufacturing advanced chips.\nThe other thing investors are excited about is that, eventually, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM TW:2330, Samsung Electronics KR:005930 and Intel INTC “will have to expand clean-room capacity and order more equipment for foundry and logic chips,” Mizuho’s Klein said. Nvidia, Broadcom AVGO, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and others are ordering these types of chips in large quantities.\n\nAnd investors expect to start seeing equipment orders for the sizable data-center commitments from OpenAI and other buyers, including Meta Platforms META and Google GOOGL GOOG, from 2027 onward, he added.\n“The focus in [the memory] sector is going to be how much new equipment is being purchased for new capacity,” Klein said — adding that it’s hard to determine that amount unless memory companies say whether or not they are adding capacity.\nMeanwhile, he believes semicap companies have done a good job managing their supply chains coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. None of the major equipment makers are talking about a shortage of components.\nASML is one of Klein’s favorite semicap stocks going into 2026 because of its monopoly on advanced lithography equipment, which it is not allowed to sell to customers in China.\n\nBoth the investment community and analysts on the sell side who cover ASML are projecting a big recovery in growth in 2027. After a moderation in demand in 2026, a lot of chip manufacturers such as TSMC, Samsung and Intel will start ordering more lithography tools to supply more AI chips from 2027 onward, Klein said. ASML’s valuation may have contracted recently, but there is reason to believe it will start expanding again in the new year, as investors start buying again in anticipation of another growth cycle.\nMeanwhile, Klein said Onto Innovation ONTO and Teradyne TER are two of his favorites among midcap names in the sector because of exposure to high-bandwidth memory.\nTeradyne, which makes tools for testing chips, has said in recent analyst calls that it is seeing increasing orders from HBM customers, Klein noted, and he expects that to continue. There is also an expectation by more bullish investors that Teradyne will work with Nvidia as it expands its test-machine orders beyond Japan’s Advantest JP:6857 ATEYY.\n\nIf that becomes official, it could provide a big boost to Teradyne’s stock. Analysts are already anticipating a big jump in year-over-year revenue growth, to 22.3% in 2026 from an expected 8.7% in 2025 and 5.4% growth in 2024, according to FactSet data.\n“Anytime an equipment company is growing over 15% to 20%, that’s really impressive growth for this type of company,” Klein said.\nOnto, which makes chip-inspection equipment, said on its November earnings call that strength in its advanced packing business is partly from its HBM customers.\nWhile these two names are not inexpensive, Klein said both are guiding for growth acceleration in the second half of 2026, and investors are usually looking for the best growth acceleration in the next six to 12 months.\n\nMeanwhile, Klein added, companies and investors now have more clarity on shipping to customers in China. Demand from that market was a major growth driver for chip-equipment makers in recent years, but investors have been worried about U.S. export controls prompting companies in China to overbuy and stockpile unnecessary tools.\n“That was a big overhang because China was as much as 40% to 45% of these companies’ revenue, and investors were worried that it would come down to a normal rate and create a downward headwind,” Klein said. “The good news is that [in 2026], the restrictions that the U.S. government put in place are already understood and known.”\nDon’t miss: AI slop is taking over the internet.

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia has purchased Intel shares worth $5 billion, carrying out a transaction ‌announced in September.\nThe AI chipmaker had announced back then that it would pay $23.28 per share for Intel ⁠common stock, buying over 214.7 million Intel shares at the price set out in the agreement, as per Monday's filing. The deal forms part of a broader strategic agreement to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers.\nThe share purchase comes just a week after Reuters reported that Nvidia Corp. has halted a test to use Intel’s advanced 18A manufacturing process to make advanced chips. The AI chipmaker tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, the report said.\nInvestors had been closely watching Intel's advanced 18A as a milestone that could help the company compete more directly with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in advanced chip manufacturing. However, the halt now raises concerns about the company’s ability to regain ground in the foundry race.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures, and sells computer products and technologies, delivering data storage, computer, networking, and communications platforms.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors will be pleased with their solid 112% return over the last three years\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThe most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) share price has soared 109% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock!\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring three years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 28% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Apple will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 112% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective Apple shareholders are up 12% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 16% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Apple you should know about.\n\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02\n\nMarketBeat Staff\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nMSFT\n\nRKLB\n\nTSLA\n\nStocks staged a rally on the first day of trading in 2026. It may not be the Santa Claus rally that many investors hoped for, but it aligns with the general sense that the markets will grind higher, despite many stocks being overvalued by traditional metrics.\nLike many of the market rallies in 2025, this one is being led by technology stocks. This may prompt investors to question whether the sector rotation that began in December can be sustained. Or will 2026 be another year when tech stocks, particularly AI stocks, do most of the market&rsquo;s work?\n\nSome of that will hinge on the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s decision on interest rates, which happens in a few weeks. Before then, investors will receive the December Jobs report next Friday, and the week of Jan. 12 will kick off the fourth-quarter earnings season.\n&rarr; Hi Ho Silver Away! Silver Breaks $80 as Poor Man's Gold Explodes\nThe bottom line for investors is that 2026 is shaping up to be just as volatile as 2025. The MarketBeat analysts will continue to analyze the stocks and themes that can affect your portfolio. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week.\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\n&rarr; D-Wave vs. IonQ vs. IBM vs. Google: Which Quantum Bets Will Win 2026?\nThe calendar now reads 2026, but in terms of the stocks that will post strong gains in January, Thomas Hughes has a list of five stocks that evoke 2025 vibes, as artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to be a dominant theme.\n\nOne of the stocks on that list is Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU). In a separate article this week, Hughes wrote why Micron stock&rsquo;s end-of-the-year surge will lead to higher highs in 2026.\n&rarr; MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) wasn&rsquo;t on that list. Nevertheless, Hughes explained why the company still has a constructive long-term setup in the AI trade that is making analysts bullish for 2026.\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nInvesting in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is never boring. This week, Sam Quirke helped investors understand the reason for the recent multi-day slide in TSLA stock and why the first few sessions of 2026 may have a lot to say about the near-term direction of TSLA stock.\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) ended 2025 nearly where it started. Quirke pointed out why the stock is in a consolidation phase and what investors need to hear in the company&rsquo;s upcoming earnings report that could spark a strong upside move.\n2025 was another strong year for technology stocks. However, Quirke highlighted several well-known large-cap stocks that are objectively oversold. Investors seeking asymmetric upside might consider these three names as recovery opportunities in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nEnergy stocks are likely to have a strong year due to the power needs of data centers. This week, Chris Markoch focused on two under-the-radar energy stocks&ndash;one in natural gas and the other in nuclear&ndash;and explained why each may have a bullish setup in 2026.\nThe next Fed decision on interest rates is still weeks away, but it is likely to move markets. Markoch, however, focused on three financial stocks that are likely to benefit regardless of the direction rates move.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock was a market laggard in 2025. But Markoch explained that despite moderating growth expectations, the company&rsquo;s business model and free cash flow support a buy-and-hold decision.\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nMany stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2025, but there was a much smaller list that crushed the index. This week, Ryan Hasson highlighted the three best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the last 12 months and what that could mean for 2026.\nRocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) was a good example of a stock rising to meet the company&rsquo;s story in 2025. RKLB stock was up more than 180% in 2025, and Hasson explained why 2026 could be another breakout year.\nThe biggest market gains have centered on growth stocks, but Hasson reminded investors that there&rsquo;s still room for a disciplined dividend strategy. This week, Hasson pointed investors toward five of MarketBeat&rsquo;s top-rated dividend stocks heading into 2026.\n\nArticles by Leo Miller\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) had a volatile December that put extra attention on some recent insider selling. Leo Miller helped investors understand the reasons behind the sales and why, like with many insider sales, they shouldn&rsquo;t panic.\nAI infrastructure stocks will continue to be top picks in 2026. Savvy investors understand why that category extends beyond chipmakers. This week, Leo Miller analyzed three picks-and-shovels stocks to invest in the AI buildout.\nEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE: LLY) is the dominant name in the GLP-1 weight loss market. However, as Miller noted, the company isn&rsquo;t resting on its laurels. The company is advancing two additional weight loss drugs in 2026, with one up for approval. Positive or negative results will go a long way to charting the near-term course for LLY stock.\n\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nSmall-cap stocks may benefit from the January effect. This week, Nathan Reiff explained what that means for investors and provided a list of three small-cap exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can provide broad exposure to this class of stocks.\nQuantum computing stocks will continue to draw investor attention in 2026. However, investor dollars may become more targeted. Reiff analyzed two pure-play names that have a chance to become profitable in the long run and two large-cap tech giants that offer stock pickers a safer way to play the sector.\nArticles by Dan Schmidt\nGold and silver led a strong move in precious metals in 2025. Many of the reasons for that debasement trade remain in place for 2026. For investors who want alternatives to investing in physical metals, Dan Schmidt analyzed three Canadian mining stocks that should do well, particularly if the U.S. dollar strengthens over the Canadian dollar.\n\nArticles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\nJeffrey Neal Johnson wrote this week about the Application Layer that will be at the forefront of the AI trade. Like the internet buildout, the focus of investors is increasingly turning to the companies that can monetize AI. Johnson explained why three AI pure plays will continue to grow in 2026.\nBefore the ball dropped in 2025, NVIDIA generated its own fireworks with its announcement of its $20 billion acquisition of Groq&rsquo;s assets and leadership. Johnson explained why this marks a key shift in the chip sector as it relates to AI and provided insights into ways to invest in the trend.\nAnother significant announcement to close out 2025 was the Trump administration&rsquo;s executive order to expedite the rescheduling of cannabis. As Johnson noted, this isn&rsquo;t the green light that many investors still hope for, but it does remove some caution flags in terms of cannabis companies and the tax code.\n\nArticles by Jordan Chussler\nMany of the Magnificent Seven stocks were still solid in 2025, but more than half underperformed the S&P 500. However, Jordan Chussler explained why that could be an opportunity for investors. Each one gives investors plenty of reasons to believe they could outperform the index in 2026.\nMuch of the focus on mining stocks centers around gold and silver for good reason. However, one small-cap miner serves as a reminder that investors shouldn&rsquo;t overlook lithium. This week, Chussler explained why this under-the-radar mining stock was up over 1,000% in 2025 and may still have room to run.\nThe article \" MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Jim Grant once said Warren Buffett was trying to warn Americans about US stocks, and he's leaning into this asset class\n\nMoneywise\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 2:23 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nCOF\n\nCOF-PK\n\nCOF-PL\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nIn 2024, the momentum in the U.S. stock market appeared relentless. After a remarkable surge of approximately 26% in the S&P 500 in 2023, the index climbed another 36% in 2024, despite some temporary setbacks earlier in the year.\n\nAmid this bullish backdrop, Jim Grant, editor of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, issued a pointed caution for investors, suggesting that they consider the potential risks of an overheated market.\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“We shouldn't forget that it is at an all time [high], almost everything, price [to] earnings, price [to] book, price [to] sales, what have you, and nor should we forget that the greatest equity investor is about ready to show a balance sheet that's 50-50, with more T-bills than stocks,” he said in an interview with Fox Business.\nGrant was alluding to legendary investor Warren Buffett , implying that Buffett’s pivot toward safer assets like Treasury bills — short-term debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury that mature in one year or less — may be a red flag for investors.\nBuffett’s cash reserve Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stakes in several major holdings in 2024. As a result, the company is sitting on a substantial cash reserve . As of June 30, 2024, Berkshire’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills totaled $276.9 billion.\nParticularly noteworthy is the vast sum Berkshire has allocated to Treasury bills. By August, Berkshire held a whopping $234.6 billion in Treasury bills— more than the U.S. Federal Reserve's own Treasury bill holdings.\n\nIf this market has you feeling like safe money moves are the best ones, look to high-interest savings accounts to grow your net worth over time.\nAnother option is to use an investing platform to your advantage, even for your uninvested money.\nFor example, Public is a commission-free investing platform that democratizes access to a wide range of assets, including stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, treasuries, and alternative investments.\nAs an added bonus, the company offers a high-yield cash account , you can get an industry-leading 4.6% APY with no fees and no minimum balance requirement on uninvested funds. You get unlimited transfers and transactions, plus you can also use Public’s investing products, including their treasury and bonds accounts.\n\nStory Continues",

      "Content": "The Top Stocks to Buy With $50,000 for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 11:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is a key supplier in the AI buildout.\nAmazon's financial success largely depends on the performance of its cloud computing wing.\nAlphabet is emerging as a generative AI leader.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nIf you've got $50,000 that you're looking to invest during 2026, I've got a few stocks that you should consider. Even if you don't have that much to deploy, smaller investments in these three stocks would allow retail investors to benefit from where the market looks to be heading. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) all have strong chances to outperform in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of the high-end chips being deployed in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout. Without its foundry capabilities, we wouldn't have the AI tech that we know today.\nThe investment thesis for Taiwan Semiconductor is fairly simple: Over time, the world will use more chips and more advanced ones. The truth of that premise is fairly obvious if you look at the trends in the tech sector's spending forecasts.\n\nAll of the AI hyperscalers set new records on capital expenditures in 2025, and all of them have said they expect to break those capex records in 2026. This money is being used to purchase land, build data centers, and fill them with the cutting-edge computing hardware required to handle generative AI workloads. Because it is the world's largest third-party foundry operator, Taiwan Semiconductor is manufacturing a major share of the chips going into those data centers, and that hardware isn't cheap.\nEvery time a new data center is constructed, TSMC gets a slice of the spending. With the data center buildout expected to accelerate in 2026 and beyond, Taiwan Semiconductor makes for a strong investment.\nAmazon Amazon is one of those companies constructing data centers for its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the most popular cloud computing option. It's also a major client of Taiwan Semiconductor through some of the chips that it purchases.\nAWS provides 66% of Amazon's total operating profits, so as AWS goes, so goes Amazon.\n\nFortunately for Amazon shareholders, AWS grew revenue at a 20% clip during Q3 -- its fastest rate in several years. With AWS growing rapidly and established as a critical partner for many AI-focused businesses, I think Amazon will be a great stock to invest in during 2026.\nAlphabet Alphabet shares had an incredible 2025, rising by around 65%. That performance isn't likely to be repeated in 2026, as part of it came as the result of the stock starting the year undervalued due to a cluster of concerns.\n\nStory Continues\nNow, it's trading at 30 times forward earnings, a valuation in line with its peers. This means the bulk of Alphabet's stock performance from here will be driven by its business growth, which is trending upward. In Q3, Alphabet reported a strong performance across the board. Revenue rose 16% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 35%.\n\nEven Google Search, the most mature part of Alphabet's business, experienced revenue growth of 15%. This indicates how strong the advertising market is, and as long as that market stays healthy, I have no reason to doubt that Alphabet will be a profitable stock pick in 2026.\nFurthermore, Alphabet has emerged as a leader in the AI realm, thanks to its popular large language model, Gemini. If Alphabet can continue to push boundaries and innovate, it will have a unique cost advantage. Alphabet can afford to keep prices on its models low to beat the competition, which may allow it to become the dominant AI model over the long term. We won't have a clear answer about how that will play out anytime soon, but it's a trend to keep an eye on.\n\nThough it won't repeat 2025's performance in 2026, Alphabet still looks like one of the top stocks to buy right now.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】台股2日「金馬先奔騰」，2026新年首個交易日締造五大紀錄，包括盤中、收盤分別創下29,363點、29,349點同創新高；權王台積電領軍衝鋒收1,585元新高、市值飆上41.1兆元，合計上市櫃市值再締103.38兆元高峰，同步改寫台股新里程碑。\n\n受惠台積電、台達電、聯發科等重量級權值股同步走揚，帶動台股2日開高走高，加權指數終場大漲386點收29,349點，一舉飛躍29,000點關卡，成交量放大至6,697億元，為2025年11月24日7,491億元以來最多，呈現價量齊揚走勢，法人認為這是外資加碼力道轉強，多頭行情可望一波到底，加權指數有望直衝30,000點整數大關。\n\n萬寶投顧董事長朱成志指出，大盤量價齊揚，加上外資近年連續賣超台股，罕見在新年首日回補逾百億元，凸顯資金動能，對盤面走勢看來相當正向，加上美2026年經濟正向，預料在中美雙強競爭趨勢下，台系AI概念股仍將持續受惠，建議聚焦台積電、輝達及美CSP業者周邊供應鏈表現，預料ASIC將扮演金馬要角。\n\n籌碼表現上，外資2日翻多買超120.18億元，大買記憶體雙雄、緯創等，惟賣超台積電4,398張，台指期淨空單減少1,905口至23,154口；投信則延續調節態度再砍41.9億元，連六日賣超224.13億元；自營商轉買超112.36億元，八大公股行庫賣超58.57億元，連六賣共換銀彈205.13億元。\n\n整體來看，群益投顧研究部副總裁曾炎裕表示，CES展預計將以AI應用為焦點，而台積電法說有機會增加資本支出，看好元月法人資金可望大舉回籠，帶動加權指數挑戰30,000點機率增加，但需要換手消化賣壓。\n\n朱成志認為，大盤2025年漲幅超越美那斯達克指數，而先前表現較為弱勢的櫃買指數，則於2025年12月開始轉強，2日寫下一波連九紅佳績，看好中小型股也有表態接棒空間。櫃買指數2日終場上漲1.79點收278.03點，漲幅0.65％。\n\n技術面而言，凱基投顧分析，台股順利突破29,000整數關卡且量能放大有利多頭續漲。\n\n(新聞來源 : 工商時報一陳昱光／台北報導)",

Moreover, AMD will be looking to build a platform, not just offer alternatives.\nCES 2025 recap: what Nvidia and AMD showed last year That said, here’s the lowdown from last year’s event for both tech giants.\nNvidia showed off its powerful Cosmos platform for “physical AI,” positioning it as a foundation for real-world deployment.\nNvidia introduced Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs while highlighting new RTX-PC AI tooling (including NIM microservices/Blueprints).\nAMD rolled out its AI PC portfolio, covering Ryzen AI Max/Max PRO , and expanded Ryzen AI 300 chips tailored to Copilot+ PCs.\nAMD leaned into gaming/graphics with Ryzen X3D desktop chips and Ryzen Z2 handheld processors. Also, it offered previews of the Radeon RX 9070- series (RDNA 4) GPUs and FSR 4.\n\nStory Continues\nAt CES 2026, the real fight is over AI CES 2026 runs January 6 to 9 in Las Vegas , and though it has historically been more of a gadget showcase, this year it’s shaping up to be the year’s first high-stakes tech meeting.\nInvestors expect a needle-moving event, spearheaded by concrete roadmaps, partnerships, and major commitments.\nFor the biggest chipmakers, CES will be all about owning the AI conversation early . Nvidia will seek to reinforce its dominance by rallying partners with demos, keynotes, and industry-wide signaling.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood shells out $1.3 million on biotech stock\nAMD will look to rain on Nvidia’s parade.\nBy spotlighting new PC platforms and capitalizing on a larger OEM market share , AMD will aim to carve out its own lane for AI-driven growth.\nFor perspective, the AI trade has lost its luster lately, and big-name skepticism targets are growing louder.\nFront and center is the “Big Short” Michael Burry , who is openly comparing the current AI frenzy to past manias.\nBurry delivered a scathing takedown of Nvidia.\nThat’s exactly why Nvidia and AMD will be looking for a strong start to set the tone early in 2026.\nBig banks reset targets on Nvidia and AMD Nvidia and AMD both had a solid outing at the stock market last year.\nFor perspective, Nvidia stock ended 2025 up 41% , while AMD posted an 83% gain .\nNow, Wall Street is recalibrating its expectations for 2026, with investors in “show-me” mode when it comes to AI.\nBank of America : Nvidia buy, $275 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nMorgan Stanley : Nvidia overweight, $250 price target; AMD equal weight, $260 price target\nUBS : Nvidia buy, $235 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nGoldman Sachs : Nvidia buy , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $210 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nJPMorgan : Nvidia overweight , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $270 price target\nSource: Barron's\nRelated: Veteran analyst resets AI stock buy list for 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 2, 2026, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

However, semiconductor stocks rallied on a persistently positive outlook for increasing demand from AI.\nWhat this means for investors The first trading day of 2026 was largely positive for investors as the old-school S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes rose, while the bleeding-edge Nasdaq index was flat. While the tech-focused Nasdaq index gave up its early gains, the semiconductor industry delivered exceptional results today with Sandisk rising 16%, ASML up 9%, and Intel moving 7% higher. These increases were tied to continued optimism surrounding the potential for increased AI spending, which could benefit these stocks.\n\nElsewhere, Tesla stock slid 3% as its vehicle deliveries fell short of expectations and BYD overtook the company as the world's largest electric vehicle seller. Last but not least, today marked the first trading day for Greg Abel at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway , following his takeover of the company from Warren Buffett after his legendary 60-year run.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

CES is kicking off on January 6th under the bright lights of Las Vegas, and tech editor Dan Howley is here with what to expect. Dan, tell us.\n00:15 Dan Howley\nYeah, Jared, there's going to be a number of big announcements at this year's show. The the first obviously, will probably, and biggest, be out of Nvidia. They're hosting their own press event on January 5th. CEO Jensen Wong will take the stage. He did it last year as well. They announced a number of new products, a new chip for a smaller bitesize desktop AI computer, as well as a number of different software innovations that they've really been pushing as of late. They also brought out their kind of digital army of robots. It was basically a a a video recording uh and then a little tiny robot uh care of Star Wars uh took the stage alongside of him.\n00:54 Dan Howley\nUh outside of Nvidia, we're also expecting to see AMD host their own press event with CEO Lisa Sue. Uh we'll see Intel and Qualcomm both host press events as well related to their respective chips. Uh and then overall, we should see a ton of AI. I mean, you know, the chips themselves are are, you know, obviously enough to say that AI is going to dominate, but uh you can expect to see a lot of robots, uh a lot of smart home devices. You can even see some wearables that are AI powered. And those usually, you know, so far we haven't seen anything too interesting as far as AI powered wearables outside of maybe, you know, the intelligence built into smart glasses or smart watches. There's never been a dedicated device that's really taken off. Open AI is supposedly working on one, don't expect it at CES. Uh and then finally, uh Autos. Autos have been a big part of CES as of late.\n01:54 Dan Howley\nUh they continue to do so and we'll likely see things ranging from flying cars to uh different types of boats. Uh we know that there'll be some major automakers like Hyundai on hand, uh Sony and Honda, their uh Afeela vehicle will be there as well. Uh and so it's going to be a jam-packed show, but again, I think the big takeaway is going to be from Nvidia. They're the the hottest uh company on the market right now and what they're doing in AI as well as AI from the the rest of the companies at the show.\n02:18 Speaker A\nDan, we got about 30 seconds. So I'm just going to ask you real quickly, any surprises over the last few weeks that have jumped into your attention span uh that might kind of give us a hint of what 2026 has in store for us in tech?\n02:32 Dan Howley\nYeah, I mean the the Nvidia Groc uh kind of licensing deal, non-exclusive licensing deal. Uh I think it was estimated $20 billion. That was really interesting and it just kind of shows where Nvidia sees its its future at this point, you know, making these kinds of investments and new types of chip technologies or different types of chip tech chip technologies to really hold on to the lead that it has.\n03:00 Dan Howley\nUh you know, I I think we're going to continue to see these kinds of not necessarily acquisitions, but you know, licensing agreements will hire some executives from a company, uh things along those lines. Uh they really kind of became popular in 2025 and I think we'll continue to see them through 2026. It's a a way for companies to kind of avoid the scrutiny of acquiring a company, taking it over entirely, while still getting some of that knowhow and IP.\n03:22 Speaker A\nAll right, Dan, appreciate it.

The benchmark S&P 500 rose over 16% for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite led gains with a more-than 20% jump.\n\nNow the focus turns to 2026, though the year will likely begin in earnest come Monday. For stocks, the outlook calls for more optimism. Every Wall Street forecaster tracked by Bloomberg is predicting that stocks will rally for a fourth consecutive year . But plenty of risks remain: The AI boom could falter, the US economy could surprise, and President Trump, of course, remains a wild card as the fate of his most sweeping tariffs could become clearer this month.\nGold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) advanced to open the 2026 trading year, with the precious metals building on their best annual performances since 1979, and aluminum ( ALI=F ) crossed $3,000 per ton for the first time since 2022.\n\nWall Street's bid for a \"Santa Claus rally\" — during the last five trading days of December and first two of January — has so far sputtered. The S&P 500 is down nearly 1% in the period, with investors looking at a third consecutive down \"Santa\" period.\nAmong the top items on Wall Street's 2026 list is the Federal Reserve, where the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 look likely to continue this year. President Trump has promised this month to appoint a new chair to replace Jerome Powell. For now, most traders expect the central bank to hold steady on interest rates later this month, though bets are more split for March's meeting.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 19 updates\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:01 PM UTC Ines Ferré\n\nDow, S&P 500 kick off the first day of trading with gains Stocks kicked off the first day of trading with modest gains as semiconductor stocks lifted the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nThe broad-based index gained nearl 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose 0.6%.

      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Doubled Down on This Iconic Value Stock in His Personal Portfolio With a Fresh $3 Million Investment\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 12:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nKey Points Tim Cook joined Apple just as it was starting a massive turnaround in the late 1990s.\nHe sees another major turnaround opportunity for a great American brand, and he recently doubled his position.\nThe turnaround might take time, but there's significant upside from here if it can succeed.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\n\nTim Cook has consistently demonstrated that he knows how to make smart financial decisions with tremendous upside and limited downside. That was exemplified all the way back in 1998, when he decided to leave a comfortable position at the world's largest PC manufacturer, Compaq, and take a job at a struggling competitor, Apple Computer. He has continued to make smart decisions at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and he has been instrumental in growing the company to become one of the most valuable in the world.\nSuffice to say, Cook knows a good turnaround opportunity when he sees one. And that's why he invested $3 million of his personal portfolio in another company with which he has deep ties, doubling his stake in the business. While recent struggles have caused the stock to plummet, the company possesses several key characteristics that Cook may identify with and should support a successful turnaround.\nHere's why Cook just doubled down on Nike (NYSE: NKE) .\nFinding its footing Former CEO John Donahoe led Nike down the wrong track during his tenure. He exited key wholesale partnerships to focus on direct-to-consumer sales and fell back on key lifestyle franchises instead of investing in commercializing new innovative products. The result was weakening financial performance during his tenure that eventually led to his ouster and former exec Elliott Hill stepping in to replace him, as appointed by the board of directors (of which Cook is a member).\n\nHill took the reins in late 2024 and started implementing his turnaround plan. The \"Win Now\" strategy focuses on product innovation, distinctive brand marketing with premier athlete partnerships, increasing wholesale distribution, and reducing inventory levels for undifferentiated products.\nThe turnaround relies on the company's ability to innovate on athletic wear and leverage its brand equity . Those are two characteristics Cook is deeply familiar with as Apple follows a similar playbook in personal computing.\nSo far, Hill doesn't have much to show for his efforts. Second-quarter revenue climbed 1% year over year, as weakness in China dragged down results. Sales in Greater China fell 17% and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell 35% year over year. That's especially discouraging considering China is one of the biggest and fastest growing sportswear markets in the world. During the earnings call, Hill noted that there's a lot of work to be done to adapt its approach to the region, but it remains a great opportunity.\n\nStory Continues\nOverall, Hill said, \"We're in the middle innings of our comeback.\" While it's faced some setbacks, including costly tariffs imposed in 2025, there's a clear path to return to revenue growth and margin expansion. Hill said it will take some time, but \"we see the path back to double-digit EBIT margins.\"\n\nBut many investors are losing confidence. Shares fell 10% after the earnings release as they feared the turnaround was taking longer than anticipated and profitability would remain pressured for longer. That's when Cook saw an opportunity to buy shares, adding 50,000 shares for an average price of $58.97, according to SEC filings. That's a big vote of confidence that the turnaround is taking shape as Hill expects.\nThe stock might be cheaper than it looks With its declining profits, Nike stock may not appear to be a great value today based on its near-term prospects. However, if it properly leverages its brand strength to reinvigorate sales through wholesale channels with innovative new products, earnings could quickly surpass previous highs before the end of the decade.\n\nThat will come through a combination of modest revenue growth and strong margin expansion. But that will take some time. Fiscal 2026 earnings results will be weighed down by its continued turnaround efforts and tariffs, along with weakness in Greater China. Management warned of continued margin pressure through fiscal 2026.\nOver the medium term, however, the company should be able to overcome those challenges and produce positive results on both the top and bottom lines. A return to double-digit EBIT margin would provide around a 50% boost to profitability from the current fiscal year without any revenue growth (based on the minimum definition of \"double-digit\").\nAs an insider and a seasoned CEO who has overseen a massive turnaround before, Cook has valuable insights into how well Nike's turnaround is progressing. His investment is a signal that it's going better than others are giving it credit for. And if it's a success, the stock looks like a bargain at the current price, close to where Cook added to his position.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

Should You?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nDespite today’s gains, SMCI stock remains down more than 50% versus its October high.\nSignificance of the AI Server Launch for SMCI Stock Supermicro’s new server delivers rack-level performance in a compact footprint, reducing cabling by a remarkable 93% and supporting up to 3TB of memory.\nInvestors cheered the announcement mostly because it positions SMCI as a key player in next-gen AI infrastructure, especially as demand for scalable, energy-efficient solutions continues to ramp in 2026.\n\nAccording to Charles Liang, the chief executive of Super Micro Computer, “this new iteration is the most core-dense SuperBlade we’ve ever created, providing customers with a scalable, efficient platform.”\nWith applications spanning finance, climate modeling, and scientific research, this new AI server strengthens the company’s competitive edge, which is why SMCI shares are pushing higher on Jan 2.\nAre Supermicro Shares Worth Owning in 2026? At a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of about 0.8x currently, SMCI stock appears priced for permanent impairment, despite clear signs of operational momentum.\nMoreover, the AI server specialist has entered 2026 with a $13 billion backlog, offering sufficient visibility into future demand, particularly across artificial intelligence and HPC verticals.\n\nIf the firm delivers on its roadmap and capitalizes on hyperscale infrastructure growth, its current valuation could prove deeply discounted.\nNote that Supermicro shares now look headed to challenge their 20-day moving average (MA) at $31.86 level, a break above which could further accelerate upward momentum in the near term.\nWhat’s the Consensus Rating on SMCI Shares? Long-term investors could also take heart in the fact that Wall Street remains bullish on Supermicro stock for 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nThe consensus rating on SMCI shares currently sits at “Moderate Buy” with the mean target of about $47 indicating potential upside of another 50% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Wajeeh Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares of server solutions provider Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) jumped 5.7% in the afternoon session after the company unveiled a new high-density server designed for demanding AI and high-performance computing workloads.\nThe new 6U SuperBlade platform featured both direct liquid and standard air cooling and utilized dual Intel Xeon 6900 Series processors. Supermicro stated this design packed more computing power into less space, allowing for up to 25,600 cores per rack, which was important as modern data centers faced power and cooling limits. The company highlighted that the system could reduce cabling by up to 93% and decrease space requirements by approximately 50% compared to traditional servers. This product launch addressed the growing need for advanced cooling solutions driven by increasingly powerful AI chips.\n\nIs now the time to buy Super Micro? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Super Micro’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 68 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock dropped 4% on the news that investors rotated out of AI-linked high-flyers following underwhelming earnings updates from Oracle and Broadcom as the core thesis shifted from \"growth at any cost\" to \"prove the returns.\". Oracle triggered the alarm by missing revenue estimates while simultaneously hiking capital expenditures by $15 billion. This reignited fears that AI infrastructure spending is outpacing actual monetization. Broadcom compounded the anxiety; despite beating earnings, its stock fell as CFO Kirsten Spears cautioned that gross margins may come under pressure as product mix shifts further toward system-level AI sales. This sparked a macro rotation away from AI infrastructure and power plays.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of Super Micro’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $9,984.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

      "Content": "3 Cash-Flow Machines Investors May Want Heading Into 2026\n\nNathan Reiff, MarketBeat\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 10:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nXOM\n\nGILD\n\nKey Points Strong cash flow is a crucial indicator of a company's healthy operations, enabling it to pay down debt, enhance shareholder value, and sustain long-term growth.\nSemiconductor firm Qualcomm stands out for its 15% year-over-year cash flow growth in the last quarter.\nGilead Sciences and Exxon Mobil both have healthy cash flows, allowing for attractive dividend distributions.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nOf the host of financial metrics investors might consider when deciding whether to buy shares of a target company, cash flow is among the most important. Operating cash flow is a reflection of how a firm actually functions on a day-to-day basis and demonstrates the company's ability to bring in money from sales or other sources and to adequately pay salaries, taxes, and other expenses. Free cash flow, on the other hand, shows what is left over to the company after accounting for operating expenses and capital expenditures (CapEx)—this is the discretionary cash available for things like expansion, shareholder returns, mergers and acquisitions, and more.\nA company's cash flow keeps it operating, supports the possibility of growth and expansion, and lowers the risk of bankruptcy. Many investors also find it a metric that is more difficult to manipulate in a financial report than net income, which may look better or worse depending upon accounting methods. Heading into the new year, investors looking for strong cash flow might start with some of the firms below.\n\n→ Hi Ho Silver Away! Silver Breaks $80 as Poor Man's Gold Explodes\nRecord Free Cash Flow for a Growing Semiconductor Firm Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) is a major provider of semiconductors for use in phones, vehicles, and various smart devices. Shares displayed fairly steady momentum in the last two-thirds of 2025, trending upward from April through the end of the year, but Qualcomm's rally has still brought it short of the astronomical valuations of some of its semiconductor rivals.\n\nFor investors looking for cash-generating potential, though, Qualcomm may stand out thanks to its $12.8 billion in free cash flow in the most recently reported quarter, up 15% year-over-year (YOY) and a quarterly record for the company. Operating cash flow also increased significantly as well, thanks to particularly strong sales growth in both Qualcomm's handset and automotive divisions. This means that, despite significant capital spending, Qualcomm ended the quarter with about $7.8 billion in cash reserves—this is mostly unchanged YOY, but indicates a strong financial position heading into the next quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n→ D-Wave vs. IonQ vs. IBM vs. Google: Which Quantum Bets Will Win 2026?\nQualcomm's healthy cash flow should allow it to continue its efforts to expand into high-demand data centers in 2026, while simultaneously keeping up its commitment to strong shareholder returns—the company's dividend yield is an attractive 2.08%.\n\nHigh Margins and Growing Sales Drive Continued Cash Flow Success Biopharma giant Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD), known for its antiviral therapies for HIV, hepatitis, and more, benefits from climbing sales and strong margins. In the latest quarter, for instance, its HIV medication Descovy saw sales surge by 20% YOY. Gilead also does not rely on a single product or even a particular medical focus, with a broad portfolio covering liver disease, oncology applications, and more.\n\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02\nFree cash flow for the last quarter was almost $4 billion alongside noteworthy operating cash flow of $4.1 billion. Cash flow is especially important for a biopharmaceutical company because the industry requires massive continual investment in R&D. Gilead is in a healthy position to keep developing its pipeline thanks to its cash reserves and flow.\nHaving cash on hand also allows the company to pay out a compelling dividend ahead of many of its healthcare sector peers, with a dividend yield of 2.57% and a payout ratio of just under 49%. Shares of GILD climbed by more than a third in 2025, but analysts still see room for further growth in the new year.\nHuge Oil and Gas Operation Still Maintains Strong Cash Flow The second-largest oil and gas company globally by market capitalization, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) is valued at more than half a trillion dollars, with cash flow in line with that scale as well as the company's large upstream and refining business.\nOperating cash flow was $14.8 billion in the latest quarter, and free cash flow came in at $6.3 billion despite fairly high CapEx.\n\nThis is to be expected from the oil and gas industry, which is significantly capital-intensive.\nDespite its massive size, Exxon maintains healthy liquidity and cash flow.\nNot only is this key to its continued operational success and potential expansion, but it has also allowed the company to be a major dividend player, with a yield of 3.42% and more than four decades of consistent increases.\nThe article \" 3 Cash-Flow Machines Investors May Want Heading Into 2026 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Broadcom Stock a Buy After the Dip?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:43 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Some investors are feeling skittish about the high levels of capital spending on AI.\nOne important player, Broadcom, has a big opportunity in custom chip production.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nSemiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the big winners in the recent generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom that started with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. Shares have soared by roughly 350% in three years as investors bet on its ability to capitalize on the soaring demand for advanced computing hardware.\n\nThat said, some market participants feel that the AI boom might be getting ahead of itself as companies overspend on data centers without a meaningful guarantee of future returns. This uncertainty has sent Broadcom's stock down by around 15% from its all-time high of $412.\nLet's dig deeper into the pros and cons of the stock to see if this dip is a buying opportunity or a signal for investors to stay far away.\nWhy are investors getting nervous? The stock's recent slide came after Broadcom's fourth-quarter earnings report in mid-December. On the surface, the numbers were fantastic.\nRevenue jumped 28% year over year to a record of $18 billion, driven by soaring demand for AI semiconductor revenue, which rose 74% in the period. This operating segment reflects sales of Broadcom's advanced computer hardware to AI data centers, and management expects the momentum to continue into 2026 as demand for these products continues to surge.\n\nBroadcom's bottom line is also looking great, with net income doubling to $8.5 billion. With numbers like these, it's hard to believe shares are on a two-week downtrend. However, the correction makes more sense when you look at some of the uncomfortable dynamics of the AI industry itself.\nAccording to analysts at Goldman Sachs , hyperscalers are on track to spend an eye-popping $527 billion on AI-related capital expenditures (capex) , with some of this going to hardware produced by companies like Broadcom. The problem is that the scale of the spending doesn't really match up with the profits generated by AI-related software services.\nDeutsche Bank expects ChatGPT creator OpenAI to lose $140 billion by 2029. And despite being one of the top hardware spenders (with roughly $125 billion in capex for 2025), Amazon saw its cloud computing revenue rise by a relatively modest $5.6 billion compared to the prior-year period. The fear is that eventually shareholders will start to push back on all the AI spending. After all, this is money that could be going to buybacks or dividends.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom might be better positioned than Nvidia It is fair to assume that AI-related capex spending could soon drop to reasonable levels, which could reduce the growth potential of infrastructure providers like Broadcom. That said, the company is better positioned to weather a potential fallout than the industry leader, Nvidia. To understand why, we must first look at the reasons why AI development is so expensive and generally unprofitable right now.\n\nRunning and training large language models like ChatGPT requires thousands of expensive AI accelerators (such as Nvidia's Blackwell series), which consume significant amounts of energy. Broadcom's semiconductor business actually helps solve this problem by helping its clients develop appl ication-specific integrated circui ts (ASICs). These are custom chips designed to do a specific workload, making them cheaper and easier to run than Nvidia's large, general-purpose chips.\nObviously, ASICs won't be the magic bullet that makes AI companies stop burning through money. But they are the natural first step as companies seek to reduce their reliance on expensive third-party hardware. In October, cloud giant Google selected Broadcom to build its first in-house AI processor chips. This development follows a deal with OpenAI to co-develop AI accelerators and Ethernet solutions.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy? Broadcom's ability to benefit from the transition to custom chips makes it a strong bet in the generative AI opportunity. That said, the AI boom is getting long in the tooth, and investors may want to wait until there is more clarity about the sustainability of current industry hardware spending before taking a position in such a highly exposed stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Dear AMD Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 5\n\nChris MacDonald\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:08 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nAmong the world's largest semiconductor makers, Nvidia (NVDA) remains the go-to choice for investors. And rightfully so—looking at this stock's long-term chart, investors who have stuck with this name have outperformed the market by an incredible margin in recent decades.\nOf course, it's not just a one-horse race, regardless of what the media tries to tell you. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is another top name worth considering, and one that's actually outperformed Nvidia on a year-to-date basis (YTD). Surging 77% to end 2025, AMD roughly doubled Nvidia's performance this year (the world's largest chipmaker still surged 39% higher in 2025, so not bad). Thus, there are plenty of eyeballs already on AMD as 2026 kicks off.\n\nMore News from Barchart NVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\nAfter Record Runs for Western Digital and Sandisk in 2025, Consider This 1 Data Center Storage Stock for 2026\nCrowdStrike Insiders Are Offloading CRWD Stock.

Sign Up Now!\nAs it turns out, there's another major catalyst on the horizon investors are watching when it comes to both companies. Analysts at Wedbush have pointed out that AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, is expected to make the keynote address at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on this date, with the potential for a big announcement to come.\n\nWhy Is This Catalyst So Important for AMD? I think the key announcements for AMD for this coming year are indeed likely to come at this event. CES is the biggest show in the world when it comes to anything tied to consumer electronics and is honestly one of the key shows I've always wanted to attend, for this reason. Many CEOs are expected to make big product announcements, from technological upgrades to next-generation technology expected to be released over the course of the year.\n\nI'd expect to see a strong narrative from Lisa Su around the company's roadmap moving forward, and Wedbush analysts tend to agree. They think that some “significant” technological improvements to AMD's core Ryzen chips could be announced at this conference. Doing so may propel a range of mega-cap tech companies who are looking for reasons to buy AMD chips (at a lower price point) to do so. Especially if the output differential between these Ryzen chips and Nvidia's new Blackwell and Rubin chips isn't as wide as it appears now.\n\nStory Continues\nWe'll have to see, of course, what is ultimately announced. But any sort of meaningful improvements in AMD's core CPU chip technology could spur greater investor interest in 2026 and take this stock's recent momentum to new levels. It does appear that AMD has retained strong pricing power, reflected in the company's margins above. If these margins expand further in the coming quarters, and AMD can show a cash flow growth profile that's above Wall Street estimates, I certainly think this is a stock that could be off to the races.\n\nSo, What Does Wall Street Think? As it turns out, Wedbush is just one of 44 analysts currently covering AMD stock. With a consensus price target of $285.05 per share on AMD stock, analysts believe that this chipmaker could have roughly 33% upside from current levels.\nThat's a healthy potential gain for investors looking to add some momentum to their portfolios in 2026. Indeed, momentum-driven growth stocks have provided most of the gains in the markets over the course of the past decade and a half. Thus, for those who think this trend is likely to continue and risk-on sentiment will remain in the coming year, AMD's fundamentals do point in a very positive direction right now.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 5.3% in the morning session after investor optimism grew following favorable analyst predictions for 2026 and anticipation of new product announcements.\nThe move came as top Wall Street analysts predicted a potential 32% jump in the stock's value for 2026, building on significant gains from the previous year. This positive outlook was tied to AMD's role in the artificial intelligence sector, driven by demand for high-performance computing and data centers. Adding to the excitement were rumors that the company planned to reveal a new, faster Ryzen chip and a new generation of processors at the upcoming CES 2026 conference. AMD's stock also benefited from a broader rally in tech stocks, as fresh excitement surrounding the prospects of AI lifted the sector.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $220.34, up 2.9% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us AMD’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 30 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago when the stock gained 6.8% on the news that investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains. Technology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Companies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflects a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity. The rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented companies.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,387.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened.

That could be things like new graphics cards for gamers, uh new partnerships, things along those lines, but they've also expanded out\n01:00 Dan Howley\nto try to push more of their AI side uh of the business. So, you know, last year we saw Jensen talk about the robots as you kind of mentioned, uh their software offerings through Nvidia, as well as some of their future plans for smaller uh form factor devices which they released this year, uh a desktop kind of AI server that individuals can use on their own. Uh AMD did the same thing basically uh with their own event. And we're also going to be seeing some some announcements from Intel and Qualcomm. So, it really is going to focus primarily\n01:39 Dan Howley\nout of the gate on Nvidia uh and AMD. And then, you know, AI hardware is going to be another large part of the show. We've had uh, you know, companies like Microsoft, HP, Dell, uh any computer maker kind of discussing this idea of AI hardware when it comes to AI PCs. Not just that though. You could see some wearables that are AI focused, maybe some pendants, you know, things along those lines. Um, there's sure to be some vaporware mixed in there. Uh, you know, just products that get announced and then\n02:20 Dan Howley\nnever really see the light of day or they're just kind of looking for acquisitions down the line. Uh and so that those are some of the the other products. And then, you know, I think one of the other things that people really have uh kind of noticed over the years is the change for a lot of CES towards kind of an auto show uh motif where, you know, an entire hall is dedicated to automotives. and not just cars though, there's uh flying car concepts, uh different types of drones.\n02:56 Dan Howley\nLast year or the year before, there was a uh multi-ton uh Caterpillar dump truck that was supposed to have autonomous capabilities. John Deere uh is there. Uh there's a bunch of different boating companies. So transportation in general gets a lot of love uh at CES and we're expected to see more of that this year. Of course, AI will be a big part of that. Uh self-driving is a huge push, uh seeing a huge push. It's it's been kind of, you know, what one of the biggest announcements that we see at CES every year or\n03:33 Dan Howley\nkind of the prediction of when we'll get actual full self-driving. You know, there's still a bunch of kings to be worked out if you've seen any of the latest news out of Weimo. But uh it is much better than it was. Um but yeah, I mean it it it does seem as though this year is going to just be completely dominated by AI.\n03:55 Jared\nYou know, I love that we're still trying to make flying cars a thing. It's only been about 70 years. Maybe it's going to happen this year. But I want to talk to you about AI and the broad picture for 2026 because AI is appearing in everything right now and we're used to talking about large language models or LLM's. Now I've been talking about small language models or SLM slim with a number of guests and that is you you can put these these language models in a device and it can compute its own\n04:29 Jared\nAI. That's one trend, but uh what are some of the others or any comments on what I've said here?\n04:36 Dan Howley\nYeah, I mean, the those smaller language models, you'll see on uh things like those uh AIPCs, you know, uh Microsoft's been making a huge push with that. Uh as I said, along those, along uh the partner manufacturers, the HPs, uh Dells, things along those lines. Uh smartphone makers also lean heavily on those. But I think we'll just continue to see these kind of questions circle around the the eventual payoff with AI. Where where this actually does go. And you know, there's been survey after survey saying, oh, some companies are\n05:17 Dan Howley\nare doing great when it comes to AI, when it comes to getting a return or seeing improved uh uh efficiencies. Others times we've seen things where it says, well, companies aren't really seeing a return. I think that's going to continue to be a big part of this conversation with regards to AI. Uh also, how much money is going to be funneled into it uh is going to continue to be a big part of the conversation. You know, the the hyperscalers, hundreds of billions of dollars are being pumped in through uh data center build out. Uh that's going to\n05:54 Dan Howley\nbe a big topic of conversation, whether or not there'll be a pull back on spending, if Nvidia can keep it up. But, you know, I I think really it's going to be that kind of up and down that we saw over the last year where, you know, there was this sense of everything's great, you know, euphoria reigns, and then kind of the the storm clouds come in when there's any hint of bad news. Uh I think it's going to continue to kind of be that way in this year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: AVGO ) ranks among the best AI stocks to buy according to analysts . Citing robust development in the AI semiconductor industry, Benchmark increased its price target for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) from $385 to $485 on December 12, retaining a Buy rating on the company’s shares. According to Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), its AI semiconductor division achieved $6.5 billion in Q4, improving 76% year-over-year and 25% sequentially.\nThe company reported $21 billion in orders from Anthropic over the last two quarters, while its six-quarter AI order backlog climbed to $73 billion. Broadcom’s list of clients now includes giants like Meta, ByteDance, and Google, as well as an additional contract with OpenAI to supply $1 billion in chips by late 2026.\n\nAccording to Reuters, while Broadcom’s backlog is scheduled to ship over the next 18 months, CFO Kirsten Spears warned that margins could fall. She stated that the Q1 consolidated gross margin is likely to fall roughly 100 basis points sequentially, owing to a higher percentage of AI revenue.\nAnalysts quoted by Reuters emphasize two main risks for the company, including its excessive concentration on just five AI customers, and weaker margins on AI systems, which are likely to account for a greater share of the total revenue in coming quarters, notably in the second half of fiscal year 2026.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies various semiconductor devices and infrastructure software solutions worldwide. The company operates in two segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Now rinse out that champagne glass and pop some Advil because the tech industry’s biggest show of the year, CES, kicks off on Jan. 6 under the bright lights of Las Vegas.\nCompanies big and small will take over the famed Strip and Las Vegas Convention Center, debuting their latest and greatest offerings, and a good helping of fly-by-night products that’ll never see the light of day.\n\nWhile the show officially begins on Jan. 6, the festivities start a few days earlier with events like CES Unveiled and press conferences featuring Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang and AMD ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su. And that means you can expect artificial intelligence to be front and center at the trade show.\nThat will include everything from AI-focused PCs to new chips. But robots are looking like they’ll steal the spotlight in 2026.\n“​Every year CES has a theme. And sometimes you don't know what it is until you get to the show, and everybody's talking about it” explained Kinsey Fabrizio, president of the Consumer Technology Association trade organization, which runs CES.\n“But we can tell you right now, robotics is going to be talked about … big time at CES.”\n\nYahoo Finance will be live and in person in Vegas bringing you all of the latest news and announcements. Here’s what we’re anticipating at CES 2026.\nWhat to expect at CES CES has become a kind of battleground for chipmakers and designers to show off their wares to the world right alongside their biggest rivals.\nLast year, Nvidia was the talk of Las Vegas when Huang held a keynote in front of a massive audience at the Michelob Ultra Arena, debuting the company's newest lineup of gaming chips, a desktop-sized AI rig, and a variety of AI software services and platforms.\nThis year, you can expect even more from the company that closed out 2025 with a $4.5 trillion market cap. Huang, who is scheduled to take the stage at 1:00 p.m. PT on Jan. 5 will likely unveil new gaming offerings, as well as a host of AI apps and capabilities.\nAMD’s Su will then host her own keynote a few hours later at 6:30 p.m. PT, giving that company’s rebuttal to Nvidia’s announcements and providing updates on its own gaming and AI products.\n\nJim Johnson, Senior vice president and GM of Intel's ( INTC ) Client Computing Group, which covers sales of the company’s chips for consumer and enterprise PCs, will also hold a keynote at CES 2026 where he’s expected to provide updates on Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, chips.\nThe processors, which Intel initially revealed in October, are the first to use the company’s highly anticipated 18A chip technology, and are a key part of its broader turnaround effort.\n\nStory Continues\nQualcomm ( QCOM ) will also be on hand at CES, with CEO Cristiano Amon set to participate in a fireside chat with Fortune’s Andrew Nusca. Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon X-series processors for Windows PCs during CES 2025 and will likely build on that momentum at this year’s event.\nEach of the chipmakers will likely provide insights into their plans to power physical AI systems, a technical term for robots, during the show.\nExpect to see humanoid robots on display, as well as a number of robotic arms, AI-powered drones, and self-driving cars scattered across Las Vegas this year, as the industry looks to rapidly advance the technology.\nSpeaking of cars, CES has become a major showcase for the auto industry’s tech ambitions, and this year will be no different. The show will likely include flying car concepts, a mainstay in recent years, as well as a variety of ways car companies are looking to capitalize on the AI trend by incorporating the technology into their vehicles’ dashboards.\n\nAI-powered wearables and fitness trackers could also make their debut at CES 2026. Those can come in the form of smart rings, glasses, or pins. The smart glasses space in particular has gained plenty of attention with the launch of Meta’s ( META ) Ray-Ban Display glasses in September, and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Samsung planning their own smart glasses.\nApple ( AAPL ) is also reportedly looking to get into the smart glasses game, though the company eschews making an appearance at CES in favor of hosting its own highly polished events at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., throughout the year.\nNaturally, there are sure to be some outlandish products at CES 2026. Over the years, we’ve seen everything from smart toilets to forks designed to help you eat healthier foods.\nIt’s sure to be an interesting show, and Yahoo Finance will bring you all of the biggest announcements as they happen.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, Marvell Technology’s data center segment posted revenues of $1.52 billion, growing 37.8% year over year, led by strong traction in custom XPU silicon products.\n\nMarvell Technology expects its custom silicon business to roughly contribute to one-fourth of its overall data center revenues and grow at least 20% next year. The company recently unveiled 18 XPU and XPU-attach socket design wins, among which many are already in volume production.\nThese design wins include full custom XPU programs, XPU-attached silicon, electrical I/O chiplets integrated inside multi-die XPU packages and other products, contributing to a pipeline of more than 10% of a $75 billion lifetime revenue funnel. MRVL’s custom silicon strategy has evolved from a niche application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) offering into a deeply embedded, multi-year hyperscaler partnership model.\nNow, Marvell Technology develops custom ASIC designs for AI, cloud data center and OEM customers using its advanced 5nm and 3nm processes like 112G XSR serializer/de-serializer (SerDes), Long Reach SerDes, PCIe Gen 6 SerDes. These capabilities enable MRVL to stay ahead of its competitors in the custom AI silicon space.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against MRVL Broadcom AVGO is one of the leading suppliers of custom silicon solutions for data center, service provider and enterprise networking customers. Broadcom’s advanced 3.5D XDSiP packaging platform is specifically designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of custom AI XPUs.\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD is another player in the custom silicon solutions and AI accelerator space with its semi-custom SoC offerings and Instinct Accelerators that power numerous data centers. Advanced Micro Devices’ reconfigurable Alveo Adaptable Accelerator Cards are used to speed up compute-intensive applications in data centers.\n\nWhile Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices are formidable players in the custom silicon space for AI acceleration, Marvell Technology’s deep partnership with NVIDIA provides MRVL necessary support to sustain in this space.\nMRVL's Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Marvell Technology have gained 13.1% in the past six months compared with the Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s growth of 22.3%.\nMRVL 6-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Marvell Technology is trading at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 7.31X, lower than the industry’s average of 8.46X.\n\nStory Continues\nMRVL Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 81% and 26%, respectively.

      "Content": "Those who invested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) five years ago are up 89%\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nGenerally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 59% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 28%, including dividends.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.9% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 58.57.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Analog Devices will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective It's nice to see that Analog Devices shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Analog Devices has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory Continues\nOf course Analog Devices may not be the best stock to buy .

      "Content": "2 Reasons to Like QCOM (and 1 Not So Much)\n\nKayode Omotosho\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 8:04 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\nQualcomm trades at $171.30 per share and has stayed right on track with the overall market, gaining 5.5% over the last six months. At the same time, the S&P 500 has returned 9.9%.\nIs now the time to buy QCOM? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nWhy Does QCOM Stock Spark Debate? Having been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\nTwo Positive Attributes: 1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Luckily, Qualcomm’s sales grew at an impressive 15.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n2. Stellar ROIC Showcases Lucrative Growth Opportunities Growth gives us insight into a company’s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? A company’s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nQualcomm’s five-year average ROIC was 47%, placing it among the best semiconductor companies. This illustrates its management team’s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\nOne Reason to be Careful: Projected Revenue Growth Is Slim Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Qualcomm’s revenue to rise by 3%, a deceleration versus its 15.3% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nFinal Judgment Qualcomm’s merits more than compensate for its flaws, but at $171.30 per share (or 14.2× forward P/E), is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\n\nStory continues\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions If your portfolio success hinges on just 4 stocks, your wealth is built on fragile ground. You have a small window to secure high-quality assets before the market widens and these prices disappear.\nDon’t wait for the next volatility shock. Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-small-cap company Exlservice (+354% five-year return).

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】大摩日前發布報告，點名亞洲AI前十強，其中台灣包含台積電、聯發科、京元電、信驊、世芯、創意等6檔上榜，統一投顧總經理、PCB女王廖婉婷認為，6檔當中世芯股價低、成長性夠，是2026開門就可以找買點的個股；如果眼光放遠，創意、聯發科續航力強勁；而台積電則是「神主牌」，本土法人遲早會回補。\n\n大摩選的台股六強都是優質個股，如果硬要挑該如何選擇？廖婉婷在「鈔錢部署」中表示，自己會先考慮獲利成長性，如果基期夠低，2026就比較有機會。\n\n她以世芯-KY(3661)為例，2025業績呈現衰退，但因為它是AWS Trainium 3供應鏈，屬於後段ASIC供應商，因此2026的業績貢獻度會很大，光是AWS貢獻世芯營收成長就接近1倍，獲利更會有1倍以上的成長，目前本益比才20出頭，空間還蠻大。\n\n世芯前3季歸屬母公司業主淨利為41.14億元，年減10.7％，每股純益為50.89元，較去年同期58.43元衰退13%，主因是北美主要CSP客戶5奈米AI晶片在2025年畫句點，法人預估世芯2025年EPS為67.8元。\n\n廖婉婷表示，世芯大客戶AWS的Trainium 3大概會在第2季出，通常法人布局都會提前1季，因此當跨入元月1日、2026第1季剛開始的時候就可以加碼。\n\n除世芯外，2026年會打進馬斯克的xAI的創意(3443)，也是廖婉婷長期看好個股。馬斯克先前發下豪語，2027年的AI晶片需求會比全市場目前用的GPU加ASIC來得更多。\n\n大客戶因台積電產能，喜歡和台灣ASIC廠合作廖婉婷分析，如果以Robotaxi，加上他的AI機器人大軍有可能成真，果真如此，對創意2027年的業績貢獻將會很大。\n\n另外聯發科(2454)也是從消費性產品打進ASIC市場，不過它Google的TPU下一代要等到2026年下半年、甚至第4季才可能出貨，所以業績貢獻會比較慢，但市場認為，即使到2027年再下一代，聯發科還是會是供應商。\n\n對於國外的客戶偏好找台灣的IP廠商合作ASIC，廖婉婷說，原因是台廠和台積電合作緊密，大家都想拿到台積電的產能，再加上台灣的封測產業很強，因此讓國際大廠頻頻登門合作。\n\n廖婉婷評估大摩挑選的6檔中，世芯因為股價低、成長性夠強，會有很大的成長空間，被認為是首選；但如果需要續航力、把眼光放大2027年，創意和聯發科都有很大成長機會。\n\n至於台積電是「神主牌」，廖婉婷說，一定會帶領台股再創新高，台股現在本益比23、24倍，台積電本益比才20倍，對台積電而言股價太委屈。\n\n她分析，主要是先前外資放假、內資減碼，加上年底壽險銀行必須獲利了結，以及會計制度改變，以及外價金的提列得減碼，所以很多金控銀行壽險年底會減低持股，明年第1季外資、本土法人會回補台積電，台積電的本益比至少應回到22倍到24倍之上。\n\n※免責聲明：文中所提之個股、ETF內容，並非任何投資建議與參考，請審慎判斷評估風險，自負盈虧。(新聞來源：旺得富理財網 王郁惠)",

      "Content": "The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10%\n\nSam Quirke, MarketBeat\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 11:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nKey Points Qualcomm’s MACD just flipped bearish again, and the stock is already slipping after a strong run from April.\nA similar signal in early November was followed by a fast, double-digit drop, making this setup hard to ignore.\nThe near-term “tell” is whether buyers defend the low-$170s, or whether the stock breaks down ahead of February earnings.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAfter showing many promising signs over the past quarter, shares of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) are flashing a sudden warning signal as the new year begins. Just before Christmas, the stock’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) chart logged a bearish crossover, confirming a momentum shift that has continued into this week. The mega-cap tech stock closed just below $174 on Dec. 30, still up roughly 40% since April, but also down about 15% from the late-October surge that briefly reignited bullish enthusiasm.\nSince then, however, Qualcomm has been narrowing into a tight range, and while its long-term fundamentals remain supportive, its short-term technicals are flashing caution. What makes it all the more noteworthy is that the last time this exact setup appeared, the outcome was not kind to the bulls. Could history be about to repeat itself? Let’s jump in and take a closer look.\n\n→ Hi Ho Silver Away! Silver Breaks $80 as Poor Man's Gold Explodes\nWhat Qualcomm’s Bearish MACD Crossover Signals Now The MACD is a momentum indicator that tracks the relationship between two moving averages. When the shorter-term average crosses below the longer-term one, it’s regarded as a reliable signal that upside momentum is fading and that sellers are beginning to gain the upper hand. Importantly, this is not just an intraday wobble. The crossover that appeared just before Christmas has now continued and picked up pace into this week.\n\nThat matters because MACD signals tend to be more reliable when they appear after extended rallies. Qualcomm’s run since April has been one of its most sustained in years, and so this sudden divergence could be an early warning that buyers are starting to step back, rather than to continue building positions.\n→ D-Wave vs. IonQ vs. IBM vs. Google: Which Quantum Bets Will Win 2026?\nNow, it doesn’t mean a breakdown from here is inevitable. But it does suggest that the stock is vulnerable if bulls fail to step in soon, especially given how the stock behaved the last time this happened.\nThe Last Time QCOM Flashed This Signal, Shares Dropped 10% The most recent comparison point came less than two months ago in early November. At the time, Qualcomm had also printed a bearish MACD crossover after a strong move to multi-year highs. In a move that surprised us all, what followed was a swift decline of more than 10% over the following two weeks.\n\nStory Continues\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02\nThe setup then shares several similarities with today. The stock had been moving higher into the middle of December since bottoming out from November’s correction, but in the face of increased selling pressure over the past fortnight, the bulls have been nowhere to be seen.\n\nHistory might not repeat perfectly when it comes to stocks, but it often rhymes. The point isn’t so much that Qualcomm is definitely going to fall another 10% from here; it’s that, at the very least, the stock is flashing a warning signal that is worth noting.\nWhy This Qualcomm Setup Could Play Out Differently There are also reasons not to be overly negative. Unlike early November, Qualcomm hasn’t just retreated from a multi-year high, and is actually starting to trade within a tightening range. With the longer-term uptrend still intact, it could be said to have been coiling into a pre-breakout setup over the past week, more so than starting to break down.\n\nIts fundamentals also look as strong as they have all year, with expectations building for Qualcomm to once again top the consensus in their first earnings report of 2026, due in early February. As we’ve highlighted in recent weeks, too, investor perception has been improving as the company’s diversification efforts continue to build momentum.\nEspecially when the broader equity market is in risk-on mode, this underlying narrative supports higher prices over time, even if the near-term path is choppy. That longer-term view is supported by TradeSmith’s Health Indicator, a volatility-based metric that has consistently ranked Qualcomm in the green zone for six consecutive months.\n\nWhat Bulls Must Do for Qualcomm to Start 2026 Strong Still, for Qualcomm to start 2026 on the right foot, the bulls need to reassert control soon. If the stock continues to drift lower below $172, it would significantly increase the odds of another leg down similar to November’s move.\nConversely, if buyers step in and momentum begins to turn back up, this crossover could prove to be a false alarm within a broader uptrend. Having worked hard to shake off its reputation for exasperating investors with multiple false promises, Qualcomm has earned some benefit of the doubt after its strong performance since April, but that goodwill is not unlimited.\nThe next week or two will tell a lot. A stock can coil only for so long before it has to choose a direction, one way or the other. With its fundamentals pointing higher and technicals pulling in the opposite direction, Qualcomm is approaching a moment of decision.\nThe article \" The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10% \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The amount of data we ingest is also increasing exponentially, leading to elevated demand for chips with more processing power. This secular trend bodes well for the industry, which has posted a six-month gain of 32.6% and beat the S&P 500 by 21.3 percentage points.\n\nAlthough these businesses have produced results lately, investors should tread carefully as not all companies are equipped for the next technological innovation. With that said, here are three semiconductor stocks that may face trouble.\nAnalog Devices (ADI) Market Cap: $132.8 billion\nFounded by two MIT graduates, Ray Stata and Matthew Lorber in 1965, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is one of the largest providers of high performance analog integrated circuits used mainly in industrial end markets, along with communications, autos, and consumer devices.\nWhy Is ADI Not Exciting?\n\nSales tumbled by 5.4% annually over the last two years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle\nUnderwhelming 5.9% return on capital reflects management’s difficulties in finding profitable growth opportunities\nAnalog Devices is trading at $271.51 per share, or 27.8x forward P/E. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including ADI in your portfolio, it’s free for active Edge members .\nAmtech (ASYS) Market Cap: $180.2 million\nFocusing on the silicon carbide and power semiconductor sectors, Amtech Systems (NASDAQ:ASYS) produces the machinery and related chemicals needed for manufacturing semiconductors.\nWhy Are We Cautious About ASYS?\nCustomers postponed purchases of its products and services this cycle as its revenue declined by 16.3% annually over the last two years\nAbility to fund investments or reward shareholders with increased buybacks or dividends is restricted by its weak free cash flow margin of 6.6% for the last two years\nPush for growth has led to negative returns on capital, signaling value destruction, and its falling returns suggest its earlier profit pools are drying up\n\nAmtech’s stock price of $12.54 implies a valuation ratio of 32.4x forward P/E. If you’re considering ASYS for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more .\nFormFactor (FORM) Market Cap: $4.32 billion\nWith customers across the foundry and fabless markets, FormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) is a US-based provider of test and measurement technologies for semiconductors.\nWhy Do We Steer Clear of FORM?\n2.4% annual revenue growth over the last five years was slower than its semiconductor peers\nIncremental sales over the last five years were much less profitable as its earnings per share fell by 5.5% annually while its revenue grew\nWeak free cash flow margin of 3.7% has deteriorated further over the last five years as its investments increased\n\nStory Continues\nAt $55.75 per share, FormFactor trades at 39.7x forward P/E.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop Upgrades:\n\nKeefe Bruyette upgraded TeraWulf (WULF) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $24, up from $9.50. The firm believes investors are underestimating the magnitude of TeraWulf's bitcoin mining to high performance compute leasing mix shift in 2026 and 2027.\nClear Street upgraded Plug Power (PLUG) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $3, down from $3.50. The firm sees more attractive upside in the shares following the recent selloff. It cites dilution from Plug Power's convertible refinancing in late November for the target drop.\n\nTop Downgrades:\n\nWedbush downgraded GlobalFoundries (GFS) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $40, down from $42. While the firm believes that GlobalFoundries has a path to a model with stronger revenues, improved utilization, and better margins on improved end market fundamentals and a shift towards local supply chains, it also believes recent developments have elongated the timeframe around when those catalysts might play out, the firm tells investors.\nWedbush downgraded Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) to Neutral from Outperform with a $125 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade, noting that the stock is approaching the firm's target price and the 25-times multiple it uses to value Tower Semiconductor ostensibly already assumes some upside vs. its current estimates.\nTruist downgraded DigitalBridge (DBRG) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $16 following the announced all-cash acquisition by SoftBank Group (SFTBY) at $16 per share. The firm sees a low probability of a competing bid emerging.\nRaymond James double downgraded OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) to Market Perform from Strong Buy without a price target following the company's announcement to acquire Flushing Financial (FFIC) . The firm expects \"significant\" dilution and says the deal slows the benefit of OceanFirst's shift to a stronger core deposit franchise.\nRaymond James downgraded Flushing Financial (FFIC) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company agreed to be acquired by OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) . The deal was done at a fair price given the earnings challenges Flushing has faced due to the challenging rate environment for the past several years, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop Initiations:\n\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Serve Robotics (SERV) with a Buy rating and $16 price target. The firm believes Serve is positioned for \"strong growth and eventual profitability.\"\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of International Bancshares (IBOC) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. While the bank has elevated commercial real estate concentration, interest-rate sensitivity, and exposure to cross-border activity, the firm sees these factors being balanced by strong profitability supported by \"best-in-class\" efficiency and conservative balance sheet positioning.\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Butterfly Network (BFLY) with a Buy rating and $5 price target. The firm sees continued revenue expansion for Butterfly, driven by iQ3 probe and enterprise software adoption.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Analog Devices (ADI): Read This Before Placing a Bet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADI Check price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Analog Devices, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ADI Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $9.79.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Analog Devices may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights International Business Machines, Analog Devices, Johnson & Johnson's, The Gap and Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:14 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nJNJ\n\nHPE\n\nADI\n\nGAP\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI, Johnson & Johnson&rsquo;s JNJ, The Gap, Inc. GAP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop 5 High-Yield S&P 500 Stock to Buy for 2026\nThe U.S. stock market has experienced significant volatility at the beginning of 2025 owing to a multitude of factors. The trade policy framework undertaken in the new Trump administration has reshaped market sentiment. The aggressive tariff measures imposed by Washington on its major trading partners have left several businesses in a state of uncertainty. The growing Sino-U.S. trade tension was a concerning factor for investors. The U.S. government aims to limit Beijing&rsquo;s access to high-end technologies. It has imposed restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor tech to China.\nThe tariff-related uncertainties have significantly affected companies with a strong presence in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Moreover, the war in Europe and the Middle East has further aggravated the market uncertainty. These developments have led to rising manufacturing costs and supply chain issues, putting pressure on margins. However, there were some positive macroeconomic developments as well in 2025. The federal reserve rate cuts have lowered borrowing costs and improved corporate profitability.\n\nTrade-related risks and changes in monetary policy led to frequent stock price fluctuations. However, broader market momentum remained positive with tech stocks largely leading the bull run. Growing spending on AI infrastructure and digital transformation is driving growth in the tech sector. Despite a hike in energy prices, the overall annual inflation rate was lower than expected in 2025.\nKey Growth Drivers for 2026\nRapid AI buildouts are expected to be a key driver for businesses in 2026. Businesses in several industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, social ecommerce, telecom and others are rapidly incorporating AI across the portfolio to gain a competitive edge. However, this rapid AI build-out requires substantial computing infrastructure, data centers to support these AI workloads, as well as energy optimization and cooling technologies.\n\nLeer más\nAI integration has become capex-heavy. There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.\n\nChina is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government&rsquo;s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.\nAmid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.\n\nKey Picks\nInternational Business Machines Corp. : Headquartered in Armonk, NY, IBM is a leading provider of cloud and data platforms.

Do they waste a whole day trying to find the next big play in AI or do they just say, you know what? Nvidia's going to win this whole damn thing? I'm just going to bet on them again next year.\n00:15 Adam\nYeah, I definitely wouldn't uh just bet on Nvidia. I I think you do need to do your homework if you want to buy specific names. I think probably the general investor is probably better finding some sort of basket to kind of play the overall space. Uh but we're very early innings in this and\n00:41 Adam\nobviously Nvidia is the winner right now, but uh to say, you know, in five years that we look back that they're going to be the dominant player still, very, very unlikely. Like I said, this is really an evolving space. So I I would be careful with something that's so specific as Nvidia. Uh we kind of like to barbell this with, you know, something like the the big hyperscaler like a like an Alphabet Google, uh because that's really the type of name that uh you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because they just\n01:14 Adam\noverall, the AI story is just benefiting an already existing business model that was doing well. So, I think you would just want to be careful with what we're calling kind of the one trick ponies, like a Nvidia, uh a Core Weve or a Patier right now.\n01:31 Speaker A\nUh, Brooke, let me get over to you because I think what you're seeing in industrial metals and some of the things that Adam's talking about fits nicely with what we heard from Ed Yardini this morning that he might see it is likely to see we are likely to see a broadening out in this rally. Investors doing their homework, trying to get outside of the tried and true Mag 7.\n01:53 Brooke\nYeah, Brian, what we did hear from Ed Danny over the weekend was really ongoing momentum in this market in 2026. He maintained that year end target for the S&P 500 of 7,700 and he said largely it won't be really led by uh the Mag 7, but also what he called the impressive 493 of the S&P 500 as really this broadening out, this boost in productivity growth really leads to overall returns for the\n02:26 Brooke\nS&P 500 in 2026. Specifically, you know, he went on to say that that is really where exactly investors should be thinking about this mindset. You know, not really overweight technology, but more so thinking about the other users of AI as opposed to just the producers of AI. And so certainly he's not alone in this uh momentum that he thinks will exist within 2026 ongoing from what we've seen so far in the returns in 2025.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Is Using Debt Safely\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nDavid Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhen Is Debt A Problem? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Analog Devices Carry? The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at November 2025 Analog Devices had debt of US$8.60b, up from US$7.62b in one year. However, it also had US$3.65b in cash, and so its net debt is US$4.95b.\nHow Strong Is Analog Devices' Balance Sheet? According to the last reported balance sheet, Analog Devices had liabilities of US$3.25b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$10.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.65b in cash and US$1.44b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$9.09b.\n\nOf course, Analog Devices has a titanic market capitalization of US$135.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nStory Continues\nAnalog Devices's net debt is only 0.99 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 14.1 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, Analog Devices grew its EBIT by 45% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Analog Devices can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Analog Devices actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.\nOur View The good news is that Analog Devices's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. It looks Analog Devices has no trouble standing on its own two feet, and it has no reason to fear its lenders. For investing nerds like us its balance sheet is almost charming. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Analog Devices you should know about.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.
