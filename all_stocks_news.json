      "Content": "In recent days, Meta Platforms has outlined heavier spending on artificial intelligence, a planned cut of up to 30% in Metaverse investment, and the US$2.00 billion acquisition of AI agent startup Manus, while also facing fresh regulatory scrutiny over scam advertising practices in the US and Europe.\nThis mix of AI expansion, a shift back toward its core ad business, and rising compliance demands is reshaping how investors view Meta’s growth potential and risk profile.\nNext, we’ll examine how Meta’s decision to ramp up AI investment while trimming Metaverse spending could influence its existing investment narrative.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 29 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery . The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.\nMeta Platforms Investment Narrative Recap To own Meta today, you need to believe its AI heavy, ad centric model can keep compounding value even as regulation tightens and spending climbs. The most important short term catalyst is whether AI investments keep lifting engagement and ad yields enough to offset rising capital expenditure. The biggest current risk is regulatory pressure on scam advertising and identity checks, which could raise compliance costs and curb ad volumes; the recent headlines make that risk more immediate but not yet structurally different.\n\nThe Manus acquisition, at about US$2.0 billion, looks particularly relevant here because it extends Meta’s AI agent capabilities into commercial use cases that sit close to its core ad and business services. If Meta can integrate Manus across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, it could reinforce AI driven engagement and monetization at the same time that regulators are asking harder questions about how ads are targeted and verified.\nYet alongside Meta’s AI upside, investors should be aware of the growing regulatory push on scam ads and universal advertiser verification that could...\nRead the full narrative on Meta Platforms (it's free!)\nMeta Platforms' narrative projects $275.9 billion revenue and $92.1 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 15.6% yearly revenue growth and about a $20.6 billion earnings increase from $71.5 billion today.\n\nUncover how Meta Platforms' forecasts yield a $837.15 fair value , a 27% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Within the Simply Wall St Community, 101 private investors currently estimate Meta’s fair value between US$538 and US$1,053 per share, highlighting sharply different views on upside. Many of these investors focus on how quickly AI driven ad targeting and engagement improvements might translate into sustainable revenue growth, which could meaningfully influence Meta’s ability to absorb higher capital expenditure and regulatory costs over time.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 101 other fair value estimates on Meta Platforms - why the stock might be worth as much as 60% more than the current price!\nBuild Your Own Meta Platforms Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/bbf8034f-0e8b-31b1-a7ec-72cd29e62ea6/artificial-intelligence-%28ai%29.html",
      "Content": "^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points The AI revolution is responsible for one of the strongest three-year rallies in the S&P 500's history.\nNvidia and Palantir have become the faces of the rise of AI thanks to their sustainable moats.\nHowever, the actions of insiders are sending mixed signals for the stock market's premier AI stocks.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nFor only the third time in the S&P 500 's existence, Wall Street's benchmark index has rallied at least 15% for three consecutive years. These outsize returns for Wall Street from 2023 through 2025 come courtesy of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nEmpowering software and systems with the ability to make split-second decisions without the need for human oversight is a technological leap forward that can eventually add trillions to global gross domestic product (GDP). From a hardware and applications standpoint, no two AI stocks are leading the charge quite like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) .\nDuring Wall Street's three-year, AI-driven bull market, Nvidia has added more than $4.2 trillion in market value, while shares of Palantir have skyrocketed by more than 2,500%! They've arguably become the faces of the AI movement.\nBut while their respective growth rates would suggest a fourth year of jaw-dropping gains may be in the cards, the actions of those who know Nvidia and Palantir best point to a different outcome in the new year.\nNvidia and Palantir possess sustainable moats However, before making predictions about the future, it's important to understand how we got to the point where Nvidia and Palantir are, essentially, at or near the center of the AI universe on Wall Street.\nThe outperformance of both companies can be traced back to their well-defined sustainable moats.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred option as the brains of AI-accelerated data centers -- and it's not even close. By some analyst estimates, Nvidia's Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra chips account for 90% or more of the GPUs currently deployed in enterprise data centers.\nNo externally developed GPUs have come particularly close to matching the compute capacity of what Nvidia's GPUs bring to the table. Furthermore, CEO Jensen Huang has kept his company on an aggressive innovation timeline that'll see a new advanced chip introduced during the second-half of each year. Progressively faster and more efficient GPUs will make it virtually impossible for other chipmakers to go toe-to-toe with Nvidia in AI data centers.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's CUDA software platform has played a crucial role in its success, as well. This toolkit, which developers use to maximize the compute potential of their Nvidia GPUs, keeps clients loyal to the brand.\nMeanwhile, Palantir Technologies is an AI-applications business that lacks a one-for-one replacement at scale.\n\nPalantir's lead operating segment is Gotham, an AI-driven software-as-a-service platform that the U.S. government and its allies rely on for military mission planning and oversight, as well as data collection and analysis. Many of Palantir's government contracts span four or five years, leading to highly predictable operating cash flow and a sustainable (and transparent) double-digit growth rate.\nThe company's other core operating segment, Foundry, caters to businesses. Foundry is an AI- and machine learning-powered platform that helps companies understand their data to streamline their operations. As a newer platform, Foundry has the potential to deliver outsize sales growth throughout the decade.\nWall Street and investors have demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium for public companies with sustainable moats.\nThe people who know Nvidia and Palantir best have a $3.3 billion warning for Wall Street in 2026 However, things don't always go the way that investors expect in the stock market. The actions of Nvidia's and Palantir's insiders in 2025 certainly raise some potential red flags for the new year.\nAn \"insider\" is a high-ranking company executive, member of the board of directors, or beneficial shareholder who may possess non-public information. For the sake of transparency and to follow all securities laws, insiders are required to file Form 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission within two business days of buying or selling their company's stock.\n\nBased on Form 4 filings in 2025, insiders at Nvidia and Palantir were decisive net sellers of their respective shares:\nNvidia : $2,164,822,949 in net selling activity\nPalantir : $1,146,687,533 in net selling activity\nCollectively, more than $3.3 billion worth of Wall Street's hottest AI stocks were sold by insiders last year.\nThe asterisk that should be placed next to the aforementioned figure is that not all insider selling is necessarily bad news for investors. Since most executives and board members are compensated in the form of shares or stock options, they'll often sell a portion of their shares or exercise their options and subsequently sell the shares to cover their federal and/or state income tax liability. Tax-based selling isn't something Wall Street or investors should worry too much about.\n\nAt the same time, insider buying has been almost nonexistent for both companies. The last time an Nvidia executive or board member bought shares was over five years ago, in December 2020. Meanwhile, only one executive/board member at Palantir purchased shares last year.\nAlthough several reasons exist to sell a stock, not all of which are nefarious, the only reason an insider would buy shares is if they believe the stock will head higher. The persistent lack of insider buying that we've observed with Nvidia and Palantir speaks volumes.\nAs we push ahead into 2026, keep in mind that no next-big-thing technology trend, for more than three decades, has avoided an early innings bubble-bursting event. While AI has been Wall Street's hottest trend for three years (and counting), AI isn't anywhere close to being a mature technology.\n\nFurthermore, history has shown that price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 for companies heralding the charge of a game-changing innovation aren't sustainable over long periods. Nvidia's P/S ratio briefly topped 30 in early November, while Palantir's P/S ratio is currently tipping the scales at 110!\nThe lack of insider buying, coupled with billions of dollars in annual insider selling, would appear to signal that neither Nvidia nor Palantir shares are attractive.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Title": "A Look At Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Valuation After CES 2026 AI And Data Center Announcements",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-advanced-micro-devices-amd-091020341.html",
      "Content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is back in the spotlight after its CES 2026 keynote, where CEO Lisa Su introduced new AI data center GPUs, the Helios rack platform, and Ryzen AI chips for PCs and embedded systems.\nSee our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices.\nThose CES 2026 launches come after a period of mixed share price moves, with a 7 day share price return of 2.67% and a 90 day share price decline of 6.15%, yet a 1 year total shareholder return of 73.63% and a 3 year total shareholder return above 3x, indicating that longer term momentum has remained strong even as short term sentiment has cooled.\n\nIf AMD's AI push has your attention, this can be a good moment to scan other chip names riding similar themes through high growth tech and AI stocks and see what else stands out.\nWith AMD now trading at US$221.08, sitting at a roughly 32% intrinsic discount and about 28% below the average analyst target, you have to ask yourself whether this is a fresh entry point or whether the market is already baking in future growth.\nMost Popular Narrative: 18.1% Undervalued According to oscargarcia, the narrative points to a fair value of about US$270 per share, compared with AMD's last close at US$221.08, framing the stock as materially below that estimate.\nRead the complete narrative.\nWant to see what underpins that higher fair value line? The narrative leans heavily on faster revenue expansion, richer margins, and a profit multiple usually linked with top tier AI names. Curious which specific assumptions power that model through 2030 and how they tie back to data center demand and AI racks rather than PCs alone? The full breakdown lays out those moving parts in detail.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $270 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, there are still clear pressure points, including Nvidia's lead in high end AI GPUs and export controls that could affect margins and slow AI chip demand.\nFind out about the key risks to this Advanced Micro Devices narrative.\nAnother Way To Look At AMD's Valuation Our DCF model identifies AMD as undervalued, with the current price of US$221.08 sitting about 31.9% below an estimated fair value of US$324.80. This supports the view that the stock may be underpriced, but it also raises a question: are the long term growth and margin assumptions here too optimistic, or are they about right for you?\n\nStory Continues\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nBuild Your Own Advanced Micro Devices Narrative If you look at the numbers and reach a different conclusion, or simply prefer to test your own assumptions, you can build a personalised AMD view in just a few minutes with Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Advanced Micro Devices research is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards and 1 important warning sign that could impact your investment decision.\n\nLooking for more investment ideas? If AMD has sharpened your interest in AI and high growth themes, you do not have to stop here. You can widen your watchlist with targeted stock ideas.\nSpot potential high growth names early by scanning these 3554 penny stocks with strong financials that already show stronger balance sheets and fundamentals than many peers.\nZero in on AI focused businesses by checking these 25 AI penny stocks that are tied directly to machine learning, data processing, and automation themes.\nHunt for possible mispriced opportunities using these 879 undervalued stocks based on cash flows where current prices sit below cash flow based estimates.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Speaking at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, she showcased the company's latest AI hardware and held up new chips for the crowd to see. \"MI455 is the most advanced chip we've ever built. It's pretty darn big. It has 320 billion transistors, 70% more than MI355.\" These chips power data‑center racks that AMD sells to firms like OpenAI. The president of the ChatGPT-maker, Greg Brockman, joined Su on stage. He said chip advances were vital to OpenAI's vast needs for computing power. Su also had big claims for another platform: \"So let me tell you what it is. This is the smallest AI development system in the world, capable of running models with up to 200 billion parameters locally not connected to anything.\" AMD remains Nvidia's top rival in AI chips, but trails in market share. A recent deal with OpenAI has been seen as a show of confidence in the company. :: NVIDIA But analysts say it's unlikely to dent the dominance of Nvidia, which showed off its own new chips the same day.

      "Content": "^GSPC\n\nKey Points Nvidia holds a dominant share of the data center GPU market.\nThe company's extensive library of developer tools provides a powerful competitive advantage.\nNvidia is pricey by some metrics, but isn't as expensive as it appears.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nLast year was something of a roller-coaster ride for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. The stock continued the bull run that began back in early 2023 when the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for running artificial intelligence (AI) applications in data centers. Despite fears of rising competition, Nvidia closed out 2025 in strong fashion, gaining 39% for the year, more than twice the 16% increase for the S&P 500 .\nHowever, investors are looking to the future and asking the quintessential investing question. In the wake of the company's strong performance in recent years, is it too late to buy Nvidia stock as we head into 2026? Let's examine the available evidence to see what it reveals.\nA position of strength Nvidia continues to operate from a position of strength, despite encroaching competition (more on that in a bit). CEO Jensen Huang recognized the increasing potential of AI as early as 2013 and positioned the company to capitalize on the wave of AI adoption, paving the way for future success.\nDon't take my word for it. Nvidia dominates the data center GPU market with a 92% share, according to IoT Analytics. Furthermore, the company adopted an annual product development and release cadence that makes it extremely difficult for competitors to gain ground.\n\nTactical advantage -- Nvidia There's been a lot of talk about the increasing competition in the AI space, and that certainly appears to have some merit.\nWhile Amazon has been developing its own homegrown AI processors for years, the company recently launched its Trainium 3 chip, which Amazon claims is 4 times faster, boasts 4 times more memory, and is 40% more energy-efficient than its predecessor.\n\nAlphabet 's Google debuted its first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in 2015 and released the seventh-generation Ironwood TPU late last year. The company notes that the latest version offers peak performance 10 times that of the fifth version and 4 times the improvement compared to version six.\nAdvanced Micro Devices -- Nvidia's most oft-cited rival -- released its MI350 processors last year, which offer 4 times better performance than the prior version. Furthermore, the company's MI400 series of rack-scale processors, which are due out this year, is being touted as the best yet for AMD.\n\nStory Continues\nYet Nvidia maintains a competitive moat that was years in the making. The company's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is an extensive library of software tools that help developers get the best performance out of Nvidia's GPUs. CUDA is widely acknowledged as the gold standard for GPU programming and is used by more than 4.5 million developers, creating a powerful network effect and a unique competitive advantage that will keep its rivals at bay for years to come.\n\nIs Nvidia overvalued? Some investors would argue that Nvidia stock is pricey, and that view is certainly understandable, given the stock currently trades for 46 times earnings. However, taking a step back suggests that view is also myopic.\nNvidia has risen 1,200% over the past three years, and growth of that magnitude shows why the stock is deserving of a premium. Additionally, the most commonly used valuation metrics struggle to value high-growth stocks. The more appropriate price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio returns a multiple of 0.78 -- when any number less than 1 is the standard for an undervalued stock. Furthermore, the stock is trading for a much more reasonable multiple of 25 times next year's earnings.\n\nIts growth streak is expected to continue. For its fiscal 2026 (which ends in late January), Nvidia is on track to increase revenue by 63% and earnings per share (EPS) by 59% -- despite heavy investment in the next generation of AI-centric processors. Furthermore, Wall Street expects the company to grow its revenue by 50% in fiscal 2027.\nTaken together, Nvidia's strong competitive position, proven track record, and robust growth prospects suggest that the stock remains a buy heading into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】全球科技盛會 CES 2026 隆重開幕，超微（AMD）執行長蘇姿丰發表主題演講，圍繞AI 革命，AMD端出重量級武器-MI 450及Helios機櫃 。面對生成式 AI 帶來的運算缺口，蘇姿丰展現強大的技術野心，特別是在與晶圓代工龍頭台積電（2330）的深度戰略合作上，透過導入台積電 2 奈米製程與次世代 3D Chiplet（小晶片）技術，全面推動 AI 效能翻倍增長。\n\n蘇姿丰直言，AI 正快速從工具進化為基礎建設，全球算力需求未來五年將從目前的 Zetta 等級，推升至 10 YottaFLOPS，運算規模較 2022 年暴增一萬倍，這樣的跨世代跳躍，背後仰賴的不只是系統架構創新，更取決於製程技術的極限突破。\n\n首度公開展示代號 Venice 的新世代 EPYC 伺服器處理器，蘇姿丰宣布，AMD正式邁入 2 奈米製程世代，Venice 採用最新 Zen 6 架構，單顆處理器最高整合 256 顆核心，並將記憶體與 GPU 頻寬較前代倍增，鎖定 AI 訓練與推論的極致效能需求。據悉，AMD 早已預約台積電 2 奈米產能，而Venice CPU為首款採用台積電 2 奈米製程之HPC產品、於去年4月完成投片（tape out）；正式端出2奈米CPU晶片，以製程領先與輝達正面對決。不僅 CPU，AMD 同步發表新一代 AI 加速器 Instinct MI 455X，這顆被蘇姿丰形容為「AMD 有史以來最先進晶片」，整合 2 奈米與 3 奈米運算與 I/O chiplet，並搭載 HBM4 高頻寬記憶體與最新 3D 堆疊封裝技術，單顆晶片電晶體數達 3,200 億顆。\n\n在先進封裝方面，MI 455 採用多晶粒 3D 堆疊與高密度互連設計，業界認為，這正是台積電 SoIC 與 CoWoS 技術路線在 AI 加速器世代的延伸實戰版，也代表台積電不僅在製程節點領先，更同步掌握 AI 時代的關鍵封裝話語權。\n\n蘇姿丰同步揭示 AMD 專為 AI 超大規模資料中心打造的 Helios 機櫃級平台，每座機櫃整合 MI-455 GPU、Venice CPU 與 Pensando 網通晶片，透過高速乙太網與超加速器互連協定，讓 72 顆 GPU 如同單一運算單元運作。單一機櫃即可提供高達 2.9 ExaFLOPS 的 AI 運算效能。（新聞來源：工商即時 張珈睿）",

      "Content": "Sony-Honda JV Unveils AFEELA Prototype 2026, Targets U.S. Launch by 2028\n\nCharles Kennedy\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 9:21 PM PST 4 min read\n\nSony Honda Mobility on Monday unveiled the AFEELA Prototype 2026 at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, marking the latest step in the joint venture&rsquo;s effort to blend electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and digital entertainment into a new mobility platform.\nThe prototype, which builds on the AFEELA 1 pre-production model, is intended as the basis for a second production vehicle expected to launch in the U.S. market as early as 2028. SHM reiterated that customer deliveries of AFEELA 1 in California are scheduled to begin in 2026, with an expansion to Arizona planned for 2027.\n\nThe announcements underscore the ambition of Sony Group and Honda Motor to position their mobility venture at the intersection of automotive manufacturing, software-defined vehicles, and entertainment ecosystems&mdash;an increasingly competitive space as automakers and technology firms race to define the next generation of electric and autonomous vehicles.\nAFEELA 1, first revealed as a concept at CES 2023, is now entering its commercialization phase. SHM said reservations opened in California in January 2025, drawing more than 100,000 visitors to AFEELA Studio showrooms and generating over 24,000 in-vehicle demonstrations during the first year.\nTrial production runs were completed in late 2025 at Honda&rsquo;s East Liberty Auto Plant in Ohio, where the vehicle will be contract-manufactured. Pre-production units were showcased at CES 2026, signaling readiness for scaled manufacturing.\n\nTo support deliveries and customer engagement, SHM plans to open combined showroom and delivery hubs in Torrance and Fremont, California, this spring. Early reservation holders will be offered a phased experiential program, including demo drives later this year.\nAt the center of SHM&rsquo;s strategy is its concept of &ldquo;Mobility as a Creative Entertainment Space.&rdquo; The company envisions vehicles evolving from driver-focused machines into AI-enabled environments that use time spent in transit for entertainment, interaction, and productivity.\nKey to that vision is AFEELA Intelligent Drive, SHM&rsquo;s advanced driver assistance system. The company said it is evolving the system toward an end-to-end AI model incorporating vision-language technologies, beginning with Level 2+ driver assistance and ultimately targeting Level 4&ndash;equivalent capabilities.\nSHM also confirmed it will adopt Qualcomm Technologies&rsquo; Snapdragon Digital Chassis in its next-generation electrical and electronic architecture, aligning with a broader industry shift toward centralized computing platforms and software-defined vehicles.\n\nStory Continues\nIn parallel, the AFEELA Personal Agent&mdash;powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service&mdash;is designed to act as a conversational interface that adapts to individual users, reinforcing Sony&rsquo;s long-standing strengths in interactive entertainment and content.\nBeyond hardware, SHM is pushing to build an open developer ecosystem. The newly announced AFEELA Co-Creation Program will provide creators with access to development documentation and tools for in-vehicle entertainment, including Android-based infotainment applications.\n\nMore controversially, SHM also outlined plans for an on-chain mobility service platform using a token-based incentive model. The proposed &ldquo;X-to-Earn&rdquo; framework would support ideation, development, and user evaluation of mobility services, and could be opened to other automakers and service providers.\nWhile still conceptual, the move reflects growing experimentation across the auto and tech sectors with digital ecosystems, data monetization, and user engagement models beyond traditional vehicle sales.\nSony Honda Mobility was formed in 2022 as the partners sought to combine Honda&rsquo;s manufacturing scale and safety expertise with Sony&rsquo;s capabilities in sensors, software, gaming, and media. The venture faces competition from Tesla, legacy automakers accelerating their EV and ADAS programs, and new entrants emphasizing software-first vehicle design.\n\nWith AFEELA 1 nearing initial deliveries and a second model already mapped out, SHM is signaling that it intends to be a long-term player in the global EV and autonomous mobility race rather than a one-off technology showcase.\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nTop Chinese Offshore Gas Field Ships 100th Oil Cargo\nCoal Remains King in India While Exports Optimize Domestic Stock\nIndia to Leverage Russian Oil Import Data in Trade Deal Negotiations\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

      "Content": "CRWV\n\nAt CES 2026, NVIDIA unveiled its next-generation Rubin AI platform, six tightly integrated chips led by the Vera CPU and Rubin GPU, now in full production and slated for broad deployment by major cloud providers and AI labs from the second half of 2026.\nBy pairing Rubin with ecosystem moves such as Red Hat’s Day 0 support, CoreWeave’s planned Rubin roll-out, and new BlueField-4-based context memory and robotics and autonomous driving stacks, NVIDIA is pushing AI toward rack-scale “AI factories” spanning data centers, vehicles, and physical robots.\nWe'll now examine how Rubin’s rack-scale, full-stack AI design and ecosystem adoption could reshape NVIDIA's existing investment narrative.\n\nUncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward .\nNVIDIA Investment Narrative Recap To own NVIDIA, you have to believe that AI infrastructure spending remains robust enough for the company to monetize its full stack Rubin “AI factory” roadmap, while it manages mounting competition and regulatory scrutiny. The CES 2026 Rubin launch supports the near term catalyst of hyperscaler and AI lab deployments from the second half of 2026, while the biggest current risk is that hyperscalers’ in house chips and any slowdown in AI capex could erode that demand.\n\nAmong the recent announcements, Red Hat’s Day 0 support for the Rubin platform looks especially relevant, because it reinforces Rubin as an enterprise grade standard across hybrid cloud, not just a new GPU. If Rubin based racks ship into major clouds as planned, this Red Hat integration could help sustain NVIDIA’s AI data center narrative even if individual customers push harder on custom silicon.\nYet behind the Rubin excitement, investors should also be aware that concentrated hyperscaler demand and their own custom chip efforts could...\nRead the full narrative on NVIDIA (it's free!)\nNVIDIA's narrative projects $337.2 billion revenue and $187.9 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how NVIDIA's forecasts yield a $253.02 fair value , a 34% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives Four hundred fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$104 to US$341.

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nAMD ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su unveiled the company's upcoming AI data center platform during her keynote at CES 2026 in Las Vegas on Monday, providing a first look at the Helios system and offering more details about how it will be built.\nSu not only brought out a large Helios rack unit on stage, but also said it was the \"world's best AI rack,\" a direct shot across Nvidia's bow.\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) has set the standard for rack scale systems and debuted its latest offering, the Vera Rubin NVL72, at CES on Monday .\nHelios will go head-to-head with Nvidia’s own NVL systems, matching its latest NVL72’s 72 Rubin GPUs with 72 of AMD’s MI455X chips. It’s another sign that AMD is working to move further in on Nvidia’s turf in the AI data center market.\nThe company expanded on that effort by providing more information about its upcoming MI500 series data center GPUs, which AMD boldly declares will provide up to a 1,000x increase in AI performance compared to its MI300X GPUs.\nAccording to Su, that kind of performance jump will be necessary over the coming years. During her keynote, the CEO said AMD believes some 5 billion people will be using AI every day in the next 5 years, and to meet that demand, technology companies will need to increase global computing capacity by 100 times in the coming years.\nThat kind of growth could undoubtedly benefit AMD and Nvidia.\nAMD has benefited handsomely from both its AI data center businesses over the last year. The company’s stock price increased 76% over the last 12 months, outpacing even that of Nvidia, which rose 30%.\n\nStill, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI industry, increasing its market capitalization to $4.5 trillion. AMD’s market cap sits at $359 billion.\nLike Nvidia and Intel ( INTC ), AMD also showcased its work in the robotics space, with Su bringing Generative Bionics CEO Daniele Pucci on stage to unveil the company’s humanoid robot for the first time.\n\nPowered by AMD’s CPUs and GPUs, the robot, dubbed GENE.01, is meant to operate in industrial environments. AMD is an investor in Generative Bionics.\nOn the PC front, Su announced that AMD's latest Ryzen AI 400 Series and Ryzen AI Pro 400 series chips will take on Intel’s new Core Ultra 3 processors built on its new 18A process technology.\nAccording to AMD, the chips come with up to 12 high-performance CPU cores for consumers that need oodles of processing power, as well as AMD’s integrated Radeon 800M series graphics chips, and an NPU with up to 60 TOPs of performance. TOPs, or trillions of operations per second, are a means for measuring AI processing performance.\n\nStory Continues\nAll of that, the company says, means users can expect multi-day battery life and strong AI and gaming capabilities.\nThe company also showed off its latest Ryzen AI Max+ chips for premium light laptops, workstations, and mini-PCs, as well as its new Ryzen AI Halo developer platform. Essentially a mini desktop PC, the computer is designed to help developers build AI models locally rather than in the cloud.\nThe Halo developer platform goes up against Nvidia’s rival DGX Spark mini-PC, which costs $3,999. AMD didn’t reveal pricing for Halo.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) founder handed the keys to Andy Jassy , a longtime insider whose leadership philosophy was shaped long before boardrooms — by lessons from his father.\nFrom Early Amazon Employee To Bezos' Chosen Successor Jassy became Amazon's second CEO in July 2021, marking a rare leadership transition at one of the world's most powerful companies.\nJassy joined Amazon in 1997 — the same year it went public — and spent decades rising through the ranks before founding Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006.\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nAWS would become Amazon's most profitable engine and by the time Jassy stepped down as its CEO in 2021, the cloud unit had grown into a roughly $40 billion annual business.\nThat track record made him Bezos's clear choice to lead the $2.49 trillion e-commerce and cloud giant.\nThe Childhood Lessons That Still Guide Amazon's CEO In a 2022 Amazon-hosted fireside chat, Jassy said his biggest influence growing up wasn't a business leader — it was his father.\nJassy described his dad as a thoughtful, humble and hardworking man who quietly taught him accountability and discipline.\nOne lesson stuck from watching his father carefully sign checks and receipts. When Jassy asked why he took so much time, his father told him never to assume he was too important for others to read his name — a reminder, Jassy said, that no one is above accountability.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAnother moment came at a childhood soccer game, when Jassy's father challenged him to run a mile. After finishing slowly and proudly declaring success, Jassy recalled his father responding bluntly: If you're going to do something halfway, don't do it at all.\n\"He doesn’t remember saying that either, but it always stuck with me that if you’re gonna do something, do it right or don’t do it. And so he just was a great role model my whole life,\" Jassy said, explaining that those lessons still play like \"tapes\" in the back of his mind when he makes decisions today.\nInside Andy Jassy's First-Year CEO Pay Package Amazon disclosed that Jassy earned $212.7 million in total compensation in 2021, his first year as CEO. Nearly all of it came from restricted stock that vests over 10 years, designed to incentivize long-term performance. His base salary remained $175,000.\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nJassy officially took over on July 5, 2021, coinciding with the 27th anniversary of the company's incorporation.\nAmazon shares closed at an adjusted $159.90 on July 7, 2021, and were trading at $232.53 as of Tuesday's close, marking a roughly 45% gain since Jassy assumed leadership.\n\nRead Next: Missed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs?

      "Content": "台股上3萬點，被問到房市是否會被帶動？房市投資比不上股票市場！「房產總司令」戴德梁行顏炳立今（6）日在一場記者會前受訪表示，台積電漲80元需要千億資金，房市不像股市有高流動性，資金找熱標的，錢已離開，房市馬上熱機率不大，未來二年找低價「是不可能的任務」並不適合投資。他認為今年房市馬不奔，「價要先降，量才會出來」，房價蛋黃區估只會修正5%上下，雙北外房價頂多降一成「蛋白區冷過蛋黃區」，預售屋降價機率不高。\n\n戴德梁行上午舉2025 年度房地產市場回顧及2026年趨勢預測，顏炳立看好工業用地持續翻轉向上，他說，限貸令下市場仍有量，主要因為科技設廠，因此企業主、科技業仍在購地，工業土地是「一個人的武林」，持續增長，也讓六都工業土地出現翻商。\n\n至於商用市場緩下來，也受預售市場不好所致，他估今年土地市場交易健康約在1600億元、商用土地約在1400億元規模，收益率不高下，法人想要買高報酬不動產量也縮手。\n\n他說，2025年底來看房市「買氣斷量縮，價沒動」，去年量被血洗後並沒有失溫，全年估約26萬棟左右，仍高於2016年史上最 的24.5萬棟，顯示民間購買力仍興旺，但沒有投機客進來，因此房市良性健康，展望2026年，他認為成交量維持約26萬棟的溫和穩下來。\n\n「2026價要先降量才會出來，房市也才會生信心」。顏炳立說，雙北除非很偏僻或房價過高、商品本身有問題，價格會比較平穩，蛋黃區估只會修正5%上下；至於雙北以外房價被熱炒上來的應該要做一些修正，幅度也不大約在10%以內。建商開新案持穩下來，除非土地取得較早，才有讓利的空間，因此「預售屋要降價的機率不大」。\n\n今年房市成交量要增加，顏炳立建議央行要鬆綁對第二戶的控管，他說央行打壓的掌控與打目標都已達標，「民眾對房價上漲的期待已經沒有了」，而且房市也冷了、量也縮了，三是價格要下來需要時間，經一整年洗禮後，沒有太多小建商「從點變線」造成大災難，銀行逾放很低、建商資金管控也佳，房屋淪落法拍也很快被買走。因此他認為明年房市「量」很溫和不失溫，價向下幅度有限，但展望仍樂觀。\n\n至於台股上3萬點，他提及市場資金轉動速度快，資金不只從比特幣、黃金、白銀、銅，又回到股票市場，資金在追逐有利獲利非常積極，過去從一年都是從台積電開始，只要漲個25元，指數漲2、3百點，投資人信心就回來。他說，昨天台積電漲80元需要千億元資金，民間資金幾兆元相當熱絡，房市受人為政策管制所影響，並不是銀行內真的沒錢，他說2024年當時房市高達35萬棟，難道都是剛性需求？政府提供很低成本的資金及負擔，2024年是很明顯的炒作，他說，看房市是不是炒作？只要看房價「蛋殼區賣蛋白價、蛋白賣蛋黃價」，他說這不是炒作是什麼呢？資金熱到把銀行法72之2條的房貸都貸光了，今明年完工仍撐得住，代表資金是很高的。\n\n但是去年從35萬棟縮到26萬棟，他認為房市不像股市擁有高流動性，不認為未來二年適合投資房地產，股市買錯一、二天就出來了，房市交割至少一個月等，沒那麼多接盤俠，剛性需求都是找合理價，投資要找低價「是不可能的任務」，因此量很快縮掉，多餘資金追逐熱的標的，「房市馬上要熱起來機率不大」。",

      "Content": "Key Points This ETF has an interesting history as it was born as a software fund.\nNow it resides at the high-growth intersection of AI and software.\nIt doesn’t command the same amount of attention as other AI ETFs, but that anonymity belies opportunity.\n10 stocks we like better than Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF ›\n\nAsking any fund to behave like a story stock, let alone one with an epic tale such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , is a tall order. After all, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of stocks, so even when those products hold shares of a darling like Nvidia, returns are determined by the entire roster, not a single name.\nIt's a trade-off. Investors sacrifice some of the upside potential of an individual stock for the diversification benefits and removal of the stock-picking burden associated with ETFs and index funds . That doesn't mean the ETF landscape is lacking funds with multibagger potential -- not when there are so many dedicated tech and artificial intelligence (AI) ETFs on the market.\nTake the case of the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF (NYSEMKT: IGPT) . This ETF, which counts Nvidia as its second-largest holding, may not be \"the next Nvidia.\" Still, it has the ingredients needed to deliver sizable long-term gains, perhaps even those of the triple-digit variety. Below, I'll examine the bull case for this AI ETF.\n\nThe leopard changed its spots -- AI software matters This Invesco ETF has $652 million in assets under management (AUM) and turned 20 years old in June, so it's neither small, nor young. What's interesting is that this fund was conceived as a software-focused ETF, but amid the AI groundswell, the issuer changed the name and index in June 2023 to better reflect its AI-centric positioning.\n\nBetween 2024 and 2025, Nvidia outpaced the AI ETF by a margin of better than 5-to-1; however, to the fund's credit, it slightly outpaced the Nasdaq-100 over that time frame. Remember that the aim of an ETF isn't to top its best-performing components. Instead, it's to provide a combination of diversification and upside potential. This Invesco ETF, which charges an annual fee of 0.56%, holds 100 stocks across 17 industries.\nToday, this tech ETF allocates more than 43% of its portfolio to semiconductor stocks, while also providing significant exposure to AI hyperscalers . It also retains some of its software roots, which is important because some experts believe specific software names are among the top AI ideas for long-term investors.\n\nA prime example of the AI/software intersection is Adobe , which is a top 10 holding in this ETF. The company behind Illustrator and Photoshop is well-known to many tech investors and is also developing AI-related products. When Adobe delivered fiscal fourth-quarter results in December, CEO Shantanu Narayen highlighted the company's \"growing importance in the global AI ecosystem and the rapid adoption of our AI-driven tools.\"\n\nStory Continues\nAnother company situated at the intersection of AI and software that could drive this tech ETF to significant gains is Snowflake . A standout tech name with the potential to beat more popular stocks in 2026, Snowflake is leveraging AI tools to retain current clients and attract new ones.\nIts AI-powered Cortex platform allows customers to build apps using the data they're already paying Snowflake to store and secure. This confirms it has multiple avenues for expanding relationships with existing clients while garnering new business.\n\nNot Nvidia -- and it doesn't need to be There are times when investors can benefit from a reality check, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Here it is regarding this AI ETF: It probably won't generate Nvidia-like returns. Few assets ever will, but that's not a knock on this fund because it has the potential to deliver performances that will please even the most discerning investors.\n\nThe growth tailwinds are there. Goldman Sachs estimates the market for AI-powered customer service software could expand by 20% to 45% by 2030. The high end of the range implies growth that's more than double the forecast for the broader software industry.\nAgentic AI progress could also benefit this ETF because its software holdings can present clients with fresh innovations that bring workplace productivity enhancements. Additionally, software developers, including some based in this ETF, are working on addressing issues that hinder AI software adoption. As those strides are made, more tailwinds for this fund could emerge.\nAt the end of the day, this AI ETF is unlikely to match Nvidia's long-term return profile. However, that's not all that negative because the fundamental factors are in place for this fund to deliver triple-digit gains over extended holding periods.\n\nShould you buy stock in Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF right now?

      "Content": "Samsung begins its CES 2026 Tech Forums by convening leaders in smart home interoperability for an industry-defining discussion\nLAS VEGAS , Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today convened leaders across industries in to discuss the importance of smart home interoperability in the first of its Tech Forum panels at CES 2026 at The Wynn in Las Vegas, Nevada. In the session, titled \"When Everything Clicks: How Open Ecosystems Deliver Impactful AI,\" experts discussed how cross-industry partnerships are transforming connected homes into intelligent environments that feel seamless, safe and genuinely supportive of people's lives.\n\nOpenness as the Foundation of Home AI\nThe panelists agreed that the next era of home intelligence must be built on open collaboration, not closed ecosystems. As homes increasingly rely on devices and services from many brands and industries, openness enables AI systems to work together in ways that create real-world impact. Samsung shared its belief that open connectivity allows appliances, energy systems, safety services and partners across industries to deliver experiences that would be impossible in siloed environments.\n\n\"Home is the most personal place in our lives, so home AI must earn trust — quietly, respectfully, and with value users can feel,\" said Yoonho Choi, President & Chair of the Board of the Home Connectivity Alliance and Head of Strategic Alliances at Samsung Electronics. \"That requires interoperability across brands, so the home works as one system instead of disconnected features. Through cooperation with HCA and across industries, we're turning openness into outcomes: safer homes, simpler routines and measurable savings — built on consent and transparency.\"\nPowering the World's Largest Connected Home Ecosystem\nSamsung highlighted the scale and depth of its connected ecosystem, noting that more than 500 million users are already part of the SmartThings community. With over a decade of leadership in connected living, Samsung brings deep insight into how AI companionship in the home is evolving, from today's smart devices to tomorrow's system-wide intelligence.\n\nThis foundation allows Samsung to design AI experiences that coordinate across appliances and services, delivering value that feels natural rather than technical.\n\"It's crucial to deliver tangible user benefits that make people's lives better,\" said Michael Wolf, founder and editor-in-chief of The Spoon. \"Along these lines, there's no area that will bring more benefit than a broadly connected kitchen — one that that allows users to understand what's in their refrigerator while connecting to the water and heating networks, allowing for a more holistic understanding that takes preventative action.\"\n\nStory Continues\nTurning Collaboration Into Measurable Consumer Benefits\nThe panel also examined how open ecosystems enable measurable benefits for consumers through cross-industry partnerships. Samsung highlighted its collaboration with Hartford Steam Boiler (HSB) as a first-of-its-kind example of how smart home data — used responsibly and transparently — can deliver meaningful outcomes.\n\n\"We're at a point where the connected home can bring seamless integration into user lifestyles, which begins to develop trust in smart home equipment that results in direct benefits to consumers,\" said Jed Usich, Senior Vice President of Strategic Growth Solutions at HSB. \"Through our partnership with Samsung, we've created a bridge to the insurance industry that takes simple datapoints and turns them into tangible savings for consumers.\"\nDesigning AI That Feels Human, Not Intrusive\nThroughout the discussion, the panelists emphasized that for home AI to succeed, it must feel emotionally intelligent and fit naturally into routines including cooking, relaxing, entertaining and caring for families. Design, storytelling and behavioral understanding all play a role in making connected devices feel like calm, reliable companions.\n\nTogether, the panelists agreed that the future of home AI depends on interoperability, responsible data use and collaboration across industries, ensuring intelligent homes deliver real value without compromising trust.\nAs AI becomes more ambient and system-wide, Samsung remains focused on building open ecosystems that make connected living simpler, safer and more meaningful, proving that when everything clicks, home AI can truly improve everyday life.\nAbout Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nSamsung inspires the world and shapes the future with transformative ideas and technologies. The company is redefining the worlds of TVs, digital signage, smartphones, wearables, tablets, home appliances and network systems, as well as memory, system LSI and foundry. Samsung is also advancing medical imaging technologies, HVAC solutions and robotics, while creating innovative automotive and audio products through Harman.

      "Content": "MSFT\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL ) is included among the 13 Best January Dividend Stocks to Invest in .\nOn January 5, Melius Research upgraded Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) to Buy from Hold and set a $135 price target. The analyst noted that the stock is down about 11% from its recent intraday high. From their perspective, Marvell’s backlog in custom silicon continues to build. Revenue from this segment is expected to double in calendar year 2027, driven by Microsoft’s MAIA chip and the ramp of several XPU-attach sockets. The analyst also pointed out that Microsoft’s internal silicon design capabilities still lag those of AWS’s Annapurna Labs. That gap could leave room for a larger share of profits to flow to external custom silicon providers such as Marvell Technology.\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) has been benefiting from fast-growing demand for AI-focused application-specific integrated circuits used in data centers. These ASICs are designed to handle AI workloads more efficiently, offering higher speeds and better power efficiency than general-purpose chips like GPUs.\nAs a result, hyperscalers and AI-focused companies are increasingly turning to ASIC designers to build in-house chips. Demand has picked up sharply. According to TrendForce, ASIC shipments are expected to grow 45% in 2026, compared with an estimated 16% increase in GPU shipments. That trend places Marvell in a strong position going into 2026. The company counts major customers such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft among its client base.\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), along with its subsidiaries, supplies data infrastructure semiconductor solutions across the data center core and out to the network edge.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "【時報記者郭鴻慧台北報導】美股四大指數昨夜同步收紅，但輝達、美光等晶片巨頭回檔，牽動台股今早走勢轉趨震盪。儘管台積電ADR仍小漲0.83%，台積電（2330）今早卻開低25元、以1,645元開出，拖累集中市場指數開盤下跌171.39點、報29,933.65點，一度跌破三萬點心理關卡。\n\n不過，盤面隨即湧現撐盤力道。鴻海受惠2025年營收正式突破8兆元大關，多頭買盤進場點火，股價轉強走高；同時，DRAM市況回溫題材延燒，南亞科(2408)、華邦電(2344)領軍記憶體族群續強演出，日月光投控(3711)股價再創新高；另外，矽晶圓的合晶(6182)、環球晶(6488)等雙雙鎖在漲停板；長興(1717)漲停板開開關關；神隆(1789)多發性硬化症新藥，下季將賣向美國，股價鎖在漲停板18.8元；面板股大噴發，彩晶(6116)、友達(2409)強鎖漲停，群創(3481)漲幅在9%以上，成功提振市場信心。\n\n分析師指出，在權值股與電子族群輪番表態下，加權指數迅速收復三萬點整數關卡，盤中多空拉鋸明顯，短線指數進入高檔震盪、激戰格局。\n\n台股在AI需求爆發、台積電領軍下，加權指數順利衝破三萬大關，後續該如何觀察？中國信託台灣活力基金經理人徐啟葳表示，全球大型雲端服務供應商（Cloud Service Provider）資本支出年增率持續強勁，巨大的資本支出代表AI著算力處於供不應求的狀態，這將持續驅動整個AI供應鏈，包括：電源供應、液冷散熱、高階 PCB/CCL 等硬體領域的結構性成長。\n\n徐啟葳指出，今年AI服務的滲透率將是觀察重點，特別是當前AI在企業端的滲透率相當低，但其一旦採用，通常是高價值、高頻率的服務，如Copilot輔助程式設計，這對服務商的自由現金流和投入資本報酬率（ROIC）將有實質貢獻，有益於股價持續維持正向。另外，對於雲端服務供應商而言，目前最大的挑戰是如何將基礎設施的滲透率轉換為足夠的收入。\n\n而AI強勁需求也催動台灣出口及投資動能，主計總處大幅上修2025年經濟成長率至7.37%，徐啟葳認為，在此高基期下，明年經濟成長率也有3.54%，不過，隨著去年基期墊高、大盤指數創高的情況下，預期今年加權指數雖有機會持續表現，但成長幅度或許較去年低，整體來說AI仍為領盤主流，但受到世代轉換、設計轉換等影響，選股難度增加。",

      "Content": "【昨日盤勢】：\n\n週末美國突襲委內瑞拉，雖然國際衝突升溫，但對股市影響有限。上週五費半勁揚逾4%，台積電ADR大漲5%，加上外資調升台積電目標價至2400元，激勵週一台股跳空開高走高，站上3萬大關，不過，在資金排擠下，盤面呈現強中透弱，OTC盤中由漲轉跌，總下跌家數高達1399檔，收盤大漲755點(台積電貢獻677點)，盤面以台積電供應鏈、記憶體及部分低軌衛星族群較受投資人青睞。權值股方面，台積電上漲5.36%，鴻海上漲1.08%，聯發科上漲3.74%，廣達上漲0.36%，台達電上漲1.51%。盤面強勢股，弘塑、昇陽半導體、家登、均華、群創、華東、旺宏、力成、啟碁、鈺創等共35檔漲停；昇達科、萬潤、三集瑞-KY、景碩、晶豪科、中華化、均豪、創意等漲幅6%以上；盤面弱勢股，工信、捷創科技、錸德等共6檔跌停；昱展新藥、老爺知、禾榮科、創泓科技、安國、元晶、台虹、川湖等跌幅7%以上。終場加權指數上漲 755.23 點，以30105.04點作收，成交量為7658.07億元。觀察盤面變化，三大類股漲跌互見，電子上漲3.42%、傳產下跌0.71%、金融上漲0.51%。在次族群部份，以化工、油燃、網通表現較佳，分別上漲2.01%、0.92%、0.90%。\n\n【資金動向】：\n\n三大法人合計買超27.95億元。其中外資賣超76.43億元，投信賣超3.11億元，自營商買超107.49億元。外資買超前五大為華新、彰銀、元大金、南亞、凱基金；賣超前五大為群創、力積電、華邦電、南亞科、玉山金。投信買超前五大為台新新光金、玉山金、亞泥、華邦電、緯創；賣超前五大為彰銀、元大金、寶成、南亞、潤泰新。資券變化方面，融資增43.15億元，融資餘額為3509.48億元，融券增0.2萬張，融券餘額為32.73萬張。外資台指期部位，空單增加1947口，淨空單部位25101口。借券賣出金額為207.4億元。類股成交比重：電子88.12%、傳產9.15%、金融2.73%。\n\n【今日盤勢分析】：\n\n美國12月ISM製造業PMI萎縮幅度超出預期，延續長達10個月的低迷狀態，市場將目光轉移至週五非農就業數據。產業面：據韓國報導，三星與海力士已向伺服器、PC 及智慧手機用 DRAM 客戶提出漲價，今年第一季報價將較去年第四季飆漲60%-70%。美國對委內瑞拉採取行動後，雪佛龍、埃克森美孚、康菲公司等石油巨頭受資金追捧，黃金同步走強，市場風險偏好仍維持穩健。週一美股四大指數齊揚，台積電ADR上漲0.83%。台股後市分析如下：\n\n第一、台積電受惠AI、HPC需求熱絡，先進製程產能嚴重供不應求，供應鏈傳出，台積電2026年啟動先進製程大擴產計畫，2奈米與3奈米並進。其中，2奈米月產能將倍數以上成長，今年底上看10萬片；3奈米月產能則上看15萬片，增幅約三成。法人看好，昇陽半、中砂、台特化及新應材等台積電先進製程重要協力廠未來幾年營運將跟著大爆發。\n\n第二、市場展望今年AI仍是主旋律，隨AI伺服器產業轉向「無電纜化」設計並增加PCB採用量，外資里昂預計，M9銅箔基板的應用將從Rubin運算板擴展至CPX，將採用M7+M9混合設計以及交換器托盤。台光電可望受惠於輝達Rubin中繼板、CPX板及NV Link交換器中採用的M9等級銅箔基板，後市營運可期。\n\n第三、從技術面觀察，週一加權指數向上跳空開高走高，在台積電帶領下站上3萬大關，技術指標KD高檔鈍化、RSI向上延伸、MACD 紅色柱體放大，整體量價齊揚，多方氣勢旺盛。不過，盤面整體下跌家數為1399檔，遠高於上漲家數，凸顯資金排擠。目前技術面多方主導，台積電帶領指數上攻，短線形成較大的正乖離，週一OTC由漲轉跌，壓抑眾多中小型股表現；但指數空間拉開後有助中小型股輪動跟漲，台積電法說及走勢將為指數動能關鍵。\n\n第四、盤面資金聚焦台積電供應鏈、記憶體、低軌衛星等族群，包括弘塑、昇陽半導體、旺宏、晶豪科、昇達科、啟碁等表現強勢。\n\n【投資策略】：\n\n市場淡化國際地緣衝突，美股風險偏好維持穩健。昨日在台積電領軍帶動下，台股強勢站上3萬大關，今日CES展登場，接下來還有大立光與台積電雙王法說會接棒，多項題材及外資、壽險回歸加持，有利延續元月資金行情。惟短線上急漲仍須提防漲多乖離震盪，預期指數震盪盤堅。操作建議維持分批布局業績題材股與AI相關族群為首選，聚焦：AI概念股、台積電法說概念、材料升級或短缺概念、高速傳輸(含光傳輸)、PCB族群、電力能源相關、衛星航太、成衣製鞋及具高殖利率的金控股等族群。\n\n資料來源-MoneyDJ理財網",

      "Content": "日期：2026年 1月 6日\n\n※盤勢分析\n\n外資、壽險歸隊，台積電大漲，台股價量齊揚\n\n◎昨日盤勢\n\n週末美國突襲委內瑞拉，雖然國際衝突升溫，但對股市影響有限。上週五費\n\n半勁揚逾4%，台積電ADR大漲5%，加上外資調升台積電目標價至2400元，激勵週\n\n一台股跳空開高走高，站上3萬大關，不過，在資金排擠下，盤面呈現強中透弱\n\n，OTC盤中由漲轉跌，總下跌家數高達1399檔，收盤大漲755點(台積電貢獻677點\n\n)，盤面以台積電供應鏈、記憶體及部分低軌衛星族群較受投資人青睞。權值股\n\n方面，台積電上漲5.36%，鴻海上漲1.08%，聯發科上漲3.74%，廣達上漲0.36%，\n\n台達電上漲1.51%。\n\n盤面強勢股，弘塑、昇陽半導體、家登、均華、群創、華東、旺宏、力成、\n\n啟碁、鈺創等共35檔漲停；昇達科、萬潤、三集瑞-KY、景碩、晶豪科、中華化\n\n、均豪、創意等漲幅6%以上；盤面弱勢股，工信、捷創科技、錸德等共6檔跌停\n\n；昱展新藥、老爺知、禾榮科、創泓科技、安國、元晶、台虹、川湖等跌幅7%以\n\n上。終場加權指數上漲 755.23 點，以30105.04點作收，成交量為7658.07億元\n\n。觀察盤面變化，三大類股漲跌互見，電子上漲3.42%、傳產下跌0.71%、金融上\n\n漲0.51%。在次族群部份，以化工、油燃、網通表現較佳，分別上漲2.01%、\n\n0.92%、0.90%。\n\n◎資金動向\n\n三大法人合計買超27.95億元。其中外資賣超76.43億元，投信賣超3.11億元\n\n，自營商買超107.49億元。外資買超前五大為華新、彰銀、元大金、南亞、凱基\n\n金；賣超前五大為群創、力積電、華邦電、南亞科、玉山金。投信買超前五大為\n\n台新新光金、玉山金、亞泥、華邦電、緯創；賣超前五大為彰銀、元大金、寶成\n\n、南亞、潤泰新。資券變化方面，融資增43.15億元，融資餘額為3509.48億元，\n\n融券增0.2萬張，融券餘額為32.73萬張。外資台指期部位，空單增加1947口，淨\n\n空單部位25101口。借券賣出金額為207.4億元。類股成交比重：電子88.12%、傳\n\n產9.15%、金融2.73%。\n\n◎今日盤勢分析\n\n美國12月ISM製造業PMI萎縮幅度超出預期，延續長達10個月的低迷狀態，市\n\n場將目光轉移至週五非農就業數據。產業面：據韓國報導，三星與海力士已向伺\n\n服器、PC及智慧手機用 DRAM 客戶提出漲價，今年第一季報價將較去年第四季飆\n\n漲60%-70%。美國對委內瑞拉採取行動後，雪佛龍、埃克森美孚、康菲公司等石\n\n油巨頭受資金追捧，黃金同步走強，市場風險偏好仍維持穩健。週一美股四大指\n\n數齊揚，台積電ADR上漲0.83%。台股後市分析如下：\n\n第一、台積電受惠AI、HPC需求熱絡，先進製程產能嚴重供不應求，供應鏈\n\n傳出，台積電2026年啟動先進製程大擴產計畫，2奈米與3奈米並進。其中，2奈\n\n米月產能將倍數以上成長，今年底上看10萬片；3奈米月產能則上看15萬片，增\n\n幅約三成。法人看好，昇陽半、中砂、台特化及新應材等台積電先進製程重要協\n\n力廠未來幾年營運將跟著大爆發。\n\n第二、市場展望今年AI仍是主旋律，隨AI伺服器產業轉向「無電纜化」設計\n\n並增加PCB採用量，外資里昂預計，M9銅箔基板的應用將從Rubin運算板擴展至\n\nCPX，將採用M7+M9混合設計以及交換器托盤。台光電可望受惠於輝達Rubin中繼\n\n板、CPX板及NV Link交換器中採用的M9等級銅箔基板，後市營運可期。\n\n第三、從技術面觀察，週一加權指數向上跳空開高走高，在台積電帶領下站\n\n上3萬大關，技術指標KD高檔鈍化、RSI向上延伸、MACD 紅色柱體放大，整體量\n\n價齊揚，多方氣勢旺盛。不過，盤面整體下跌家數為1399檔，遠高於上漲家數，\n\n凸顯資金排擠。目前技術面多方主導，台積電帶領指數上攻，短線形成較大的正\n\n乖離，週一OTC由漲轉跌，壓抑眾多中小型股表現；但指數空間拉開後有助中小\n\n型股輪動跟漲，台積電法說及走勢將為指數動能關鍵。\n\n第四、盤面資金聚焦台積電供應鏈、記憶體、低軌衛星等族群，包括弘塑、\n\n昇陽半導體、旺宏、晶豪科、昇達科、啟碁等表現強勢。\n\n◎投資策略\n\n市場淡化國際地緣衝突，美股風險偏好維持穩健。昨日在台積電領軍帶動下\n\n，台股強勢站上3萬大關，今日CES展登場，接下來還有大立光與台積電雙王法說\n\n會接棒，多項題材及外資、壽險回歸加持，有利延續元月資金行情。惟短線上急\n\n漲仍須提防漲多乖離震盪，預期指數震盪盤堅。操作建議維持分批布局業績題材\n\n股與AI相關族群為首選，聚焦：AI概念股、台積電法說概念、材料升級或短缺概\n\n念、高速傳輸(含光傳輸)、PCB族群、電力能源相關、衛星航太、成衣製鞋及具\n\n高殖利率的金控股等族群。",

      "Content": "輝達（NVIDIA）執行長黃仁勳於CES 2026發表主題演說，以台北101影像作為開場鋪陳，象徵AI產業正邁入全新階段。黃仁勳直言，全球運算架構已站上歷史轉折點，過去數十年以CPU與傳統軟體為核心的產業邏輯，正在被AI全面重寫。\n\n根據《工商時報》6日報導指出，黃仁勳表示，第一個結構性改變，是應用程式本身的本質正在轉變。傳統軟體仰賴工程師預先撰寫與編譯，如今則逐步由模型即時生成內容，從影像畫面到語言token，幾乎每一個細節都由AI動態產生。他形容，AI不再只是工具，而是承載未來所有應用的基礎平台，全球既有IT系統勢必全面翻新，龐大的研發與資本支出也正快速向AI集中。\n\n第二個關鍵變革，則是運算核心的世代交替。黃仁勳強調，產業已正式走出CPU主導時代，GPU與各類加速運算正成為主流。隨著模型規模與推論需求呈指數成長，傳統架構已難以負荷，運算堆疊必須從底層重新設計，才能支撐下一階段的AI發展。\n\n報導稱，談到AI的演進方向，黃仁勳歸納三大突破路徑，包括具備更強邏輯能力的推理型模型、可自主執行任務的代理式AI，以及他反覆強調的「實體AI」。他指出，真正的關鍵不在於AI是否能生成內容，而在於是否能理解物理世界的因果關係，並在真實環境中做出正確行動；這將決定AI能否從數位空間走向現實世界。\n\n在自動駕駛領域，輝達同步揭示全新端到端自駕AI架構。黃仁勳指出，新系統不只負責感知環境，更具備推理與決策能力，能從攝影機輸入一路整合到轉向、煞車與加速控制，並在每次動作前清楚說明行為邏輯。他表示，透過大量人類駕駛示範資料，搭配由世界模型生成的合成場景，自駕系統可在虛擬環境中累積近乎無限的行駛經驗，進而克服過去難以處理的極端情境。\n\n機器人發展同樣被視為實體AI的重要落腳點。黃仁勳指出，真正可用的機器人，必須同時具備訓練、推論與模擬三種運算能力。輝達透過高度擬真的數位分身與模擬環境，讓機器人在虛擬世界中反覆學習與測試，再將成果快速導入現實場域，藉此縮短從研發到商用的時間差。\n\n該份報導也提到，在平台層面，黃仁勳也宣布新一代Vera Rubin系統正式進入量產階段。他坦言，面對模型規模與推論強度同步暴增，僅靠製程微縮已無法延續效能曲線，輝達因此選擇從CPU、GPU、互連、網路到DPU全面重新設計，採取極限協同設計，將效能與效率直接內嵌於硬體之中。\n\n黃仁勳指出，Vera Rubin並非單一晶片升級，而是一整套運算平台。新一代GPU在電晶體增幅有限的情況下，仍能大幅拉開推論與訓練效能差距，關鍵在於硬體層即完成精度與效率的動態調整；系統層則透過高速互連與新型網路架構，解決生成式AI長上下文與資料流量瓶頸問題。\n\n黃仁勳同時也點名，台積電為Vera Rubin幕後關鍵推手之一，輝達與台積電從先進製程、先進封裝一路延伸至光電整合，展開深度協同設計，並透過COUPE技術，將矽光子技術直接導入交換晶片，打造具備512埠、單埠200Gbps傳輸能力的Spectrum-X光電乙太網路晶片。黃仁勳直言，唯有跨晶片、跨系統的整體設計，才能在摩爾定律趨緩的情況下，持續推動運算效能前進。\n\n黃仁勳最後定調，輝達下一階段的核心目標，已不只是推動生成式AI，而是打造能理解世界、並在現實中行動的實體AI。隨著自駕車與機器人逐步成熟，AI產業的競爭，正從單點效能之爭，升級為平台與生態系的長期戰局。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導美元又輸了？「銅礦大國」為何接受人民幣繳稅 外媒揭北京逆襲再下一城台灣「富豪」多有錢？金管會數據驚人 光是財管就破2兆AI泡沫疑慮 專家揭「四級崩盤預警」！點名這2家風險最高",

Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch.\nQUALCOMM Investment Narrative Recap To own Qualcomm, you need to believe its core handset and licensing engine can fund a transition into broader AI-enabled devices, from PCs to cars and now robots. The Dragonwing IQ10 robotics launch adds to that diversification story but does not meaningfully change the near term focus on upcoming earnings and handset demand, or the key risk from rising in-house chip efforts at major OEMs and intensifying competition in China.\n\nAmong recent announcements, Qualcomm’s deeper push into Windows PCs with the Snapdragon X2 Plus at CES sits closest to this “beyond smartphones” narrative, alongside Dragonwing. Both product lines are tied to the same catalyst: broader adoption of AI-capable edge devices that could gradually reduce Qualcomm’s reliance on smartphones, while still leaving it exposed to execution risk in newer markets such as PCs, automotive, and industrial IoT.\nBut investors should also be aware that escalating in-house chip development by large OEMs could...\nRead the full narrative on QUALCOMM (it's free!)\nQUALCOMM's narrative projects $46.9 billion revenue and $12.2 billion earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "AMD\n\nInvesting.com -- NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is accelerating its release cycle, announcing at the CES 2026 convention on Monday that its highly anticipated Rubin data center products are in full production and nearing release this year. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang used his keynote presentation in Las Vegas to signal that Nvidia is maintaining its lead in the aggressive race to supply the infrastructure for artificial intelligence.\n\nAll six chips in the Rubin platform are back from manufacturing partners and have passed initial milestone tests, putting them on track for customer deployment in the second half of 2026. The move to detail these products at CES underscores a push to keep the industry tethered to Nvidia hardware as competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and in-house silicon efforts from cloud providers intensifies.\nFaster Training, Cheaper Inference\n\nThe Rubin accelerator is designed to address the massive compute requirements of agentic AI models that solve problems through multistage reasoning rather than simple pattern recognition. According to the company, the Rubin GPU is:\n3.5 times better at training AI models than the current Blackwell architecture.\n5 times better at running (inference) AI software.\n\nThe platform includes a new Vera CPU featuring 88 custom cores, which provides twice the performance of the component it replaces. Nvidia emphasized that Rubin-based systems will be more cost-effective for operators, returning the same results as Blackwell while using significantly fewer components and up to 10x lower cost per token.\nExpanding the AI Factory\n\nNvidia is positioning the Rubin platform as a modular \"supercomputer in a box.\" The hardware includes the BlueField-4 DPU, which acts as an AI-native storage processor. By managing \"context memory,\" the chip allows AI agents to retain long-term information without bottlenecking the main processors, a move that boosts power efficiency by 5x.\n\nEarly adopters of the Vera Rubin NVL72 rack systems include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which plans to integrate them into its Fairwater AI superfactories, alongside Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Cloud Infrastructure.\nThe ’ChatGPT Moment’ for Robotics, ’Inflection Point’ for AV\nBeyond the data center, Huang characterized the current era as the \"ChatGPT moment\" for physical AI, and an ’inflection point’ for autonomous vehicles. To broaden adoption across the economy, Nvidia unveiled:\n\nStory Continues\nAlpamayo: A family of open AI models designed to help autonomous vehicles reason through rare \"long-tail\" driving scenarios. Nvidia plans to test a Level 4 robotaxi service with a partner as soon as 2027.\nJetson T4000: A new robotics module based on the Blackwell architecture, delivering 4x the energy efficiency for humanoid robots and industrial automation.\n\nWhile some on Wall Street remain wary of the sustainability of massive AI capital expenditures, Nvidia’s early reveal of Rubin suggests the company is betting that the shift toward reasoning-based AI will require a total market infrastructure upgrade measured in the trillions of dollars.\nRelated articles\nNvidia accelerates AI roadmap: Rubin superchip in full production, 5x faster\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now",

      "Content": "輝達（NVIDIA）執行長黃仁勳在CES特別演講中，正式揭示新一代 Vera Rubin 平台已進入全面量產階段，並完整說明此世代背後的系統級變革。黃仁勳直言，面對模型規模、推論 token 與訓練強度呈指數級暴增，單靠製程微縮已無法支撐效能曲線，「這一代我們別無選擇，只能重新設計六大關鍵晶片，以極限co-design 同步推進整個運算堆疊。」\n\n黃仁勳指出，Vera Rubin 並非單一 GPU 升級，而是一套橫跨 CPU、GPU、互連、網路、DPU 與交換晶片的整體平台。核心包括全新 Vera CPU 與 Rubin GPU，前者以 88 核心、176 執行緒的空間多執行緒設計，強化單執行緒與 I/O 能力；後者在僅約 1.6 倍電晶體成長下，卻實現 5 倍推論、3.5 倍訓練 的峰值效能躍升，關鍵在於 NVFP4 Tensor Core 等硬體級精度動態調整，將以往難以軟體化的運算效率直接內嵌於晶片之中。\n\n在系統層，Vera Rubin 採用 NVLink 72 與新一代 Spectrum-X AI 乙太網路，並結合 BlueField-4 DPU，將 east-west 與 north-south 流量分流處理；同時單顆 GPU 可擴展至額外16 TB，直指生成式 AI 長上下文與測試時擴展（test-time scaling）的瓶頸。黃仁勳形容，這不僅是效能競賽，更是資料中心投資回報率的分水嶺。\n\n值得注意的是，Vera Rubin 在散熱與能效上同樣翻轉既有想像。平台全面液冷，無需冷卻機組，即便整體功耗倍增，氣流與水溫條件卻與前代相當，估算可為全球資料中心節省約 6% 用電。同時，全系統匯流排（PCIe、NVLink、CPU-GPU）皆支援全程加密，滿足企業級機密運算需求。\n\n黃仁勳點名，台積電為 Vera Rubin 幕後關鍵推手之一。輝達與台積電在製程、封裝到光電整合展開深度 co-design，並以其 COUPE 技術，將矽光子（Silicon Photonics）直接整合至交換晶片，打造 512 埠、200Gbps 的 Spectrum-X 光電乙太網路晶片。黃仁勳強調，這類跨晶片、跨系統的協同設計，是突破摩爾定律放緩的唯一道路。\n\n在時程上，黃仁勳明確表示，繼 GB200/GB300之後，Vera Rubin 已於今年進入量產，可即時銜接雲端與 AI 工廠部署。他以天文學家 Vera Rubin 發現暗物質的典故比喻，稱新平台正是為了解決 AI 時代「看不見、卻決定一切的運算需求」而生。\n\n法人解讀，Vera Rubin 的全面量產，不僅鞏固輝達在 AI 訓練與推論的技術門檻，也再次凸顯台積電在先進製程、先進封裝與異質整合上的不可替代性。隨著極限 co-design 成為新常態，AI 晶片競賽已從單點效能，全面升級為「平台與供應鏈」的長期戰。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導南亞科已不便宜！PCB女王喊快下車 記憶體看好「這2檔」原因曝 輝達買Croq：對台積電是大利多財經選讀》陸33歲小鎮青年為何讓Meta豪砸627億 拒絕字節跳動、投奔美國有底氣目標價1表看》不是仁寶、緯創…法人喊買7檔老AI 「這檔」明年營收增4成：竟還有100元上漲空間",

So this is Nvidia's new super chip.\n00:04 Speaker A\nJensen Wong saying now it's in full production. So this is one of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its its Ruben platform. What is your technical take there Austin? and we we turned to you of course because, listen, you were a former hardware engineered Intel, you got the chops to to weigh in here.\n00:29 Austin\nYeah, this is everything we expect from Nvidia. Uh 10x higher throughput, 1/10th the token cost.\n00:39 Austin\nand that's from innovating at the system level. So not just the GPU but the GPU, the networking and we even saw some innovations around memory storage. So, I think this is exactly what everyone expected from these technology leaders in Nvidia.\n00:58 Speaker A\nI want to get bring Paul in here too. But Austin, just quickly, another technical question I had as I was listening there. These Rubin-based systems, Austin, that that Jensen is talking about, how are they different? How do they compare and contrast Austin? Can you put it simply for me to to their previous versions to Blackwell? Is it is it about performance Austin? Is it cheaper to run? How do they compare and contrast?\n01:25 Austin\nYeah, so there's more compute power, but the system is optimized via software. Um even using these DPUs, these network processors at the system level to take an LLM and run it at much higher throughput and much lower cost. So it's it's it's similar to to Blackwell, similar to Hopper. It's the next generation but just improved. It's kind of more of everything, more compute, um better networking and more system optimization specifically around LLMs.",

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nCrowdStrike recently announced its third annual Cybersecurity Startup Accelerator with Amazon Web Services and NVIDIA, an eight-week program supporting 35 AI-driven cloud security startups with mentorship, technical resources, and potential investment from the Falcon Fund.\nThis accelerator underlines how CrowdStrike is positioning itself at the center of next-generation AI security development by cultivating startups that could expand and enrich its broader ecosystem.\nWe’ll now examine how CrowdStrike’s expanded AI-focused accelerator program with AWS and NVIDIA could influence its investment narrative and growth ambitions.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 29 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery . The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.\nCrowdStrike Holdings Investment Narrative Recap To own CrowdStrike, you need to believe its Falcon platform and AI capabilities can keep it at the center of cloud security while justifying a rich valuation with sustained growth and strong subscription momentum. The expanded AWS and NVIDIA accelerator supports that AI leadership story, but its impact on near term catalysts like subscription growth and ARR trends, or on key risks such as intense competition and execution around Falcon Flex, is more incremental than material right now.\n\nThe most relevant recent development here is CrowdStrike’s broader collaboration with AWS, including deeper integrations and pay as you go access to Falcon Cloud Security and Next Gen SIEM through AWS Marketplace. This ties directly into one of the main bullish drivers for the stock, as stronger cloud channel partnerships and easier procurement can support faster deal cycles and greater cloud related revenue over time, reinforcing the investment case around its ecosystem position and data scale.\nYet for all the promise of AI partnerships and accelerators, investors should be aware that competitive pressures and the need for rapid innovation could...\nRead the full narrative on CrowdStrike Holdings (it's free!)\nCrowdStrike Holdings' narrative projects $7.9 billion revenue and $691.1 million earnings by 2028.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-nadella-wants-us-stop-230956814.html",
      "Content": "ANTH.PVT\n\nAMZN\n\nCRM\n\nA couple of weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” as its word of the year , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella weighed in on what to expect from AI in 2026.\nIn his classic, intellectual style, Nadella wrote on his personal blog that he wants us to stop thinking of AI as “slop” and start thinking of it as “bicycles for the mind.”\n\nHe wrote, “A new concept that evolves ‘bicycles for the mind’ such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute.”\nHe continued: “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”\nIf you parse through those syllables, you may see that he’s not only urging everyone to stop thinking of AI-generated content as slop, but also wants the tech industry to stop talking about AI as a replacement for humans . He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead.\nHere’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of replacing human labor as a way to price it, and justify its expense.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs , raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in an interview on 60 Minutes .\nYet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind checking the AI’s work for accuracy ).\nOne oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg , which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor.\n\nWhile this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is how much of a job can be offloaded to AI . It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the tasks it cites as examples include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code.\nThat’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called Blood in the Machine . Then there are the high unemployment rates among new grad junior coders .\n\nStory Continues\nBut it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet.\nSo it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nThe Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable.\nThe irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off over 15,000 people in 2025 , even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its last fiscal year, which closed in June — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a public memo about the layoffs after these results.\nNotably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he did say that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality).\n\nThe truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 AI is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones.\nTo be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, CNBC reported. That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft and other tech companies chasing AI.\nAnd to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses , too.",

      "Content": "UBER\n\nCAT\n\n066570.KS\n\nGOOG\n\nLAS VEGAS — Nvidia ( NVDA ) is touting its latest robotics advancements at CES 2026 as the broader tech industry begins a large-scale effort to bring humanoid robots to life.\nDuring the company's keynote on Monday, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that firms ranging from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar ( CAT ) to LG Electronics and NEURA Robotics are using Nvidia's robotics technologies to develop and power their various bots.\n\nNvidia has claimed that physical AI could revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries, and the company wants to be at the center of it all.\nDuring CES, Nvidia revealed a variety of new AI models to help train robots to interact with the world around them, as well as the hardware necessary to power their digital brains.\nIn addition to humanoid bots, Nvidia showed off a new family of models for self-driving cars called Alpamayo. According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\nNvidia said companies including Lucid ( LCID ), Uber ( UBER ), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Today at the Consumer Electronics show, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang officially launched the company’s new Rubin computing architecture, which he described as the state of the art in AI hardware. The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year.\n\n“Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang told the audience. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.”\nThe Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024 , is the latest result of Nvidia’s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.\n\nRubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic , OpenAI , and Amazon Web Services . Rubin systems will also be used in HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.\n\nNamed for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin , the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.\nExplaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems.\n“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs . “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”\n\nAs expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.\nRubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.",

      "Content": "Amazon has purchased the land it plans to use for a distribution center in Eugene.\nAmazon.com Services LLC paid $2 million on Dec. 26 for the lot on Highway 99 where the company intends to build a large e-commerce center. The sale was first reported by Eugene Weekly and confirmed by the Register-Guard, which also obtained a copy of the deed.\n\nAmazon plans to develop offices, an employee training center, a warehouse, a distribution facility and fleet storage with 370 parking spaces on the 84-acre lot bordering Highway 99, the airport and Awbrey Lane.\nHow will Amazon's plan affect traffic? According to an application submitted to the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency, the distribution center will add 2,592 trips per day to Highway 99. The city of Eugene's website states the developers estimate that fewer than 100 of the daily trips will occur between 7 and 8 a.m. and 4 and 5 p.m.\nWhat about the wetlands? Amazon's proposal will permanently alter 6.75 acres of wetlands through infill and removal of soil. Developers have proposed to mitigate this by purchasing Amazon Prairie wetland mitigation credits from the city of Eugene. Public comment closed Jan 2. and was being reviewed by the Oregon Department of State Lands, which is scheduled to give a response to the application by March 2.\n\nWhat types of delivery vehicles will Amazon use? As a condition of the LRAPA permit, Amazon committed to using 25% electric vehicles in Year 1, 40% in Year 5 and 70% in Year 10.\nHow big will the Amazon warehouse be? Several permit applications have indicated the facility will be 318,000 square feet. Compared to one of Eugene's largest industrial campuses, the defunct Hynix chip factory which covers 1.2 million square feet, the Amazon development is a fraction of the size. And it is dwarfed by Amazon's Woodburn facility, which opened late last year and is billed as the largest building in Oregon at 3.5 million square feet.\nAlan Torres covers local government for the Register-Guard.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.54 billion people daily. Meta Platforms&rsquo; growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>> )\n\nShares of Bank of America have gained +16.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry&rsquo;s gain of +17.3%. The company's net interest income (NII) will likely be aided by decent loan growth, despite rate cuts. The Zacks analyst expects NII to see a CAGR of 5.7% by 2027.\n\nPlans to open financial centers in new and existing markets, and improve digital capabilities will support the top line. We project total revenues to grow 6.9% in 2025. Yet the volatile nature of the capital markets makes growth in trading revenues uncertain. Despite a robust trading performance since 2022, growth may normalize going forward.\n\nWhile we expect sales and trading revenues to increase in 2025, the metric will likely decline in 2026. Elevated expenses due to steady investments in its franchise will likely hurt bottom-line growth. The Zacks analyst expects expenses to rise 4.3% in 2025. Weak asset quality is another obstacle.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>> )\n\nProcter & Gamble&rsquo;s shares have declined -10.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry&rsquo;s decline of -11%.

      "Content": "TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n086280.KS\n\nLAS VEGAS — Hyundai is joining the global push into robotics, announcing at CES 2026 that it plans to set up a manufacturing system capable of producing thousands of robots per year by 2028.\nAtlas is among the most advanced humanoid robots in the world. You've likely seen videos online of the bot doing everything from maneuvering obstacle courses to picking up heavy boxes.\n\nHyundai, which acquired a majority stake in Boston Dynamics in a 2021 deal that valued the company at $1.1 billion, said it will deploy Atlas in its facilities in 2028. The bot will focus on parts sequencing — ensuring vehicle parts are placed in the correct areas of a plant when they're needed.\nThe company said that by 2030 it will begin using Atlas for more complex tasks, including component assembly, and eventually for jobs that involve repetitive motions or require heavy lifting and other tasks.\nOn the manufacturing front, Hyundai said it will leverage its Hyundai Mobis auto parts arm and Hyundai Glovis logistics firm to develop an end-to-end robotics value chain that will allow it to produce some 30,000 robots a year.\nPart of the plan calls for Hyundai to expand its robotics as a service (RaaS) model, in which customers pay for subscription plans to use the Hyundai's robots, to more companies.\nHyundai isn't the only company looking to dominate the robotics space. Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk is keen on making the automaker's Optimus robots the go-to humanoid robots for businesses around the world.\nFigure is developing humanoid robots for labor-intensive settings, the home, and outer space. Apptronik has its own Apollo humanoid bot, while Agility Robotics' Digit is already being used in some Amazon ( AMZN ) warehouses.\n\n1X Technologies is already offering its Neo home robot via a $499 per month subscription or $20,000 to own it outright.\nChina's Unitree, meanwhile, sells its humanoid robot G1 for $13,500 and its more advanced H1 for $90,000 .\nCompanies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), which has partnered with Hyundai, are also looking to physical AI and humanoid robotics as the next major breakthrough areas for their processing capabilities.\nManufacturing, logistics, and shipping firms have been using various robots for years, but humanoid bots are still a relatively new frontier. The idea is that humanoid robots will be able to slide into roles that are too dangerous or tedious for humans without requiring large-scale changes to things like factory floors.\nSimilarly, humanoid robots could prove helpful in hospital and care facilities.\nBut so far, home robots have been largely limited to things like robot vacuums. Amazon has its own non-humanoid Astro home robot that serves as a kind of rolling security guard, and Samsung is working on its Ballie robot .\n\nStory Continues\nIt also remains to be seen whether consumers will be comfortable sharing their living spaces with robots that are roughly the same size as them.\nThat said, at the rate the tech is advancing, we could find out sooner rather than later.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Intel stock surged early in Monday's trading, but it's bullish momentum has receded.\nSome investors were betting that recent developments in Venezuela would be a part of bullish dynamics for Intel.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nIntel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock rocketed higher early in Monday's trading, but it has since given up nearly all of those gains. The company's share price was flat as of 3:20 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.6%. Intel stock had been up as much as 6.9% earlier in the day's trading.\nIntel stock initially posted big gains on geopolitical news Over the weekend, U.S. military forces carried out an operation to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power. While that may not seem particularly significant for Intel stock, it's a development that could have significant implications for the company's foundry business.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing currently dominates the chip foundry market, but some investors and analysts are concerned that a potential move by China to exercise greater control over Taiwan could destabilize the industry leader's business. Intel is trying to position itself as a U.S.-based alternative to TSMC, and its stock saw strong bullish momentum early in today's trading before investors reassessed their read on what recent developments in Venezuela could mean for broader geopolitical dynamics.\n\nWhat's next for Intel? Intel is a business that remains squarely in turnaround mode. On the design side, the company has been losing market share when it comes to central processing units ( CPUs ) for PCs and servers. Meanwhile, there's little indication that the company's foundry business has been securing big contract wins for its latest process nodes.\n\nThis year looks poised to be a very important one for Intel. If the company's foundry business can win big contracts for artificial intelligence ( AI ) chips, its stock could see dramatic gains -- but it remains to be seen if the manufacturing unit will deliver.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first ⁠products with the 18A manufacturing process ‌in 2025, referring to the Panther Lake chips.\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is ‍making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips ​to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ‌would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ⁠EST on Monday (0230 GMT on Tuesday).

      "Content": "台積電股價再攀新高，但過去引領房市的台積宅交易動能則降到冰點，據統計，2025年前十月全台各行政區預售屋交易量僅3.02萬件、量縮73％，減幅前十名行政區量縮逾9成，量縮排名前列的嘉義朴子、新竹寶山、竹東等地台積題材退燒後房市打回原形，高雄市更有四個行政區預售屋年減幅破9成，全台最多。\n\n永慶房屋研展中心副理陳金萍表示，2025年預售市場延續2024年下半年較低迷市況，消費者購屋心態偏保守觀望，量能受到壓縮，全台前十月預售屋總銷金額0.59兆元、年減70.4%。\n\n其中，嘉義縣朴子市前十月預售屋交易量僅41件、年減95.4%，減幅居全台之冠，朴子市受惠台積電進駐嘉義科學園區的外溢效應，當地預售屋價格已提前反映未來就業與人口移入的上漲預期，建商短期不斷推出建案，供給量快速暴增，持續受政策影響，房價基期已高、市場又供過於求，預售市場量縮相當明顯。\n\n同樣受惠台積電設廠的寶山鄉、鄰近竹科的竹東鎮，預售屋交易均量縮92.3%，新竹蛋黃區預售屋房價直線飆升帶動外圍房價達相對高檔，加上受政策衝擊，兩地市場陷入急凍，前十月成交分別僅40餘件、60餘件。\n\n高雄包括大樹、前金、仁武、鳳山四個行政區年減幅也超過九成，陳金萍表示，近年高雄市因產業題材及建設到位，預售市場價量齊揚，2024年下半年受政策衝擊後，呈現量縮價跌格局，預售買氣不振，先前房市熱絡的北高雄，在台積電設廠帶動下，整體房市關注度提升，仁武區生活機能成熟、通勤便利，也出現嚴重量縮，2024年交易量破千件，2025年僅剩不到百件。\n\n更多工商時報報導大啖低軌衛星通訊元件訂單 昇達科11月每股賺0.34元欣興董座：載板樂觀到2026立院送冬至大禮 降稅 延至2024年底",

This frames the recent rally in a tighter valuation band.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how relatively modest revenue assumptions, shifting profit margins and a future earnings multiple come together to support a higher fair value than that consensus target? The most popular narrative spells out the growth path, the margin reset and the rating the market would need to accept. The full story is in how those moving parts interact over several years, not just in one headline number.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $38.14 (OVERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this hinges on Intel simplifying its structure and tightening execution, and slower AI adoption or manufacturing setbacks could quickly challenge the case for overvaluation.\nFind out about the key risks to this Intel narrative.\nAnother View: Market Pricing Versus Cash Flows The popular narrative says Intel is about 3.3% overvalued at US$39.38 versus a fair value of roughly US$38.14. Our DCF model paints a sharper contrast, with an estimate of US$14.33, implying the shares are trading well above that cash flow based view. Which story do you think is closer to reality?\n\nStory Continues\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nBuild Your Own Intel Narrative If you see the numbers differently, treat this as a starting point, test your own assumptions in the model, and build a view that fits your thesis, Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Intel research is our analysis highlighting 3 key rewards and 2 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\n\nLooking for more investment ideas? If Intel has sharpened your interest, do not stop here; broaden your watchlist with other clear stories where the numbers and business cases line up.\nSpot potential high growth breakouts early by scanning these 3562 penny stocks with strong financials , which pair smaller market caps with solid financial underpinnings and room for future business expansion.\nZero in on future facing themes by tracking these 25 AI penny stocks , which link artificial intelligence exposure with listed companies you can actually analyse and monitor over time.\nHunt for price tags that look more modest than the underlying cash flow profiles by filtering for these 878 undervalued stocks based on cash flows , which might deserve a closer look.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Last year was not a particularly pleasant year for Tesla (TSLA) stock, with the shares turning red at one point and briefly ranking as the worst performer in the “Magnificent Seven.” There has also been the challenge of falling deliveries and the real prospect of a second straight year of volume decline. Mounting doubts about demand have grown as Tesla cedes market share in key regions.\n\nEurope has been especially tough, with November registrations sliding in major markets like France and Sweden despite a refreshed Model Y lineup. Intensifying competition and an aging model range have weighed heavily on sales.\nMore News from Barchart How Did the 3 Kings of Commodities React to Weekend Developments?\nWhy ConocoPhillips Is One of the Top Oil Stocks to Buy After Venezuela\nChevron, ConocoPhillips, and Gold: Your Critical Watchlist After the U.S.–Venezuela Oil Market Shock\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nHowever, the debate over what comes next is only getting louder and more polarized. Baird has reiterated its bullish stance on Tesla and attached a $548 price target heading into 2026, effectively arguing that 2025’s reset is a setup for a stronger payoff rather than the start of a long fade.\nSo after such a bruising year, is Tesla really setting up for a 2026 comeback, or is the optimism still running ahead of reality? Let's dive in.\nTesla’s 2025 Numbers Still Look Like a “Core Holding” Tesla, headquartered in Austin, Texas, with a market cap of nearly $1.53 trillion, designs and manufactures electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and related software.\nTSLA stock closed around $454.43 on Dec. 30, up about 12.53% year-to-date (YTD) and currently sits about 11% up over the past 52 weeks.\nIts valuation implies a trailing P/E of roughly 327.72x versus a sector median near 16.41x and a P/S of 16.18x versus a sector median of around 0.97x, signaling that investors are still willing to pay a hefty premium.​\nIt reported its most recent quarterly EPS of $0.50 on Oct. 22. Their sales stood at about $28.1 billion for that period, with revenue growth of roughly 24.89%, showing that top‑line momentum remains solid even after a more challenging year.\n\nIts net income figure of roughly $1.37 billion, growing about 17.15%, indicates that profitability is still moving in the right direction, even as pricing and competitive pressures have intensified.\nThe operating cash flow of approximately $10.93 billion, up about 132.84%, highlights how much more cash the business is now generating from its core operations versus a year ago. That strength flows through to the net cash flow of roughly $2.55 billion, with a staggering 943.38% increase. This improvement culminated in free cash flow jumping to nearly $4B, a record for the company.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla’s 2026 Growth Levers Tesla is making a direct push into the U.K. energy market, beyond selling vehicles and batteries. The company is bidding to supply electricity to British households and businesses across the U.K.\nTesla submitted a formal bid for an electricity license to Ofgem after a notice was posted on a government website. If regulators approve the application, Tesla could start competing with the major electricity suppliers as soon as 2026.​\n\nAnother catalyst sits in energy storage. Tesla reportedly reached a multi‑billion supply agreement with Samsung SDI valued at more than 3 trillion won, or about $2.1B.\nThe deal would run for roughly three years and focus on battery cells for Tesla’s Energy Storage System business, not its EV lineup. Those cells are intended for Megapack and potentially Powerwall, which keeps the emphasis on grid and residential storage demand.\nWall Street’s Numbers Say “Messy Now, Better Later” Tesla’s next real checkpoint for this narrative is its upcoming earnings release, scheduled for Feb. 2, where the Street’s expectations already tell a nuanced story. The current quarter (12/2025) carries an average EPS estimate of $0.34 versus $0.66 a year ago, implying a steep 48.48% year-over-year (YoY) decline as 2025’s margin pressure shows up cleanly in the bottom line.\n\nIts next quarter (03/2026) has estimates at $0.33 versus just $0.15 in the prior year, pointing to a sharp 120% YoY rebound if Tesla can execute.\nThat brings the conversation naturally to how the Street is framing the stock right now, as 40 analysts surveyed on TSLA land on a consensus “Hold” rating. The average price target across that group is $395.32, which is actually below its current price and implies roughly 13% downside from here, not upside.\nConclusion Tesla’s 2025 feels like a stress test that never quite ended, but the numbers and narrative don’t point to a broken story. With earnings reset lower, free cash flow ramping hard, and energy and AI acting as the next growth legs, the setup into 2026 looks more like a “prove‑it” phase than a last stand.\nIn the near term, the stock probably chops around current levels or even gives back some ground as the market waits for cleaner evidence that margins and earnings can catch up to the valuation.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "The analyst fair value estimate for Alphabet shares has shifted modestly, from about US$323.70 to roughly US$330.24, supported by a slightly lower 8.24% discount rate and a higher modelled revenue growth rate of around 13.18%. This update lines up with recent research that focuses on Alphabet’s AI execution across Search, YouTube and Cloud, and how products like Gemini, AI Mode and custom TPUs could feed into future growth and valuation. Stay with this article to see how you can keep on top of these changing assumptions and the evolving narrative around Alphabet.\n\nStay updated as the Fair Value for Alphabet shifts by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Alphabet.\nWhat Wall Street Has Been Saying 🐂 Bullish Takeaways\nMany firms highlight Alphabet's AI execution across Search, YouTube and Cloud, with Needham lifting its price target to US$330 after pointing to a \"strong\" Q3, including 15% Search growth, 34% Cloud growth and 15% YouTube growth, and arguing that Alphabet's full stack GenAI go to market is feeding both revenue and margin strength.\nSeveral analysts frame Alphabet as one of the better positioned AI platforms, with Goldman Sachs raising its target to US$288 and Scotiabank moving to US$336 as they point to Gemini adoption, AI monetization and what they describe as strong execution across the business.\nCloud is a recurring positive, with Piper Sandler lifting its target to US$330 on the back of Alphabet's Q3 results, including a Cloud backlog that reached US$155b, and Loop Capital upgrading the stock while arguing that the opportunity for Alphabet's proprietary AI processors is becoming better appreciated.\nNewer coverage is also constructive, with HSBC starting Alphabet with a Buy rating and a US$285 target while emphasizing Gemini, custom chips and core Search and Cloud as key assets, and BNP Paribas Exane initiating with an Outperform rating and a US$355 target.\nSome analysts still flag constraints, often around how much upside is already reflected in the share price and the timing of AI features. Wells Fargo, for example, is keeping an Equal Weight rating while raising its target to US$236 and pointing out that sentiment has turned more positive but that disruption from AI Mode changes to default search is more of a 2026 story.\n\n🐻 Bearish Takeaways\nThere are fewer outright bearish voices in the recent research, but some firms are cautious on ancillary projects. Wells Fargo, for example, questions the economics of Waymo food delivery and sees a challenging path to scale at current cost levels.\nA subset of analysts focus on risk rather than upside, with Wells Fargo highlighting that Google is not entirely \"in the clear\" despite better ad trends and that changes like deeper AI integration into Search could still present future uncertainty.\nSome commentary around AI driven products, like travel tools and agentic booking in AI Mode, has triggered concern among investors about disruption risk for partners, even though firms like KeyBanc and BTIG argue that markets may be overestimating those risks. This leaves open questions around how these shifts might be received over time.\n\nStory Continues\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts? Perhaps you think there's more to the story. Head to the Simply Wall St Community to discover more perspectives or begin writing your own Narrative!\nWhat's in the News Google is planning a large scale global AI infrastructure buildout, including a US$40b commitment to three Texas data centers through 2027, more than US$15b for a data center hub in India’s Andhra Pradesh with a planned 1 gigawatt hyperscale campus in Visakhapatnam, an AI data center on Australia’s Christmas Island tied to a defense cloud deal, and its largest German investment so far focused on data centers and renewable energy projects.\nAlphabet is pushing deeper into AI chips and models, with reports of a seventh generation Ironwood TPU that is more than 4x faster than the prior version, pitches to place these TPUs inside Meta and large banks’ data centers, and an open sourced Coral NPU IP initiative with VeriSilicon aimed at ultra low energy edge LLM applications.\nGoogle is broadening AI partnerships, including talks around a high tens of billions cloud deal and deeper investment with Anthropic, a reported AI model agreement with Apple to power a revamped Siri using a 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini model at roughly US$1b a year, and an expanded role as cloud and AI provider for the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games and NBCUniversal coverage.\nRegulatory and legal items remain active, with Google ordered to pay €573m in two German antitrust damages cases tied to comparison shopping, an EU probe being prepared into news publisher rankings under the Digital Markets Act, a class action lawsuit over alleged defects in Nest smart home devices, continued scrutiny of the Play Store following the Epic Games antitrust settlement proposal, and a U.S. Supreme Court decision that left parts of an injunction in place. At the same time, Alphabet is pairing its AI and data center expansion with emissions related commitments such as Amazon rainforest restoration via Mombak, a partnership with NextEra to restart Iowa’s Duane Arnold nuclear plant to power AI and cloud operations, and a CO2 removal purchase agreement with Ebb for 3,500 tons using ocean based carbon removal technology.\n\nHow This Changes the Fair Value For Alphabet Fair Value: The analyst fair value estimate has shifted from about US$323.70 to roughly US$330.24 per share.\nDiscount Rate: The applied discount rate is now about 8.24%, compared with 8.26% previously. This reflects a small adjustment in the risk assumption used in the model.\nRevenue Growth: The modelled revenue growth rate is now roughly 13.18%, up from about 12.77%.\nNet Profit Margin: The assumed net profit margin remains broadly similar, moving from about 30.12% to around 30.10%.\nFuture P/E: The future P/E assumption has shifted slightly higher, from about 28.88x to roughly 29.14x.\n\n🔔 Never Miss an Update: Follow The Narrative Narratives on Simply Wall St let you connect the story you see for a company with the numbers behind it.

      "Content": "Apple (AAPL) continues to draw attention from investors as recent returns have been mixed, with a 1 day decline of 0.3%, a 1 week decline of 1.0% and a past month decline of 2.8%.\nSee our latest analysis for Apple.\nAt a share price of US$271.01, Apple’s recent 1 month share price decline sits against a 90 day share price return of 5.7%. Its 1 year total shareholder return of 11.1% and 3 year total shareholder return a little above a doubling highlight that long term holders have seen stronger results than recent momentum implies.\n\nIf Apple’s recent pullback has you reassessing the tech space, this can be a useful moment to scan high growth tech and AI stocks that may fit your return and risk preferences.\nWith Apple trading at US$271.01 and sitting at a small discount to some analyst targets but a premium to certain intrinsic estimates, the key question is whether this recent softness signals a buying opportunity or if the market is already pricing in future growth.\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 5.4% Undervalued With Apple last closing at US$271.01 and the most followed narrative pointing to fair value around US$287, the gap comes down to how you see future earnings power and margins.\nIntroduction and integration of AI-powered features (Apple Intelligence) across devices and platforms, leveraging proprietary silicon, is expected to drive a new upgrade cycle and enhance device differentiation, supporting higher ASPs, sustained product revenue growth, and cost efficiencies that improve gross margins and earnings.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious what kind of revenue pace, profit margin profile, and future P/E multiple are baked into that valuation gap? The full narrative lays out a detailed earnings path and the implied pricing power behind it.\nResult: Fair Value of $287 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, you still need to weigh regulatory pressure on the App Store, as well as tariffs or supply chain disruptions, which could affect Apple’s margins and earnings power.\nFind out about the key risks to this Apple narrative.\nAnother View: When Fair Value Signals Diverge While the consensus narrative sits around a fair value of roughly US$287 and describes Apple as undervalued by about 5.4%, the SWS DCF model presents a different result. On that approach, fair value is US$223.60, which would put today’s US$271.01 share price in overvalued territory.\nThis gap depends on what you think Apple can earn and how long it can sustain those margins. If the cash flow path built into the DCF seems too cautious to you, the narrative fair value may be more in line with your view. If it seems closer to your expectations, it may be worth asking whether the current price gives you enough room for error.\n\nStory Continues\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out Apple for example ).

      "Content": "TSM\n\nGoldman Sachs just dropped its biggest AI-driven calls so far this year, as it lifted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s stock price target in a big way.\nThe bank bumped its Taiwan-listed target to NT$2,330 from NT$1,720 , a move that may seem relatively modest until you do the math.\nTSMC’s U.S.-listed ADR represents five Taiwan shares, which equate to an ADR target of roughly $370–$375 , representing a 35% increase compared to Goldman’s previous call. With TSMC stock trading near $319.61 , that suggests a potential 16% to 17% upside .\n\nAfter years of covering semiconductor cycles, a move this aggressive often suggests the bottleneck is becoming tougher to ignore.\nMr. Market is clearly upbeat about its potential to surprise in 2026, having risen almost 10% in the past month, while the S&P 500 has remained largely unchanged.\nThe primary reason for this is TSMC; AI demand is growing well beyond current expectations, and with it powering the infrastructure behind it, there’s still a lot to be excited about with the stock.\nGoldman Sachs thinks TSMC’s AI run is just getting started Goldman Sachs’ aggressive take rests on the premise that AI is a multi-year growth engine for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , effectively reshaping demand, pricing, and margins.\nAnalyst Bruce Lu argues that demand for AI “tokens” is growing at an exponential pace, keeping advanced-chip demand ahead of supply. That imbalance gives TSMC significant leverage, even as it spends heavily to expand its capacity.\n\nLu feels that 2026 is a year set to be “all about AI.”\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\nDespite three consecutive years of eye-popping investment, he sees margins rising as new fabs come online and boost productivity.\nIn particular, the tight capacity at TSMC’s most advanced 3nm and 5nm nodes will persist through 2027.\nThe TSMC numbers are tough to ignore: Earnings outlook: Lu has bumped his 2026 and 2027 EPS estimates by 9% to 15% , with earnings per share expected to reach NT$100 ($3.20) by 2027 .\nGrowth expectations: Sales are projected to increase by 30% in 2026 and 28% in 2027 , representing a substantial rise from prior forecasts of 22% in both years.\nInvestment and margins: TSMC is expected to spend more than $150 billion in capex from 2026-2028 , including $54 billion in 2027 (gross margins above 60%).\n\nStory Continues\nInside the AI bottleneck that’s working in TSMC’s favor TSMC has effectively become the toll booth of the AI supply chain , performing remarkably better than the broader tech space.\nThe receipts back that up.\nFor perspective, in Q3 2025, TSMC reported $33.1 billion in sales for its high-performance computing platform, accounting for 57% of sales, compared to 30% from smartphones .\n\nRelated: Veteran analyst delivers blunt 3-word take on Tesla after report\nPerhaps an even more telling statistic is that 74% of wafer sales came from 7nm-and-below , along with 23% from 3nm (the go-to for AI chips).\nMoreover, demand remains as robust as ever.\nThe company said it continues to see healthy demand for AI-related products, while updating its full-year sales forecast to close near the mid-30% range .\nThe AI giant is also maintaining a capital expenditure (capex) level of $40 to $42 billion .\nImportantly, 10% to 20% of that spending is earmarked for advanced packaging, testing, and masks, the unglamorous plumbing that is mission-critical for GPUs to ship on time.\nThat plumbing is imperative because advanced packaging, particularly TSMC’s method CoWoS, remains the key choke point for the industry.\n\nAs we look ahead, CoWoS capacity is expected to continue growing, with Bernstein estimating that TSMC’s capacity will increase to 125,000 wafers per month by the end of 2026 , Investing.com reports.\nDespite the impressive ramp-up, giants like Nvidia are blunt in saying that packaging constraints are likely to persist.\nA technical signal that traders rarely ignore is flashing on TSM stock Another pertinent bullish take comes from TheStreet Pro’s veteran analyst and trader Stephen Guilfoyle , nicknamed “The Sarge.”\nPut simply, Guilfoyle lays out the case that TSM stock has moved from a consolidation period into a renewed uptrend.\nHis core argument centers on the formation of a bullish “ inverted head-and-shoulders ” pattern, indicating that the stock spent months building a foundation, pushing back above key levels that traders are closely monitoring.\n\nTSM has reclaimed both the short-term and medium-term moving averages, indicating that buyers are in control and momentum is building without triggering “overbought” warnings.\nThis sets the stage for more upside, as Guilfoyle explains.\nBased on that technical backdrop, he assigns an even higher price target of $377 on TSM stock, arguing its current strength reflects improving fundamentals .\nRelated: Top analyst resets price target on Micron stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 5, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Key Points Nvidia will outperform most of its peers in 2026.\nNvidia's revenue growth will accelerate into the next year.\nNvidia will become the first $6 trillion company.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just wrapped up another impressive year, rising 39%. Any investor is happy with those results, but 2025 is over; what will 2026 bring? I think investors have plenty of reasons to be excited about Nvidia's stock heading into 2026, as the AI buildout is still gaining momentum. This bodes well for Nvidia, and I think it's a top stock to buy for 2026.\nI've got three bolt predictions surrounding Nvidia's stock, and I think each of these will cause it to be one of the best stocks to own in the market.\n1. Nvidia will be the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock The \" Magnificent Seven \" cohort of stocks describes seven of the largest and most dominant tech companies in the market. It includes: Nvidia, Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla .\nEach of these companies is a heavy hitter in the tech realm, and becoming the top performer out of all seven of these is no easy task. In 2025, Alphabet took the crown as the best performer, rising 65% for the year, while Nvidia came in second place. However, I think Nvidia's 2026 performance will be even greater than 2025's as its revenue is accelerating to wrap up the year.\n\nIn the company's second quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia's revenue growth was 56%. In Q3, that figure rose to 62%. Wall Street analysts expect 67% growth in the fourth quarter. That's impressive growth acceleration from the world's largest company, but there are some more catalysts upcoming in 2026 that could increase Nvidia's growth rate.\n2. Nvidia will top $350 billion in revenue in 2026 Nvidia is launching its new architecture in 2026, known as Rubin. While Rubin's improvements over Blackwell are impressive, they require an 800-volt infrastructure, which will require data centers to update their setup, which Nvidia also sells. That will provide a huge revenue boost for Nvidia throughout 2026.\n\nAnother factor is Nvidia's return to China. Nvidia got approval from the U.S. to start selling its China-specific graphics processing units (GPUs) again, but must pay a 25% tax on each one it sells. While it remains to be seen if Nvidia will pass along this price hike to its customers or if it will eat the cost, it will drive further revenue increases. It also remains to be seen if Beijing will allow the sales.\n\nStory Continues\nFor FY 2027 (ending January 2027), the average Wall Street analyst expects $320 billion in revenue, up from an estimated $213 billion in FY 2026. However, Nvidia consistently outperforms expectations and has several massive growth trends that analysts may not fully appreciate. As a result, I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia's revenue tops $350 billion next year, indicating a 64% growth rate from FY 2026's projected levels.\n\n3. Nvidia will surpass the $6 trillion market cap level Currently, Nvidia's market cap is about $4.6 trillion. However, if Nvidia achieves $350 billion in revenue at its current 53% profit margin, that would result in $186 billion in profits. Nvidia's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 46. If we decrease that premium to 35 times earnings at $186 billion in profits, that results in a $6.5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe rise from a $4.6 trillion market cap to a $6.5 trillion one results in a stock gain of about 41%. That's a better year than in 2025, and will result in market-crushing returns if it pans out. That makes Nvidia a solid buy again in 2026, and investors should take the opportunity now to load up on Nvidia's stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nKey Points Demand for Broadcom's specialized semiconductors is driving its stock.\nWall Street analysts expect monster revenue growth in 2026 and 2027.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nFew companies had as successful a 2025 as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . The stock rose an impressive 50%, but there could be plenty of room to run with the industry that it's in.\n\nWhile Broadcom has a wide product lineup, investors are most excited about one thing: custom artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips. In the right application, these can outperform the best products from Nvidia at a lower price point.\nThat's an extremely attractive proposition, and is one that more companies are starting to explore. But does that make Broadcom one of the best AI stocks for 2026?\nBroadcom's growth could be impressive in 2026 Looking at Broadcom's company-wide performance doesn't yield such impressive results. In its fiscal 2025's fourth quarter (ended Nov. 2), revenue rose 28% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 37%. Those are solid results, but other companies in the big tech realm are putting up as good or better numbers.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's custom AI chips are buried underneath these results and are expected to deliver outsized returns in 2026 and beyond. Of the $18 billion that Broadcom generated in the quarter , AI semiconductor revenue made up $6.5 billion of it. This division grew at a blistering-fast pace of 74% year over year. For comparison, Nvidia's latest quarter (ended Oct. 26) saw data center growth of 66% year over year. This means that Broadcom's AI-focused division is growing faster than Nvidia's, showcasing the huge demand for its services.\nBut that growth isn't over. For Q1, they expect AI semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion -- more than double what it generated last year. The fact that Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue is ramping up so quickly showcases the huge demand for its products. But why are they so popular?\n\nASIC chips will continue to grow in popularity Most companies don't have the expertise needed to design their own chip. While they may be able to outline how they want the chip to operate, designing a chip for production is a whole different skill set. That's where Broadcom comes in.\nBroadcom's expertise, combined with its clients' design, yields a potent combination that can produce a chip that outperforms broader-use chips like graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. These chips are known as ASICs, application-specific integrated circuits. ASICs can't handle a wide variety of workloads like GPUs can, but when a workload is configured properly, an ASIC can deliver better performance at a lower price point.\n\nStory Continues\nThe most prominent example of an ASIC success is Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The TPU has been Alphabet's secret weapon to catch up in the generative AI realm, and there is even the possibility that Alphabet will begin selling these to other companies. However, the success of the TPU has also driven many companies to Broadcom, and many AI businesses, like OpenAI, are planning on launching their own chip in the near future.\n\nThat's why Broadcom is expected to grow so much in the next few years. In its fiscal 2025, Broadcom's revenue totaled $63.9 billion, up 24% year over year. For fiscal 2026, the average estimate of 42 Wall Street analysts indicates 50% revenue growth to $96 billion. In fiscal 2027, its revenue growth is projected to be 36%, with $130 billion in revenue.\nThat's a huge growth explosion, and it can all be traced back to ASICs becoming a huge part of many companies' artificial intelligence strategies. As a result, I think Broadcom is an excellent stock to buy now and hold throughout 2026 and beyond. Broadcom has a ton of momentum in its business, and the only thing that will stop it is if AI hyperscalers decide to quit spending money on data centers, which I don't see happening anytime soon.\n\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-groq-deal-meet-other-181038844.html",
      "Content": "GROQ.PVT\n\nINTC\n\nCESY.PVT\n\nNvidia dropped a surprise announcement on Christmas Eve: a $20 billion deal to license AI chip startup Groq’s technology and bring over most of its team, including cofounder and CEO Jonathan Ross. It was a move that hinted Nvidia is no longer assuming its GPUs will not be the only chips useful for the next big phase of AI deployment: running already trained AI models to do everything from answering queries and generating code to analyzing an image—a process known as inference—and doing so at a huge scale.\n\nThe Groq deal bolsters the standing of other startups building their own AI chips, including Cerebras, D-Matrix, and SambaNova—which Intel has reportedly signed a term sheet to acquire—as well as newer players like U.K.-based chip startup Fractile. It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.\nKarl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI Research, pointed to the Microsoft-backed D-Matrix, which raised $275 million last month at a $2 billion valuation. Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models. “I’m sure D-Matrix is a pretty happy startup right now,” Freund said. “I suspect their next round will be at a much higher valuation.”\n\nCerebras, another inference-focused chip company, also appears well positioned. Known for its dinner-plate-sized &#8220;wafer-scale&#8221; chip designed to run extremely large models on a single piece of silicon, Cerebras has filed for an IPO after a previous delay. Freund said the company has increasingly been viewed as a potential acquisition target as well. “You don’t want to wait until after the IPO, when it’s more expensive,” he said. “From that perspective, Cerebras is sitting pretty right now.”\nNvidia-Groq deal has clarified market&#8217;s direction Executives at these companies say Nvidia’s move has helped clarify the market’s direction. “When [the Nvidia-Groq deal] happened, we said, ‘Finally, the market recognizes it,’” Sid Sheth, CEO of D-Matrix, told Fortune . “I think what Nvidia has really done is they said, Okay, this approach is a winning approach.”\n\nAnd Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman posted on X that, in the past, the perception that Nvidia GPUs were all you needed for AI acted as a moat, keeping AI chip startups for nibbling away at Nvidia&#8217;s marketshare. But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote. “It reflects a growing industry reality—the inference market is fragmenting, and a new category has emerged where speed isn&#8217;t a feature—it&#8217;s the entire value proposition. A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.”\n\nStory Continues\nStill, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally. Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said the chip sector remains a difficult one for venture investors, given the high capital requirements and long timelines. “A lot of VCs stopped investing in chips 10 or 15 years ago,” Murphy said. “It’s capital-intensive, it takes years to get a product out, and the outcomes are hard to predict.”\n\nThat said, he pointed to Fireworks, and AI inference platform which raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October, as a startup with a technical advantage, thanks to a founding team filled with engineers who built Pytorch an. But he added that it remains unclear how much of the current enthusiasm reflects genuine technical differentiation. “it&#8217;s hard to tell who&#8217;s really got something significant versus the tide is [raising] all boats, which is what seems to be going on,” he said, adding that consolidation across the sector now appears increasingly likely.\nNew entrant seeks true disruption But at least one veteran of the AI hardware world argues that even today’s inference-focused startups are not truly disruptive.\nNaveen Rao, former SVP of AI at Databricks and founder of MosaicML, recently left Databricks to start Unconventional AI, which last month confirmed a massive $475 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures. His critique: companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.\n\nAfter Nvidia’s Groq deal validated demand for faster, more efficient inference, startups that fit neatly into today’s AI stack suddenly look far more valuable — not because they reinvented computing, Rao argues, but because they work within it. Unconventional AI is pursuing a more radical path: building new hardware that exploits the physical behavior of silicon itself, and redesigning neural networks to match it.\n“We&#8217;ve been building the same fundamental machine for 80 years, a numeric digital machine,” he said. “But there was never one workload that dominated even more than 2% of all compute cycles.” That is changing, he explained: In a few years, 95% of all compute will be used for AI.\nFrom that standpoint, it’s important to construct an entirely different machine than what is built today, he said. However, Rao says the effort could take five years or more to bear fruit — and is not intended to capitalize on the current inference boom.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "Content": "NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nCRWV\n\nSSNLF\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares climbed by the most since April, as the world’s largest contract chipmaker rides a continued wave of optimism over artificial intelligence demand into the new year.\nShares of the key supplier to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. jumped as much as 6.9% to touch a new record high in Taipei. That came after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its TSMC price target 35% to NT$2,330, citing expectations of another year of solid growth. The company’s US depositary receipts were up 1.7% in New York trading on Monday. Tech stocks across Asia and the US also gained, including Samsung Electronics Co., Intel Corp., Arm Holdings Plc and CoreWeave Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinkholes and Quake-Hit Roads Expose Japan’s Infrastructure Emergency\nInvestors are plowing cash into AI bets despite recent concerns about a bubble. The sector was once again the biggest boost for equities in Asia as the fear of missing out overcame concerns about short-term volatility due to the US-Venezuela conflict.\n“We view AI as a multi-year growth engine for TSMC,” Goldman analysts including Bruce Lu wrote in a report. Lu noted the company’s profit margins are improving, even as he projected it will spend $150 billion over the next three years to increase capacity.\nAmong other chip stocks, South Korea’s Samsung extended gains to a fifth-straight session. The company is expected to report preliminary results later this week that will provide further clues on whether earnings justify the sector’s big gains.\nElsewhere, shares of Japanese equipment makers Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. advanced more than 7% each Monday. Chinese chip stocks gained after the nation’s integrated circuit investment fund raised its stake in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., and DeepSeek flagged a more efficient approach to training AI.\n\nTSMC helped drive Taiwan’s Taiex up more than 3% to a record of over 30,000, a level that “seemed almost impossible” until recently, according to Juan Ching-hwa, Taiwan’s deputy finance minister. Still, given the chipmaker’s dominance there are “hopes for a more balanced structure,” he told lawmakers Monday.\nThe Hsinchu-based firm’s shares surged 44% in 2025, pushing its market value above $1 trillion for the first time. That reflects increased investor confidence in its central position amid the AI boom, with many of the world’s chip companies relying on its foundry services.\n“For leading-edge semiconductor, capacity from TSMC is the king,” Bernstein analysts including Mark Li wrote in a note dated Friday. This year “is still all about AI,” the analysts said, while recommending investors “focus on quality” given worries of a bubble.\n\nStory Continues\nTSMC is due to report earnings on Jan. 15. Capital market activity may be another near-term catalyst for the sector, especially for Chinese stocks. Around 11 AI-related companies have laid out plans to list in Hong Kong this month, with proceeds of as much as $4.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, valuations are seen supporting Asian shares relative to global peers. A gauge of the region’s tech hardware companies is trading at 16 times forward earnings estimates compared with 25 times for the Nasdaq 100.\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nOzempic Users Actually Spend More Dining Out.

While Google is a ‍major Nvidia customer, its own chips have emerged as one of Nvidia's biggest threats as Google works closely with Meta Platforms and ​others to chip away at Nvidia's AI stronghold.\nAt the ‌same time, Nvidia is eager to show that its latest products can outperform older chips like the H200, which U.S. President Donald Trump has allowed to flow to China. Reuters has reported that the chip, which was the predecessor ⁠to Nvidia's current flagship \"Blackwell\" chip, is ​in high demand in China, ​which has alarmed China hawks across the U.S. political spectrum.\nHuang's speech is scheduled to begin at 4 ‍p.m. EST (2100 ⁠GMT).

      "Content": "INTC\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nLAS VEGAS — Qualcomm ( QCOM ) is continuing to push deeper into the PC market at CES 2026, rolling out its newest entry-level chip for Microsoft ( MSFT ) Windows laptops.\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus joins the company's previously announced Snapdragon X2 Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme processors as part of the company's push to take on longtime PC chip leader Intel ( INTC ) and rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ).\n\nQualcomm is seeking to diversify its portfolio of products to ease its dependence on the smartphone space. The company kicked off its effort at last year's CES with its original Snapdragon X processor.\nThe chip technology developer reported $44.3 billion in total revenue in 2025. Of that amount, $38.4 billion came from its QCT business, which includes sales related to chips for smartphones, PCs, and autos.\nAccording to Qualcomm, the Snapdragon X2 Plus will be available with either a six-core or 10-core CPU and provides up to 35% faster peak performance versus the prior-generation Plus and requires 43% less power.\nThe company is also touting the chips' multiday battery life and built-in neural processing unit, or NPU, which Qualcomm says packs up to 80 trillions of operations per second (TOPS) of performance. TOPS is a general measure of how well a device can run AI apps.\n\n\"Modern professionals and creators want to do more, create more, and push the limits of generative AI and all-day performance. Snapdragon X2 Plus platform delivers the power, efficiency and intelligence to surpass their ambitions, making each experience more responsive and personal,\" Kedar Kondap, Qualcomm's SVP and GM of computing and gaming, said in a statement.\nQualcomm's move into the consumer and business PC space comes as Intel continues its turnaround effort. Once the undisputed leader in the PC chip industry, Intel has been losing market share to AMD.\nBut in October, Intel debuted its Core Ultra Series 3, based on its long-gestating 18A technology, which could help stave off further share deterioration and give Qualcomm and AMD a more difficult fight ahead.\nIn addition to the X2 Plus, Qualcomm unveiled a new robotics initiative at CES 2026, including a drive toward humanoid robots. The company said it believes the market for physical AI, another term for robots, will be worth as much as $1 trillion by 2040, and it's looking to get a piece of that action.\n\nPart of that includes Qualcomm's new Dragonwing IQ10 chip for physical AI systems ranging from industrial robotics to humanoid robots.\nBut Qualcomm isn't the only company looking to make waves in the robotics industry. Nvidia, Intel, AMD, and a host of other chipmakers are aiming to become the go-to firm for physical AI as the technology continues to mature over the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "主播／劉品薇 台北報導\n\n台股今天衝上三萬點大關，台積電股價則飆到1670元再創新天價，讓社群上許多小股民都相當興奮！同時還有網友發文抓包，台大管院副教授邱宏仁去年3月曾在臉書發文，嗆台積電董事長魏哲家對不起台灣，還說未來四年將投入美國設廠，除了會刨掉台灣晶圓代工的根之外，也讓台積電股價震盪中長線探底500元以下。最後更喊話魏哲家必須下台，向台積電股民、跟台灣全民道歉。\n\n這篇是去年3/5的文章，但如今被網友發現這篇文已經無法公開觀看，認為應該是被設為隱藏或直接刪除了，只不過當初發文的內容早就被網友截圖持續在網路上流傳。另外今天還有不少人點名國民黨立委翁曉玲、王鴻薇、葉元之，嘲諷表示恭喜這些申報持有台積電股票的立委。事實上對此民進黨立委林楚茵過去就曾批評，國民黨一邊唱衰台積電、一邊又持續買進，根本兩面手法，只是為反對而反對但想賺的錢一點都不放過。\n\n除此之外，林楚茵稍早也在社群發文，痛批前總統馬英九當年還想要把台積電賣給紫光，好在蔡政府時期守下來才有現在1670元台積電。另外林楚茵也提到，柯文哲2023年參選總統時，曾說如果賴清德當選台灣經濟一定會變差，但如今執政才邁入第二年，台股就已經突破3萬點，同樣狠狠打臉。因此林楚茵今天喊話藍白兩黨是不是應該閉嘴了。\n\n針對今天台股上三萬點，投資專家阿格力也有感而發，一早就發文寫下台股上三萬明明有賺到錢，但總覺得哪裡怪怪的，原來是留言區一片祥和。因為他說自己在去年的時候，每次只要喊台灣尚勇就會立刻遭到網軍攻擊，但不曉得為何今天這麼和平。儘管在留言區還是有網友嗆他說得意忘形下場會很慘，但阿格力也不客氣回酸台股已經得意忘形十幾年了。事實上，不只國內專家看好，外資最新研究報告也將台積電目標價從2100元再上修到2400元，主要看重台積電在2027年的獲利潛力。\n\n同時報告中也提到，無論超微市占提升或輝達需求擴張，都高度仰賴台積電晶圓代工供給，還預計到2028年先進晶圓產能可望翻倍。報告也提到儘管未來還是有大環境需求變化的挑戰，但專家一致認為台積電在半導體界的地位無可取代。以上就今天熱搜，歡迎在yt直播聊天室或影片下方留言，跟我們分享你的想法。\n\n原文出處：午夜特搜：昔唱衰台積電！ 台大副教授悄刪「這篇文」\n\n更多民視新聞報導發送率近97%！942萬份小橘書已到家 全民防衛韌性有感升級挑戰花蓮王！媒體人嗆傅崐萁：民主的恥辱 爭取藍營提名「終結王朝」最有機會奪下高雄市長？「這人」曬民調：我是唯一穩贏藍營的人選",

      "Content": "SSNLF\n\nIn recent months, Alphabet has deepened its role in artificial intelligence, winning the Pentagon’s GenAI.mil contract, integrating its Gemini model across products, expanding TPU partnerships, and agreeing to acquire clean‑energy developer Intersect Power for about US$4.75 billion in cash plus assumed debt to support its fast‑growing AI data center needs.\nThese moves, alongside Google Cloud’s AI‑driven growth, Samsung’s expanded use of Gemini on Galaxy devices, and new monetization paths ranging from TPUs to robotaxis, highlight how Alphabet is turning its broad AI ecosystem into an interconnected commercial platform rather than a single‑product bet.\nWe’ll now examine how Alphabet’s Pentagon-backed GenAI.mil role reframes its investment narrative around AI infrastructure, cloud growth, and long-term spending.\n\nExplore 29 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research.\nAlphabet Investment Narrative Recap To own Alphabet, you need to believe its AI heavy model can keep driving Search, YouTube and Cloud while justifying very high capital spending and intense competition. The Pentagon backed GenAI.mil win and the Intersect Power deal both reinforce the near term AI infrastructure story, but they do not materially change the main catalyst, which is whether Google Cloud and Gemini monetization can offset rising capex and margin pressure, or the key risk of ad and regulatory dependence.\n\nThe Intersect Power acquisition, at about US$4.75 billion in cash plus assumed debt, ties Alphabet’s AI ambitions directly to long dated data center power needs, sitting alongside Google Cloud’s AI driven backlog growth as a core catalyst for how efficiently those record capital expenditures translate into future earnings resilience.\nYet against this progress, investors should also be aware of Alphabet’s record AI focused capex and the margin risk if revenue growth fails to keep pace...\nRead the full narrative on Alphabet (it's free!)\nAlphabet's narrative projects $512.6 billion revenue and $148.4 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Alphabet's forecasts yield a $330.24 fair value , a 5% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Private investors in the Simply Wall St Community have 187 fair value estimates for Alphabet, ranging from US$171.36 to US$340.15, underscoring how far apart individual views can be. Against that backdrop, Alphabet’s record AI driven capital expenditure plans and the question of whether Cloud and Gemini monetization can keep margins healthy give you a concrete lens to compare these different viewpoints.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 187 other fair value estimates on Alphabet - why the stock might be worth as much as 8% more than the current price!\nBuild Your Own Alphabet Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "KLA (KLAC) shares slipped 1.5% after a third quarter that delivered double digit revenue and EPS growth versus expectations, putting the focus on how AI demand and export limits might shape the story from here.\nSee our latest analysis for KLA.\nThat post earnings dip sits against a strong recent run, with KLA’s 90 day share price return of 17.49% and 1 year total shareholder return of 86.20% pointing to momentum that has been building rather than fading.\n\nIf KLA’s AI driven story has your attention, it could be a good moment to see what else is out there in high growth tech and AI stocks .\nWith the shares up 86.20% over the past year and now trading at US$1,274.47, only about 3.6% below the average analyst target, investors may wonder whether there is still an attractive entry point or whether potential future growth is already reflected in the current price.\nMost Popular Narrative: 1.7% Undervalued The most followed narrative pegs KLA’s fair value at about US$1,296.89 per share, a touch above the latest close of US$1,274.47, suggesting only a small valuation gap.\nThe advanced packaging market is experiencing early-stage, secular growth fueled by adoption of 2.5D/3D architectures and HBM, driving KLA's advanced packaging revenue target for 2025 up nearly 80% year-over-year with expectations that this trend is \"closer to the beginning than the end\"; this directly expands KLA's addressable market and should provide multi-year upside to revenue.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious what kind of revenue mix, margin profile, and earnings multiple are built into that fair value? The narrative leans on specific long run assumptions for growth, profitability, and capital intensity. The full story sits in how those pieces fit together.\nResult: Fair Value of $1,296.89 (ABOUT RIGHT)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, that story can wobble if China demand weakens further or if tariffs and higher costs eat into the margin assumptions behind that 1.7% undervaluation.\nFind out about the key risks to this KLA narrative.\nAnother View: Multiples Paint A Richer Picture That 1.7% “about right” fair value story sits awkwardly next to our own P/E based work, which indicates that KLA appears expensive. The shares trade on a 39.5x P/E versus a fair ratio of 29.4x, a gap that suggests there may be less room for disappointment than the narrative implies.\nKLA also trades at a higher multiple than the broader US Semiconductor industry at 37.3x, although it is slightly cheaper than close peers at 41.5x. If market sentiment cools, does the share price move toward that 29.4x fair ratio, or do earnings need to account for more of the adjustment from here?\n\nStory Continues\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own KLA Narrative If you are not fully on board with this story or simply prefer to test the numbers yourself, you can build a fresh KLA view in minutes, starting with Do it your way .\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards investors are optimistic about regarding KLA.\nLooking for more investment ideas?

      "Content": "TMICF\n\n3231.TW\n\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia, January 05, 2026 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Magna AI, a global full-value-chain AI transformation leader established through a partnership between Trend Micro and Wistron, today announced that it has joined the elite ranks of global AI organizations delivering production-scale intelligence as part of the NVIDIA Inception program.\n\nMagna AI’s participation reflects deep technical alignment with NVIDIA ’s AI platforms as part of its ongoing work designing, building, and operating large-scale AI systems that deliver operational intelligence and measurable outcomes for enterprises and governments.

      "Title": "Is Meta Platforms (META) Still Attractive After AI Investment Push And Steady Share Price?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-still-attractive-160700060.html",
      "Content": "If you are wondering whether Meta Platforms at US$650.41 is priced for perfection or still offers value, you are not alone. This article is built to help you frame that question clearly.\nThe share price has been fairly steady over shorter periods, with a 1.3% decline over the last week and a 3.4% decline over the last month. The 1 year return sits at 3.5%, and the 3 year return is very large.\nRecent headlines have continued to focus on Meta's push in areas such as artificial intelligence tools across its apps and ongoing investments in virtual and augmented reality, as well as continued scrutiny of its social platforms from regulators and policymakers. Together, these themes help shape how investors think about both the growth potential and the risks around the current share price.\nOn our checks, Meta Platforms scores 5 out of 6 on valuation, with a value score of 5/6 suggesting the stock screens as undervalued on most metrics. Next, we will look at the usual valuation methods before finishing with a way to think about value that goes beyond any single model.\n\nFind out why Meta Platforms's 3.5% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\nApproach 1: Meta Platforms Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company might be worth today by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to the present using a required rate of return.\nFor Meta Platforms, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow (FCF) is about $58.81b. Using a 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, analysts provide explicit FCF estimates out to 2030, with Simply Wall St extrapolating beyond the initial analyst horizon. On this basis, projected FCF for 2030 is $119.72b, with interim annual projections in between these points.\n\nWhen those expected cash flows are discounted back to today in this model, the estimated intrinsic value for Meta Platforms comes out at about $1,063.23 per share. Compared with the current share price of US$650.41, the DCF output implies the stock screens as around 38.8% undervalued in this framework.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Meta Platforms is undervalued by 38.8%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 870 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Meta Platforms.\nApproach 2: Meta Platforms Price vs Earnings For a profitable business like Meta Platforms, the P/E ratio is a useful shorthand for what the market is willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. It links directly to your experience as a shareholder, because earnings per share are a core input into many valuation frameworks.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat counts as a \"normal\" P/E often reflects how quickly earnings are expected to grow and how much risk investors see in those earnings. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.\nMeta Platforms currently trades on a P/E of 28.01x. That is above the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 15.45x, but below the peer group average of 34.93x. Simply Wall St also estimates a proprietary Fair Ratio for Meta of 39.09x, which is the P/E level they would expect given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk profile.\n\nThe Fair Ratio can be more useful than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for Meta's specific characteristics rather than treating all companies as if they were the same. Compared with the current 28.01x P/E, the Fair Ratio of 39.09x indicates that the shares appear undervalued on this metric.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1462 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Meta Platforms Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This is a simple tool on Simply Wall St's Community page where you connect your view of Meta Platforms, including future revenue, earnings and margins, to a financial forecast and a fair value. You can then compare that fair value to the current share price to help you decide what action makes sense. The Narrative updates automatically as new news or earnings arrive, and different investors can express very different stories, such as one Narrative using a fair value of US$538.09 and another using US$837.15 for the same Meta stock.\n\nFor Meta Platforms however we will make it straightforward, with previews of two leading Meta Platforms Narratives:\n🐂 Meta Platforms Bull Case\nFair value used in this bullish Narrative: US$837.15 per share\nImplied discount to this fair value at US$650.41: about 22.3% undervalued\nRevenue growth assumption: 16.67% a year\nAI driven ad targeting, messaging monetization and a broad social and commerce ecosystem are expected to support durable revenue growth and high engagement across Meta's platforms.\nHeavy investment in AI infrastructure and Reality Labs is treated as a long term enabler of scale, with analysts building in higher revenue and substantial earnings by 2028.\nKey risks include rising capex and operating expenses, ongoing Reality Labs losses and regulatory pressure, which could weigh on margins if revenue does not keep pace.\n\n🐻 Meta Platforms Bear Case\nFair value used in this more cautious Narrative: US$538.09 per share\nImplied premium to this fair value at US$650.41: about 20.9% overvalued\nRevenue growth assumption: 10.5% a year\nMeta is expected to keep a strong position in social media, AI and AR or VR, but the author sees a limit to how much of that is already reflected in the share price.\nThe thesis relies on continued ARPU growth, AR or VR adoption and cost cutting, while acknowledging large ongoing losses in Reality Labs and high AI capex commitments.\nRegulation, ad market dependence, execution risk in the metaverse and cybersecurity concerns feature as central risks that could restrain earnings and the valuation multiple.\nPutting these side by side gives you a practical range of outcomes, from a bullish fair value of about US$837 to a more conservative US$538, so you can decide which set of assumptions feels closer to your own view of Meta's future.\nCurious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

While Hewlett Packard is up 5.7%, Broadcom has surged 47% over this period.\nOne-Year QCOM Stock Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQCOM Plagued by Waning Margins A combination of factors has led to a placid performance by the chip-manufacturing firm. Qualcomm's margins have declined over the years due to high operating expenses and R&D (research & development) costs. The company expects softness in the handset market and a weaker overall mix of devices to continue in the near future. The shift in the share among original equipment manufacturers at the premium tier has reduced the near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from the Snapdragon platform.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm faces stiff competitive pressures from rivals Broadcom and Hewlett Packard. Aggressive competition from low-cost chip manufacturers and established players in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum over the next three to four years, a major portion of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may weigh on Qualcomm's margins.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBitter U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Ties Hurt QCOM Moreover, Qualcomm is expected to face softness in demand from China. The chip-making firm has a significant presence in more than 12 cities in China, aiming to drive advancements in semiconductors and mobile telecommunications for the larger benefit. The company has been a key supplier of chips and other related components to local smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Huawei and its spin-off brand Honor. However, it appears that Qualcomm is increasingly finding it difficult to maintain its operations in the communist nation due to the continued U.S.-China trade spat.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department has long imposed various trade restrictions against China that banned the sale of high-tech equipment, chips, components and related technology to develop high-end smartphones and AI-enabled chips. As Washington tightens trade restrictions, Beijing has intensified its push for self-sufficiency in critical industries. This shift poses a dual challenge for QCOM, as it faces potential market restrictions and increased competition from domestic chipmakers. In addition, weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, resulted in elevated customer inventory levels.\n\nStory Continues\nQCOM Buoyed by Snapdragon, AI & Automotive Businesses Despite the short-term headwinds, Qualcomm is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. The company is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. In addition, the chip manufacturer envisions solid growth opportunities within the mobile space, driven by the strength of its Snapdragon portfolio.\n\nLeveraging processors with multi-core CPUs with cutting-edge features, amazing graphics and worldwide network connectivity, Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platforms are fast with superb power efficiency. Smartphones and mobile devices built with Snapdragon mobile platforms enable immersive augmented reality and virtual reality experiences, brilliant camera capabilities, superior 4G LTE and 5G connectivity with state-of-the-art security solutions.\n\nQualcomm is currently foraying deeper into the realm of AI capabilities within the laptop and desktop business with the launch of the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops. The strategy is aimed at moving beyond the slowing smartphone industry, which is its primary breadwinner. In addition to diversifying its revenue stream, this is likely to further extend QCOM’s AI footprint.\n\nIt has completed the acquisition of U.K.-based chip firm Alphawave Semi for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion. The buyout offers Qualcomm an opportunity to expand its presence in high-growth applications, including data centers, AI, data networking and data storage.\n\nThe automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and C-V2X solutions are fueling emerging automotive industry trends such as the growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification. Qualcomm is gradually gaining traction in the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems market with the buyout of Autotalks. With seamless access to Autotalks’ comprehensive V2X expertise, Qualcomm has been able to offer an extensive suite of automotive-qualified global V2X solutions for installation in vehicles, as well as 2-wheelers and roadside infrastructure. The company’s V2X chipsets offer production-ready standalone solutions that are purpose-built for global applications, resulting in direct communication becoming more pervasive.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend for QCOM Earnings estimates for Qualcomm for fiscal 2026 have moved down 1.4% to $12.15 over the past year, while the same for fiscal 2026 has declined 2.1% to $12.58. The downward estimate revision depicts that investors are bearish about the growth potential for the stock.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEnd Note With robust automotive and Snapdragon traction, Qualcomm appears to be relatively better placed in terms of its portfolio strength. A strong emphasis on quality, diligent execution of operational plans and continuous portfolio enhancements are driving more value for customers. With downward earnings estimate revisions, the stock is witnessing negative investor sentiment.\n\nMoreover, stiff competition and softness in key end markets are likely to put pressure on the bottom-line growth. High R&D costs erode its profitability to a large extent. Qualcomm is facing a tough operating environment in China amid escalating tariffs, raising questions about its long-term viability plans in the communist country. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Qualcomm appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-ev-deliveries-slide-2025-153400572.html",
      "Content": "BYDDF\n\nBYDDY\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla TSLA saw its annual deliveries decline for the second consecutive year in 2025. After deliveries declined in the first and second quarters of 2025, Tesla set a new delivery record in the third quarter, but much of it came from buyers rushing to claim the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit. Expiration of incentives, intense competition from Chinese EV makers, particularly BYD Co Ltd BYDDY, and an aging fleet resulted in the year-over-year decline in Tesla deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as the full year.\n\nWhile TSLA’s core EV business is struggling, CEO Elon Musk is pinning big hopes on autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, considering those as the next fuel engines for the company. However, meaningful revenues from these projects are years away.\nSo, in this scenario, should investors dump Tesla stock or still hold it tight on big long-term promises? Before that, let's dig deeper into TSLA’s latest delivery numbers.\nTSLA Q4 & Full-Year Deliveries Disappoint In the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla sold 418,227 vehicles (comprising 406,585 Model 3/Y and 11,642 other models), down 16% from the corresponding quarter of 2024. For the full year, deliveries totaled roughly 1.64 million vehicles (comprising 1.58 million units of Model 3/Y and 50,850 other models). That denotes a decline from nearly 1.8 million vehicles sold in 2024.\n\nAnother thing to be noticed here is that the rate of sales decline has also increased in 2025. In 2024, deliveries were down 1% on a year-over-year basis. In 2025, the year-over-year decline was more than 8%.\nAnd with that, Tesla lost its EV crown to BYD, which overthrew Tesla for the first time on an annual basis. BYD logged record sales of 2.26 million BEVs in 2025, reflecting a 28% increase year over year.\nMusk’s Pivot to Robotaxis & Robotics Musk is betting big on Full Self-Driving (FSD) and robotaxis, calling them Tesla’s most valuable future segment. Its robotaxi service, launched in June, is currently operational in Austin and San Francisco, with Phoenix next after the company recently secured the required permits. Tesla has also outlined plans to expand into Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston and Miami. Notably, Tesla’s FSD fleet has surpassed 7 billion total miles.\nAlso, Tesla has started testing driverless robotaxis without safety monitors, which investors see as proof of progress toward autonomous mobility. Musk has also announced that Tesla’s in-car systems will integrate Grok, an AI chatbot, boosting confidence in Tesla’s ability to monetize AI.\n\nStory Continues\nThat said, competition in autonomy remains intense. Alphabet ’s GOOGL Waymo continues to lead the autonomous ride-hailing race. Its entire fleet operates without safety drivers, and it recently surpassed 450,000 weekly paid rides. So, Tesla is still playing catch-up in the AV space.\nRegarding robotics, Tesla’s humanoid robot project, Optimus, is seen as a long-term growth driver, adding to the narrative that Tesla is more than just an EV company.\n\nFlourishing Energy Business One key bright spot for the company is its Energy Generation and Storage business, which is going strong on the back of the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products. This segment also stands out as Tesla's most lucrative, boasting the highest margins. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed a record 14.2 GWh of energy storage products. For the full year, deployments rose 48.7% to 46.7 GWh.\n\nTSLA’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Over the past year, Tesla shares have underperformed the industry.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company trades at more than 13.75X forward 12-month sales, far above the industry average. But Tesla has been one of those stocks whose valuation has long been divorced from its fundamentals. It has always traded at a premium, backed by promises of its long-term potential.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s 2025 revenues and EPS implies a year-over-year contraction of 3% and 33%, respectively. But the consensus mark for 2026 top and bottom lines suggests an improvement of 11.6% and 42.4%, respectively, from the 2025 projected levels. See how TSLA’s EPS estimates have been revised over the past 90 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla Shares Worth Holding Onto Now Tesla’s delivery slowdown highlights the growing pressure on its core EV business. But Tesla is not just an EV story now. While vehicle demand faces competition and incentive-related volatility, the company continues to make steady progress in full self-driving, robotaxis, and energy storage—areas that could reshape its long-term earnings mix. At the same time, ambitions around AI and humanoid robotics offer optionality that a few automakers can match, even if monetization remains years away.\n\nThat said, investors should temper expectations. Scaling robotaxis beyond pilot programs and turning AI-led projects into consistent revenue streams will take time.\nFor now, Tesla is a high-risk, high-reward stock. Long-term believers should stay invested, but fresh entry points may warrant patience. And if even part of Musk’s vision comes together, TSLA could remain a winning stock for years to come.\nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "TFC\n\nIntel’s fair value estimate has inched up from about US$37.27 to about US$38.14 per share, with a slightly higher discount rate of about 11.53% now applied to a modestly improved revenue growth outlook of about 5.60%. This reflects research that reads as cautiously optimistic, with cleaner recent quarters, better demand signals, and early foundry progress prompting analysts to lift their models while still openly flagging execution risks and an uncertain recovery path. Stay tuned as we unpack what is driving these model tweaks today and how you can keep on top of the evolving Intel narrative from here.\n\nStay updated as the Fair Value for Intel shifts by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\nWhat Wall Street Has Been Saying 🐂 Bullish Takeaways\nSeveral firms see Intel making tangible progress on execution, with Truist and TD Cowen both pointing to cleaner quarterly results, clearer AI messaging, better demand signals, and improving foundry datapoints as reasons to lift their models.\nTruist raised its price target to US$39 from US$21 and TD Cowen moved to US$38 from US$35, framing Intel as delivering positive updates while still treating the recovery as a work in progress rather than a completed turnaround.\nMorgan Stanley increased its price target to US$36 from US$23 after adjusting its revenue and non GAAP EPS estimates higher and citing more optimism around the foundry opportunity, even as it keeps an Equal Weight stance.\nWells Fargo highlights intensifying competition in AI accelerators, mentioning Intel alongside Qualcomm, AMD and Nvidia. This keeps Intel in the conversation for data center and AI workloads even if the focus of that particular note is on Qualcomm.\nRaymond James resumes coverage at Market Perform, pointing to a stronger balance sheet and new management as reasons for some confidence. It also describes its sum of the parts work as consistent with a fair value view at current levels.\n\n🐻 Bearish Takeaways\nValuation is a recurring concern, with Raymond James flagging that Intel shares trade well above median historic earnings multiples and that its sum of the parts analysis points to pricing that already reflects a fair value outcome.\nHSBC takes the most cautious stance, downgrading Intel to Reduce from Hold with a higher price target of US$24, and calling the recent share rally overdone after a strong move since a series of government and partner deals.\nHSBC and others keep the focus on execution risk, especially in Intel’s own fabs, arguing that any sustained recovery still depends heavily on how well the company delivers on its manufacturing roadmap and potential technology agreements.\nTD Cowen, despite a higher target, cuts its 2026 estimates materially and highlights gross margin headwinds and Altera deconsolidation as factors that could make it harder for fundamentals to catch up with the stock.\nWedbush, which lifted its target only slightly to US$20 from US$19, explicitly struggles to justify the recent valuation rerating and keeps a Neutral view. This shows that a portion of the Street sees limited upside until Intel’s results build a longer track record of improvement.\n\nStory Continues\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts? Perhaps you think there's more to the story. Head to the Simply Wall St Community to discover more perspectives or begin writing your own Narrative!\nWhat's in the News Intel and CEO Lip Bu Tan publicly rejected concerns that a recent senior hire from TSMC brought over trade secrets, reiterating the company’s policies against using third party intellectual property and describing the allegations as rumor and speculation, according to Bloomberg.\nTSMC filed a lawsuit in Taiwan against former senior vice president Wei Jen Lo, who recently joined Intel, citing non compete and trade secret concerns and alleging a high probability of confidential information being transferred to Intel, according to Reuters.\nMedia reports suggest Intel is in ongoing talks and is seen by some outlets as on track to acquire AI chip startup SambaNova Systems, which sells AI racks for data centers and already counts Intel Capital and SoftBank as investors, although no deal is confirmed and other buyers could still emerge.\nIntel previewed its Panther Lake Intel Core Ultra series 3 processors and Clearwater Forest Xeon 6+ server chips built on the 18A manufacturing node. Panther Lake is already in production, with broad market availability targeted from January 2026. Xeon 6+ is planned for launch in the first half of 2026. Intel also issued Q4 2025 guidance calling for revenue of US$12.8b to US$13.8b and a diluted loss per share attributable to Intel of US$0.14.\n\nHow This Changes the Fair Value For Intel The Fair Value Estimate has risen slightly from about US$37.27 to about US$38.14 per share, reflecting a modest uplift in the base case.\nThe Discount Rate has edged up from about 11.46% to about 11.53%, which implies a slightly higher required return in the updated model.\nThe Revenue Growth assumption has moved fractionally higher from about 5.56% to about 5.60%.\nThe Net Profit Margin assumption has ticked up from about 9.86% to about 9.91%.\nThe Future P/E has risen slightly from about 48.64x to about 49.57x, which indicates a modestly higher valuation multiple in the model.\n\n🔔 Never Miss an Update: Follow The Narrative Narratives on Simply Wall St let you connect Intel’s story to the numbers in one place, by setting out your view on its business, linking that to forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and then to a fair value.

      "Content": "Key Points Apple's Vision Pro headset is selling poorly, according to IDC.\nThis has prompted the company to slash production and marketing spending.\nApple's search for a post-iPhone blockbuster continues.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\nWhen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) launched the first iteration of its Vision Pro headset in early 2024, the tech giant declared that \"the era of spatial computing is here.\" Nearly two years later, it's become clear that Apple badly misjudged demand for its heavy, expensive headset.\nThe Financial Times recently reported that Apple has been cutting Vision Pro production and marketing in response to weak sales. Apple doesn't report Vision Pro sales figures, but IDC expects the company to ship just 45,000 Vision Pro units in the final quarter of 2025. Even with a $3,499 price tag, revenue from the Vision Pro is immaterial for Apple if IDC's estimates are accurate.\n\nWhile it's not clear whether Apple is entirely giving up on the Vision Pro, the company's long search for a product that can achieve the same success as the iPhone continues.\nThe iPhone is still the king Much of Apple's business is tied to the iPhone. In fiscal 2025, a bit more than half of Apple's total revenue came from iPhone sales, which totaled $201 billion. Wearables and other accessories churned up $37 billion in revenue, but the popular Apple Watch requires an iPhone for full functionality.\n\nServices is Apple's second-largest segment, with revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2025. However, much of that revenue is at least somewhat dependent on the iPhone as well. A deal with Alphabet that generates around $20 billion for Apple annually, making Google the default search engine on Apple devices, doesn't exist without the iPhone. Neither does all the revenue Apple generates from the App Store or any other services that are deeply integrated with Apple's devices.\nThe iPhone remains a juggernaut, but there will eventually come a day when the smartphone will be supplanted by something new. It may be some sort of augmented reality glasses, or potentially a new hardware form that hasn't yet been invented. The Vision Pro certainly isn't it.\n\nApple is starting to look like a classic case of The Innovator's Dilemma , a phrase coined by Clayton Chirstenson decades ago. Apple is heavily dependent on the iPhone, and nearly everything it does ultimately attempts to protect that product. Even the Vision Pro needs an iPhone for some features, including making calls.\nThis makes sense in the near term, given the profitability of the iPhone. However, it also means that Apple is unlikely to be the company that develops the next big thing. For that, Apple would need to disrupt itself and the iPhone, and there's no reason to believe the company is willing to take enough risk for that to happen.\n\nStory Continues\nApple stock is looking pricey Apple is valued at around $4 trillion, which translates to a price-to-earnings ratio based on the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2026 of roughly 33. Sales growth is expected to be in the single-digit percentage range this year and next, while earnings-per-share growth is likely to receive a boost from share buybacks.\n\nIs Apple stock attractive at this price? I'd argue that it's not. There's only so much juice to squeeze from the iPhone business, and Apple is no closer today than it was 5 years ago to having a post-iPhone blockbuster product. Apple is risk-averse and unwilling to disrupt the iPhone business in any meaningful way, which may lead to problems down the road.\nApple is an incredible business, but the failure of the Vision Pro is a prime example of the company's ongoing struggle to define a post-iPhone era. With a lofty valuation as well, Apple stock doesn't look great to me as a long-term investment.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?

Reuters reports, “The plan by the world's largest backer of Google's Android mobile platform is set to give a major boost to its developer Google, which is locked in a race with OpenAI and others to attract more consumer users to their AI model.” It is also a direct shot at Apple and the huge Chinese smartphone companies that sell most of their products in their home market. China is by far the largest smartphone market. Its smartphone count may be as high as a billion units.\n\nSamsung’s new Galaxy AI is only a part of its effort to take share from Apple. The other primary piece is its foldable phones, which have not yet gained popularity in the United States.\nAI use on smartphones is in its early days. So, Samsung cannot say for certain how much in unit sales it will take from Apple. However, this may be its best chance in the short term.\nApple’s stock price continues to rely primarily on the strength of iPhone sales. If Samsung’s effort succeeds, that share support weakens.\nApple Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Tesla shares rise after Trump praises Musk but Optimus robot challenges remain\n\nLouis Juricic\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 5:23 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nInvesting.com -- Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were in focus Monday as investors digested weekend developments including President Donald Trump’s comments about CEO Elon Musk and updates on the company’s ambitious Optimus robot project. Shares rose 1.8% in premarket.\nTrump praised Musk during comments to reporters aboard Air Force One, calling him \"great\" and \"well-meaning,\" while describing the Tesla CEO as \"80% supergenius and 20% he makes mistakes.\" Musk reciprocated on X, noting he \"had a lovely dinner last night with @POTUS and @FLOTUS\" and declaring \"2026 is going to be amazing!\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal published a detailed report on Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot project, which Musk has positioned as potentially \"the biggest product of all time\" with the ability to generate \"infinite\" revenue for the company. Musk’s new compensation package gives him 10 years to transform Tesla into an $8.5 trillion company and sell at least one million robots, which could earn him a $1 trillion pay package.\nDespite the ambitious vision, the Optimus project faces significant technical challenges. The robots are currently hand-made, with engineers struggling to create hands with both the sensitivity and dexterity of humans. In public demonstrations, the robots are often remotely operated by human engineers wearing body suits and virtual-reality headsets.\n\nSome Tesla employees have questioned the usefulness of the humanoid robots for routine manufacturing operations, suggesting purpose-built robots might be more effective for specific factory tasks. Robotics experts note that giving robots enough dexterity and environmental awareness to perform useful tasks remains a frontier challenge.\nTesla has already backed away from its initial timeline of deploying commercial versions of Optimus in its factories by the end of this year. The company is currently working on the third generation of the robot.\nThis robot initiative comes as Tesla’s core automotive business faces headwinds. The company reported vehicle sales fell 16% in the fourth quarter and dropped 9% for all of 2025, causing Tesla to lose its global EV sales crown to China’s BYD. Tesla’s stock, which tumbled in early 2025 amid slumping EV sales, had rebounded in recent months on optimism about Musk’s pivot to robotaxis and humanoid robots.\nRelated articles\nTesla shares rise after Trump praises Musk but Optimus robot challenges remain\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nGold: $4K Breakout Faces First Real Test as Stocks and Sentiment Rise Together\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla China Shipments Fall in 2025 Despite December Uptick\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 5:12 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nBYDDF\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nRecent data from China suggest Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) is navigating a more challenging operating backdrop in one of its most important markets. Preliminary figures from the China Passenger Car Association indicate the company shipped 851,732 vehicles from its Shanghai factory in 2025, representing about a 7% decline from the prior year, despite a pickup toward year-end. December shipments reached 97,171 vehicles, marking only the fourth month in 2025 to show year-on-year growth, with the majority of output believed to be absorbed by the domestic market, although export details were not specified.\n\nIs TSLA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe softer China performance appears to reflect broader pressures on Tesla's global business. The company has reported a second consecutive annual decline in overall deliveries and lost its position as the world's largest electric-vehicle maker to BYD ( BYDDF ). While third-quarter deliveries benefited from US customers accelerating purchases ahead of changes to subsidy policies, demand momentum has remained uneven as government support is gradually reduced across several regions. At the same time, reports note that consumer sentiment could still be weighing on demand, even after Elon Musk stepped back from a more visible role in politics.\nCompetitive dynamics in China continue to intensify, particularly as domestic players introduce increasingly technology-focused models. Xiaomi's YU7 sport utility vehicle has emerged as a close competitor to Tesla's Model Y, with November sales of 33,591 units compared with 33,935 units for Tesla's model, according to industry data. Despite these pressures on individual manufacturers, China's broader new-energy vehicle market continued to expand, with December NEV wholesales rising 4% year on year to 1.57 million units and full-year NEV sales increasing by about 25%, based on Bloomberg calculations using association data.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "ANET\n\nASML\n\nCOIN\n\nIBM\n\nQuick Read Wall Street will be back at full speed as traders and investors return from the Christmas and New Year holidays.\nMany on Wall Street are expecting an increase in volatility after a third straight year of double-digit gains for the S&P 500.\nWhile the AI and Data Center trade will remain in focus in 2026, expect the outsized gains of the last few years to taper off somewhat over the next 12 months.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nPre-Market Stock Futures: Futures are mainly trading higher as we start the first full week of trading in 2026. Investors and traders who were missing in action due to the Christmas and New Year's holiday are returning to a stock market that, for the third consecutive year, did not experience a \"Santa Claus rally,\" which refers to stocks trading higher the final five trading sessions of each year and the first two of the following year. With Santa Claus safely back at the North Pole, and Wall Street back to full speed this week, many top analysts are expecting heightened volatility this year after the third consecutive year of double-digit gains for the venerable S&P 500 which rose on the first trading day of 2026, closing last Friday at 6,858, up 0.19%, while the Nasdaq closed slightly lower at 23,235. The Dow Jones Industrials burst out of the gate, closing up 0.66% to finish the session at 48,382.\n\nTreasury Bonds: Sellers took the stage on Friday as yields across the Treasury curve finished the day higher. While some buyers were in the T-bill maturities, the longer-dated bonds ended the day lower. The 30-year bond closed at 4.87%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last quoted at 4.20%, down from 4.80% this time last year, and the first annual decline in yield in five years. Traders are waiting for a flood of economic data, and not expecting another rate cut until perhaps the summer, so yields could drift higher in the near term.\n\nOil and Gas: Prices were modestly lower across the energy complex on Friday, with Brent Crude down 0.16% at $60.75 and West Texas Intermediate closing the session at $57.32, down 0.17%. Oil prices hit five-year lows in 2025, and many expect WTI to trade in the $55- $60 range this year. The weekend capture of Venezuelan President Maduro and his wife may inject some volatility into the picture this week. His capture comes almost to the day, 36 years ago, since the U.S captured Panama's dictator, Manuel Noriega, for similar narco-terror and drug trafficking-related charges. Natural gas was the biggest loser on Friday, closing down 1.8% to $3.62. The sell-off comes as it was announced that U.S. LNG production broke a record, shipping 100 million tons in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nGold: Gold started the year the same way it ended 2025, closing modestly higher Friday at $4,330 after a stellar year that saw the precious metal soar 64%, while Silver, which ended Friday at $72.62, was up an astounding 147% last year, and Platinum saw a massive 125% gain in 2025. The Data Center buildouts and China's EV boom helped push other industrial commodities higher over the last year as well. Many expect Gold to reach $ 5,000 by the end of the year.\n\nCrypto: The crypto market rallied strongly on Friday, driven by gains across altcoins and memecoins. This represented a positive start to the year, after some very volatile sessions in December that saw big price swings across the major coins. At 8A EST, Bitcoin traded at $92,777, while Ethereum was quoted at $3,167.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.\nHere are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Monday, January 5, 2026.\n\nUpgrades: Arista Networks Inc.

      "Content": "At US$36.87, Is GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) Worth Looking At Closely?\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:52 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GFS\n\nGlobalFoundries Inc. ( NASDAQ:GFS ) saw a decent share price growth of 14% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine GlobalFoundries’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhat Is GlobalFoundries Worth? According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 23%, trading at US$36.87 compared to our intrinsic value of $29.86. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that GlobalFoundries’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for GlobalFoundries\nWhat does the future of GlobalFoundries look like? Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. GlobalFoundries' revenue growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. Unless expenses grow at the same level, or higher, this top-line growth should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? GFS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe GFS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GFS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for GFS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory Continues\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for GlobalFoundries from their most recent forecasts.

      "Content": "Will NVDA's Blackwell Platform Support Its Data Center Revenue Growth?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation ’s NVDA Blackwell platform is becoming a key driver of its Data Center revenue growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the Data Center segment generated $51.22 billion in revenues, representing 89.8% of total sales. This marked a staggering 66% year-over-year increase and 25% sequential growth.\n\nThe ongoing ramp-up of the Blackwell architecture is central to NVIDIA’s Data Center business growth. The GB300 systems, which offer higher performance and improved energy efficiency compared to the previous Hopper generation, are now shipping in large volumes.\nCustomers are using these systems to support complex artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, from large language models to real-time inference. NVIDIA’s full-stack approach, which combines graphics processing units (GPUs), networking and software, continues to make it the preferred partner for large-scale AI projects.\nThe near-term outlook still appears solid, with the company expecting further strength from Blackwell shipments and expanding orders across cloud, sovereign AI and enterprise AI projects. NVIDIA also sees the growing adoption of agentic AI, long-context workloads and advanced inference systems, all of which depend on high-performance GPU clusters, as key catalysts for long-term growth.\n\nThe growing demand for the company’s AI chips used in data centers is likely to continue aiding its Data Center business performance. Our model estimate for fiscal 2026 Data Center revenues is currently pegged at $190 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 65%.\nNVIDIA’s Competitors in the AI Data Center Space Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC are two major companies that are competing closely with NVIDIA in the AI data center space.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is gaining traction with its MI300 series accelerators, which are designed to handle training and inference for large AI models. AMD’s chips have attracted interest from major cloud providers seeking diversification beyond NVIDIA’s ecosystem. While Advanced Micro Devices’ software stack is still developing, its performance and pricing advantages make it a credible alternative.\n\nIntel is also reasserting its presence with the Gaudi series of AI accelerators. The company is positioning Gaudi3 as a cost-effective and scalable option for AI data centers, targeting enterprise clients looking for flexibility. Intel’s broad reach in CPUs and server infrastructure helps it integrate AI solutions more easily into existing systems.\nNVIDIA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 19.3% over the past six months compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s gain of 17.6%.\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA 6-Month Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, NVDA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26.8, lower than the industry’s average of 28.97.\nNVIDIA Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies a year-over-year increase of approximately 55.9% and 55.2%, respectively.

( NYSE:TSM ) shares advanced by the most since April, reaching a new record in Taipei as optimism around artificial intelligence demand carried into the start of the year. The world's largest contract chipmaker rose as much as 6.9% after Goldman Sachs lifted its price target by 35% to NT$2,330, reflecting expectations for another year of solid growth. The move underscored TSMC's importance as a key supplier to Nvidia and Apple, while helping lift Taiwan's Taiex more than 3% to a record above 30,000, a level officials said recently had appeared difficult to envision.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with PEP.\nIs TSM fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nStrength in TSMC fed into a broader rally across Asian semiconductor stocks as investors continued to add exposure to the AI theme, even as some concerns about overheating and short-term volatility lingered following recent US strikes against Venezuela. Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) extended gains for a fifth consecutive session ahead of preliminary results expected later in the week, which are likely to offer fresh insight into whether earnings can support recent share-price momentum. In Japan, Tokyo Electron and Advantest each climbed more than 7%, while Chinese chip stocks moved higher after the country's integrated circuit investment fund increased its stake in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and as attention grew around more efficient AI training approaches highlighted by DeepSeek.\n\nInvestor confidence in TSMC's position within the AI supply chain has continued to build, with the shares up 44% in 2025 and the company's market value rising above $1 trillion for the first time. Goldman analysts described AI as a multi-year growth engine for the company, pointing to improving profit margins even as projected capital spending could reach $150 billion over the next three years to expand capacity. Other analysts have suggested this year remains heavily centered on AI, while encouraging investors to focus on quality amid bubble concerns, with near-term attention also on TSMC's Jan. 15 earnings report and a wave of planned Hong Kong listings by AI-related companies that could raise as much as $4.1 billion.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Bull, Base and Bear Price Prediction and Forecast\n\nJoel South\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:15 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nQuick Read Tesla remains the leader of the EV revolution, dominating global market share despite the stock’s recent struggles.\nThe company faces numerous headwinds, which could ultimately impact its long-term performance.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Tesla Inc. ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) lost 9.68% over the past five trading sessions after losing 2.59% the five prior. A rally that began in early summer 2025 has pushed the stock into the green on the year, but the AI-induced sell-off that began in late October 2025 and carried through the end of the year has tempered Tesla's performance. Over the past year, the stock is up 6.57%.\nWhen the company reported Q3 earnings on Oct. 22, 2025, it announced quarterly revenue of $28.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year (YoY). However, earnings of 50 cents per share missed analysts' estimates of 54 cents per share. Concerningly, quarterly net income fell 37% YoY to $1.37 billion.\nTesla's stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk's role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk's friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla's outlook remains clouded.\n\nIn any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let's check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it's a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term.\nTesla's Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along Tesla's latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla's most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we'll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully.\n\nStory Continues\nUndoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it's one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas' view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied \"AI ETF\" given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes.\n\nThough Tesla's AI efforts are exciting, it's important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it's to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla's been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories?\nThe most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there's also the rumored \"Model Q\" entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a \"wild card.\"\n\nBull Case for Tesla's Share Price Cybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla's robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk's vision of the robotaxi future could be a reality within Trump's term. Of course, a more realistic timeframe would put such a future more than 10 years out.\n\nHowever, if Tesla can floor it on full self-driving (FSD) efforts, perhaps such a future could be closer to the present. There's a great deal of uncertainty with FSD, given the technical and regulatory unknowns. Either way, I view Musk's friendship with Trump as a boon for a Cybertruck rollout under his administration.\nIf Cybertruck expands its presence and becomes a hit within years rather than decades, TSLA stock could prove a bargain, given all that there is to gain. The big question, though, is how Cybercab will hold its own as Waymo pushes ahead with its impressive offering. Given robotaxis, like generative AI, are unlikely to be a \"winner takes all\" market, I think there's no reason why both robotaxi offerings can't win big from prime-time adoption of self-driving.\n\nAnother big question to consider is whether consumers will be interested in buying up Cybercabs to have them rolling around on the streets as ride-hailers. I think the business could prove quite lucrative for buyers and Tesla's margins over the long haul. After all, it can sell the car and continue to build a ride-hailing network while profiting from use of a ride-hailing app of sorts.\nCathie Wood thinks autonomous ride-hailing could represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. If Tesla can get a nice slice, Wood sees TSLA stock at $2,600 per share by 2029. Personally, I think the bull case (for the year ahead) could see TSLA at around $550 per share — or 33.67% higher than where the stock is trading today. That target is shared by Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, one of my favorite analysts in tech.\n\nOptimus: Optimus was a nice addition to the robotaxis event as it amused attendees. But the big question is how much potential the robot has once it's ready to go on sale to the general public.\nUndoubtedly, Tesla isn't the only one getting into the robotics game. Many Mag Seven members also investing heavily in home robots. While more rivals in home robots could be a threat to Optimus, I view it as more of a confirmation that there is a place in the home for such profound innovations.\nAs for the home robotics market, I do see 2026 as a tad overly optimistic for a launch. However, if robot \"friends\" do arrive by 2030, I think Tesla's growth rate could reaccelerate back to or even above 25% to 30% for some amount of time.\n\nAnalysts' Price Targets: So far this fall and during summer, the EV firm underwent a series of price target revisions from analysts. Stifel raised its price target on Tesla to $483 from $440 keeping its \"Buy\" rating while citing progress in its Robotaxi network. Canaccord raised its price target on Tesla to $490 from $333 keeping its \"Buy\" rating. In September, Mizuho raised its price target on Tesla to $450 from $375 while keeping an \"Outperform\" rating. In July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285 while maintaining a \"Neutral\" rating. Benchmark raised its price target on TSLA to $475 from $350 while maintaining a \"Buy\" rating following the successful launch of Tesla's robotaxi business in Austin. UBS raised its price target on TSLA to $215 from $190 but maintained its \"Sell\" rating.\n\nBear Case for Tesla's Share Price Falling Deliverables: Tesla reported 418,227 deliveries in Q4 2025 and 1,636,129 for 2025. Year over year, those figures are down 16% and 9%, respectively. Tesla was affected by the expiration of the U.S. electric vehicle tax credit in 2025 as well as increased competition in Europe. Morningstar forecasts that deliveries will continue to decrease through the first three quarters of 2026.\n\nCybertruck: Undoubtedly, there's still a lot of work to do before Cybertruck makes an impact on the car market. FSD capabilities need to step things up and the vehicle needs to be made in a way that won't break the bank. These are big asks. Some bears have doubts about whether the firm can execute the opportunity. In late March, the company announced that it was recalling nearly every Cybertruck due to a potential crash risk. This was an enormous blow to Musk's ambitions for the EV, which has already been subjected to harsh criticism about its perceived shortcomings among owners.\nBad Press: Musk's deteriorated image at the hands of his federal government involvement with DOGE aside, Tesla has continued to bear the brunt of bad news. It has been widely reported that the EV maker was the most dangerous vehicle brand, with the number of deaths among all automakers, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. According to the study, Tesla has a fatal accident rate of 5.6 per billion vehicle miles, compared to the overall average of just 2.8. Additionally, ongoing protests against the brand — including vandalism and arson — have occurred around the globe, from Italy and France to numerous states in the U.S.\n\nOptimus: Even if home robots are on the horizon, good luck asking consumers to spend thousands on a proven technology. Indeed, if Vision Pro taught us anything, it's that being an early adopter is expensive and probably not the best use of funds. Either way, I'd much rather wait and see how the robot ambitions pan out before getting too excited at this stage.\nInsider & Institutional Activity: There's an old adage on Wall Street that suggests investors should \"follow the money.\" Over the past 12 months, institutional ownership has decreased to 47.64%. In total, 116 institutional investors have entirely liquidated their Tesla positions over the past year.\nIncreased competition: In April 2025, a Jeff Bezos-backed EV company called Slate unveiled affordable EV truck and SUV models, which the company aims to sell at a cost of around $30,000. The company has billed itself as the \"anti-Tesla,\" and is made in the U.S. As Tesla's market share has fallen under 50% in EV-friendly California, the arrival of Slate could continue to erode sales.\n\nBase Case for Tesla's Share Price The base case for Tesla lies somewhere in between the two extremes. Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $395.89, or 9.62% potential downside from today's price. Meanwhile, the high-end target is $600 and the low-end target is $19.05. I'm inclined to view the $300 level as a fair-value level for the stock.\n\nMuch of Tesla's story depends on its big growth drivers. In the meantime, EV sales and the rise of more affordable models (Model Q) could be nearer-term stories to look forward to as one waits for the biggest of drivers to pay off. At the time of writing, TSLA stock goes for 210.31 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and an 15.20 price-to-sales (P/S). That makes the name slightly undervalued, at least in my view.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Analyst Report: Alphabet Inc\n\nJoseph Bonner, CFA\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:12 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAlphabet, formerly called Google, maintains the largest online index of websites accessible through automated search technology. It generates revenue through online advertising, cloud services, and hardware. Google is now an operating segment of Alphabet. The company was founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page and went public in 2004. Google's AdWords is an auction-based program that lets businesses display ads along with particular search results. Google's AdSense program enables websites in the company's network to serve targeted ads, based on search terms or web content, from AdWords advertisers. Most of the revenue generated through AdSense is shared with network partners. In addition, Alphabet owns YouTube.com, the web-based video site. It has expanded into mobile telephony with its Android smartphone operating system, into cloud services, and most recently, into autonomous driving. About 52% of Alphabet's revenue is generated outside the U.S. On April 3, 2014, Alphabet's new nonvoting class C shares began trading under the ticker GOOG. Alphabet's publicly held class A shares switched to the ticker GOOGL. The effect of the new class C share issuance was a non-economic 2-for-1 stock split. On July 15, 2022, Alphabet executed a 20-for-1 stock split on its Class A, Class B and Class C stock. The stock split had no impact on the economic value of GOOGL shares.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "GOOGL, AMZN, and DASH: J.P. Morgan Picks the Top Internet Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nTipRanks\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 4:09 AM PST 10 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nDASH\n\nGOOG\n\nThe AI revolution set the tone in 2025 for digital companies and internet stocks alike. What started as experimentation quickly turned into execution, as platforms rolled out AI across ads, search, content, and customer engagement. The impact was immediate, with productivity jumping, costs coming down, and new monetization paths opening up.\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nThat momentum, according to Doug Anmuth, is far from played out. The J.P. Morgan analyst, who’s ranked among the top 2% on Wall Street, believes the internet sector has high potential for investors looking to run with the bulls this year.\n\n“Heading into 2026, we remain constructive on overall digital trends & Internet secular leaders, with AI once again the primary focus across the group. We anticipate our coverage universe will deliver another solid year of revenue growth in 2026, with mega-caps in the low-mid teens Y/Y growth range, with upside potential. However, Operating Income, GAAP EPS, & FCF will be more mixed in 2026, as companies balance revenue growth with key investments, particularly to capitalize on GenAI-related spending,” Anmuth opined.\nFollowing from this, Anmuth has been pointing out his ‘top pick’ internet stocks to buy for 2026, specifically citing Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) , and DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) . TipRanks data show that all three carry Strong Buy ratings on Wall Street, so let’s take a closer look and see what’s driving the enthusiasm across the board.\n\nAlphabet\nThe first JPM pick on the list is Alphabet, a name investors hardly need introduced. The company’s ecosystem spans everything from Search and YouTube to autonomous driving and logistics bets, but the economic engine remains unchanged: Google’s grip on search-driven digital advertising. That core franchise continues to fund both steady growth and Alphabet’s longer-dated AI ambitions.\nIn 3Q25, Google ads generated $74.2 billion of Alphabet’s $102.3 billion in total revenue. At the same time, Google Cloud is becoming a more meaningful contributor, posting $15.16 billion in revenue and growing 33.5% year-over-year, supported by enterprise AI workloads and infrastructure demand.\n\nStory Continues\nThe third quarter marked an important milestone for Alphabet, with the company’s first-ever $100-billion-plus quarter. These strong gains in revenue and earnings have come as the company is making a concerted push to enhance and promote its AI-powered services. The company has rolled out AI improvements to Google Search, in the form of the AI Overviews and the interactive AI Mode. In addition, the company has been integrating its Gemini across multiple products and platforms, making it available as an AI assistant on the Android OS. In addition, last month, Google announced the global launch of Gemini 3 Flash, the latest – and fastest – of its AI models.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the market has taken notice. GOOGL shares surged 65% in 2025, and if analyst Doug Anmuth is right, investors may not be done celebrating just yet.\n“Even after very strong performance… GOOG/L is our top pick into 2026 as we expect AI leadership, full stack strength, data advantages, and global distribution to drive growth acceleration and margin stability. We believe Google can sustain low-mid-teens% Search revenue growth off a large base. AI Search should prove expansionary, driving greater query volumes, improved click quality, and higher prices, offsetting fewer clicks per query. Gemini is once again leading the AI leaderboards, w/Gemini 3.0 faster to deploy across Google and infused within virtually all products. The Gemini App is gaining share with 650M+ MAUs, and we believe robust AI-driven demand will drive acceleration in Cloud growth into the 40’s%+ range,” Anmuth noted.\n\nPutting numbers behind his conviction, Anmuth rates Alphabet shares Overweight (i.e. Buy). His $385 price target implies 22% upside from current levels. (To watch Anmuth’s track record, click here )\nOverall, Wall Street remains broadly constructive on GOOGL, with the stock carrying a Strong Buy consensus rating. Of the 34 analysts covering the name, 27 recommend buying, while 7 sit on the sidelines. However, the Street’s average target of $327.42 suggests just ~4% upside over the next 12 months. Still, as Alphabet has shown time and again, periods of limited upside often give way to upward target revisions as execution and results continue to come through. (See GOOGL stock forecast )\nAmazon\nThe next name on JPM’s list is Amazon – a familiar heavyweight, but one that still rewards a closer look. The scale is firmly in place, with nearly $690 billion in trailing-year revenue, a fortress balance sheet with nearly $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash exiting 3Q25, and a logistics footprint that few global enterprises can realistically replicate. The company is best known, of course, for being the world’s ‘one stop-shop’ online, and for backing that with an unparalleled network of warehouse and delivery assets.\nAI is coming to the fore for Amazon in more concrete ways. In October of last year, Amazon announced that its Project Ranier, in Indiana, is now in use – and is one of the largest AI compute clusters in the world. The project, an $11 billion data center build, features nearly half a million Trainium2 chips, and was deployed less than one year after its plans were first announced. Anthropic, which partners with Amazon on AI ventures, is already running workloads at Project Rainer. The project is an undertaking of AWS, which created the custom-designed Trainium2 chips.\n\nEarly in November, AWS announced a multi-year strategic partnership that empowers OpenAI. The agreement, worth $38 billion over seven years, gives OpenAI access to AWS’s top-notch platform and infrastructure to run world-class AI workloads.\nAll of this underscores both the growth of AWS and its increasing interconnection with Amazon’s AI undertakings. This is also clear from the company’s financial results. In the 3Q25 report, the last released, it showed that AWS revenue came to $33 billion, for 20% year-over-year growth. AWS made up over 18% of Amazon’s total revenue. That total revenue came to $180.2 billion in the third quarter, and was up more than 13% year-over-year while beating the forecast by $2.4 billion. Amazon reported a net income of $21.2 billion, and an EPS of $1.95.\n\nAnmuth, covering Amazon’s stock for JPMorgan, is looking at an upbeat future based on strong gains in the AI businesses. He states, “We remain bullish into 2026 supported by AWS growth acceleration, solid Stores growth & continued share gains, N.America & Int’l OI margin expansion, and solid AWS margins, all of which we believe support FCF doubling to $59B even against AI-driven capex growth. Strong secular growth, workload/tech migrations, & AI contribution/partnerships (including Project Rainier & OpenAI) drive AWS growth acceleration. We project 2026 AWS growth of +23%, vs. +19% in 2025, which could prove conservative… We view valuation as attractive, w/shares trading at ~24x 2027E GAAP EPS & ~31x 2027E FCF.”\nAnmuth rates as Overweight (i.e., Buy), a rating that he complements with a $305 price target that suggests a one-year upside potential of 35%.\nOverall, the 46 recent analyst reviews on AMZN have a lopsided split of 45 Buys to 1 Hold behind their Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently trading at $226.50, and their $295.62 average price target implies an upside of 30.5% by this time next year. (See AMZN stock forecast )\nDoorDash\nThe last of JPM’s ‘top picks’ on our radar is DoorDash, the Silicon Valley company that specializes in food ordering and delivery. DoorDash has been in business since 2013, and today is a $95 billion leader in its field. DoorDash operates across the US and in an additional 30 countries. It connects its customers to their favorite eateries and food suppliers through its online marketplace and commerce platforms.\n\nFor several years now, DoorDash has been working to expand by acquisition. During this past year, the company made two important deals, acquiring the restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion in cash and the British food delivery firm Deliveroo in a $3.9 billion transaction. DoorDash said this past November that it intends to keep up its big spending and outlined ‘several hundred million’ in planned expenses for projects ranging from improvements in global tech stacks to autonomous delivery units.\nDoorDash is already making strides in autonomous delivery. It released its first autonomous robot delivery vehicle, Dot, this past September. Dot is designed to tackle local delivery routes, using sidewalks, bike lanes, and driveways, and it is currently in use in Tempe, Arizona, and Mesa, Arizona, for an early access program. Tempe and Mesa are small cities, and DoorDash has plans to ramp up the robot to larger urban areas.\n\nOn the financial side, we can look at DoorDash’s 3Q25 report. The company listed $3.4 billion in revenue for the period, a figure that was up 27% year-over-year and came $89 million better than forecasts had predicted. DoorDash’s bottom line figure, listed as 55 cents earnings per share, was 13 cents per share below expectations – although it was also up significantly from the 38-cent figure reported in the prior-year quarter. We should note that DoorDash had on hand, at the end of Q3, $7.4 billion in cash and other liquid assets – so its indication of intent to spend ‘several hundred million’ on various improvements and projects may be less worrisome than was first assumed.\nThe JPM take on DASH is laid out, again, by Doug Anmuth. The analyst, who is rated by TipRanks in the top 2% of Wall Street’s analysts, writes of DoorDash’s likely prospects: “We highlight that DASH’s strong performance in the core business over the last several years has been driven by platform investments, and we expect the current wave to also generate substantial ROI over the next few years. While payback on these investments could vary we think concerns around re-platforming execution risk are likely overstated. We also think consensus has layered in the costs from these investments for ‘26 and beyond, however, it likely under-estimating the associated returns. We also expect DASH to invest in Deliveroo and gain share in key markets like the UK & France as the company looks to drive stronger top-line growth and optimize the business for L-T profit dollars.”\n\nSetting out the bottom line, Anmuth adds, “Amidst these incremental investments, we think DASH will continue to see strong trends in the core business, with a focus on selection, quality, affordability and service levels driving better retention as well as order frequency.”\nIn his final assessment, Anmuth puts an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on DASH stock, with a $300 price target that indicates room for a 36% upside on the one-year time frame.\nAll in all, DASH shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating that is backed by 28 analysts’ reviews, including 23 Buys and 5 Holds. With a share price of $219.79 and an average target price of $281.12, DASH has a ~28% upside potential for the coming year.

(See AMZN stock forecast )\nDoorDash\nThe last of JPM’s ‘top picks’ on our radar is DoorDash, the Silicon Valley company that specializes in food ordering and delivery. DoorDash has been in business since 2013, and today is a $95 billion leader in its field. DoorDash operates across the US and in an additional 30 countries. It connects its customers to their favorite eateries and food suppliers through its online marketplace and commerce platforms.\n\nFor several years now, DoorDash has been working to expand by acquisition. During this past year, the company made two important deals, acquiring the restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion in cash and the British food delivery firm Deliveroo in a $3.9 billion transaction. DoorDash said this past November that it intends to keep up its big spending and outlined ‘several hundred million’ in planned expenses for projects ranging from improvements in global tech stacks to autonomous delivery units.\nDoorDash is already making strides in autonomous delivery. It released its first autonomous robot delivery vehicle, Dot, this past September. Dot is designed to tackle local delivery routes, using sidewalks, bike lanes, and driveways, and it is currently in use in Tempe, Arizona, and Mesa, Arizona, for an early access program. Tempe and Mesa are small cities, and DoorDash has plans to ramp up the robot to larger urban areas.\n\nOn the financial side, we can look at DoorDash’s 3Q25 report. The company listed $3.4 billion in revenue for the period, a figure that was up 27% year-over-year and came $89 million better than forecasts had predicted. DoorDash’s bottom line figure, listed as 55 cents earnings per share, was 13 cents per share below expectations – although it was also up significantly from the 38-cent figure reported in the prior-year quarter. We should note that DoorDash had on hand, at the end of Q3, $7.4 billion in cash and other liquid assets – so its indication of intent to spend ‘several hundred million’ on various improvements and projects may be less worrisome than was first assumed.\nThe JPM take on DASH is laid out, again, by Doug Anmuth. The analyst, who is rated by TipRanks in the top 2% of Wall Street’s analysts, writes of DoorDash’s likely prospects: “We highlight that DASH’s strong performance in the core business over the last several years has been driven by platform investments, and we expect the current wave to also generate substantial ROI over the next few years. While payback on these investments could vary we think concerns around re-platforming execution risk are likely overstated. We also think consensus has layered in the costs from these investments for ‘26 and beyond, however, it likely under-estimating the associated returns. We also expect DASH to invest in Deliveroo and gain share in key markets like the UK & France as the company looks to drive stronger top-line growth and optimize the business for L-T profit dollars.”\n\nSetting out the bottom line, Anmuth adds, “Amidst these incremental investments, we think DASH will continue to see strong trends in the core business, with a focus on selection, quality, affordability and service levels driving better retention as well as order frequency.”\nIn his final assessment, Anmuth puts an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on DASH stock, with a $300 price target that indicates room for a 36% upside on the one-year time frame.\nAll in all, DASH shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating that is backed by 28 analysts’ reviews, including 23 Buys and 5 Holds. With a share price of $219.79 and an average target price of $281.12, DASH has a ~28% upside potential for the coming year.

(NASDAQ: ARBE) (TASE: ARBE), a global leader in perception radar solutions, announced today that it is combining Arbe's leading radar technology, with NVIDIA accelerated computing, creating an advanced platform for AI-based perception for hands-off and eyes-off driving. For the first time, at CES 2026 Arbe will showcase its automotive-grade radar system and demonstrate its readiness for integration with complete perception stacks.\n\nThe automotive-grade radar delivers unprecedented detection density, a raw point cloud of over 20,000 detections per frame, generated by a channel array of 2,304 channels, providing a rich foundation that enables systems to run advanced perception and AI algorithms. The combination of Arbe's affordable, high-performance radar solution and NVIDIA's powerful computing is democratizing autonomous technology, making advanced perception accessible, reliable and cost-effective.\n\n\"This initiative allows us to create a new benchmark for perception in all conditions. The collaboration accelerates the adoption of safer, more reliable, and more affordable autonomous driving solutions for automakers worldwide,\" says Kobi Marenko, co-founder and CEO of Arbe. \"At CES, we are demonstrating our ultra-HD radar in action and how it navigates complicated highway scenarios at true highway speeds.\"\nTo enable eyes-off capabilities at highway speeds, accurate long-range detection and object separation are imperative. When a car travels at a speed of up to 130 km/h (approximately 80 mph), it needs to safely detect vehicles and obstacles at a 300 meter distance to give the system enough time to brake gradually, change lanes, or take other action without causing disruptions to surrounding traffic. Arbe's ultra-HD radar achieves over 300-meter point cloud range detections while delivering the resolution and dynamic range needed to interpret complex highway scenarios and introduce features for smooth, human-like driving.\n\nThe Arbe HD radar solution offers consistent, reliable performance across all environmental conditions, including snow, sleet, rain, fog, and low-visibility scenarios. By providing robust perception in situations where other sensor modalities may be challenged, Arbe's perception radar maintains dependable operation at all times. Arbe's perception radar, when combined with accelerated computing by NVIDIA, delivers consistent performance, enabling eyes-off driving at highway speeds with the human-like flow and predictability required for real safety and consumer trust.\n\nStory Continues\nLive Demonstrations at CES 2026, Booth 4551, West Hall, LVCC\nArbe will present live demonstrations of its automotive-grade radar technology, including:\nAI-based Occupancy Grid: In collaboration with Perciv AI, Arbe will showcase an AI-based Occupancy Grid that delivers a highly detailed map of the space surrounding the vehicle, illustrating occupied areas and relevant use cases for advanced perception.\nLiDAR-like Performance with HD radar: Arbe will demonstrate how its high-definition radar can achieve performance comparable to LiDAR, enabling lower overall sensor suite costs while improving system redundancy.\nIntegration with NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin: Arbe's high-resolution radar data will be processed on the NVIDIA in-vehicle computing platform.\n\nTo schedule a demo of Arbe's advanced radar technology, visit https://arberobotics.com/ces2026/ .\nAbout Arbe\nArbe (Nasdaq: ARBE), a global leader in ultra-high-resolution radar solutions, is driving a radar revolution. Its cutting-edge radar chipset delivers up to 100 times more detail than other radar systems on the market, empowering automakers and radar Tier-1s to develop safe driving systems that scale from ADAS to hands-free, eyes-off capabilities and up to full vehicle autonomy. Arbe's technology addresses the most critical use cases by delivering real-time, 4-dimensional imaging that enables the perception stack with information such as precise mapping of drivable free space in highway and urban environments across all weather and lighting conditions. With its transformative impact across passenger, commercial, and industrial vehicle segments, as well as other advanced safety applications, Arbe is redefining the role of radar in next-generation mobility.\n\nHeadquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel, the company also operates offices in the United States, Germany, and China.

      "Content": "The Next Phase of the AI Boom Could Be Even Bigger for Nvidia\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 3:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia is shifting production capacity to maximize its data center products.\nNvidia is resuming sales to China.\nRubin architecture will drive a massive spending spree among its clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an absolutely incredible performer over the past three years. Its stock outperformed the market in 2023, 2024, and 2025, but can it do it in 2026? I think this next phase of artificial intelligence could be even bigger for Nvidia.\nHow is that possible? Let's find out.\nNvidia has sold out its capacity When reviewing Nvidia's Q3 results, CEO Jensen Huang noted that Nvidia was \"sold out\" of cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) . That's simply incredible, especially considering that Nvidia generated $57 billion in total revenue. Data center GPUs made up the majority of that total, with $51.2 billion in sales coming from that division.\n\nThe data center division also encompasses other non-GPU products Nvidia makes to support its ecosystem. However, it's still impressive to sell out of a product when sales are already that high. To meet the unprecedented demand, Nvidia is looking to expand production capacity in any way possible. While it's pushing its suppliers upstream to provide more chips and other hardware, it's also making capacity changes on other product lines.\nOne area where Nvidia is making some hard choices is that it's reportedly cutting production capacity for its gaming chips. Gaming generated $4.3 billion in revenue during Q3 for Nvidia, so it's not insignificant to Nvidia's business, but it could free up some chip capacity to build more profitable and in-demand data center GPUs.\n\nCombined with the increased supply chain, these two factors will increase Nvidia's production capacity to meet customer demand. However, meeting all of their demand may not be possible due to the sheer volume required by its clients.\nSo, next time you hear about an AI hyperscaler launching its own chip or signing a deal with a competitor, like Advaced Micro Devices , investors shouldn't assume that Nvidia's product is inferior. It could be that Nvidia doesn't have the capacity that they need, so they are turning to alternative sources.\nThis bodes well for Nvidia's future and will allow it to control the margins and pricing on its products if supply constraints persist. However, two other factors could provide Nvidia with a significant growth boost in 2026.\n\nNvidia is returning to China and launching a new product In April 2025, Nvidia's export license to ship H20 chips (which were specifically created to abide by U.S. export laws to China) was revoked. This caused a huge dent in Nvidia's business, although the company kept growing rapidly. For Q2, Nvidia expected about $8 billion in revenue from H20 sales. That revenue could return shortly, but it has a catch.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia is allowed to sell the chips again, but at a 25% fee. It's unknown whether Nvidia will eat the fee or pass that on to the customer, but either way, Nvidia is gaining back a massive client that will boost its growth in 2026. It's also still unclear what restrictions Beijing will put on those sales.\n\nAnother factor for 2026 is the launch of Nvidia's next-generation architecture. The current Blackwell architecture provides impressive results, but its successor, Rubin, will be even more impressive. This upgrade will drive further costs associated with switching to 800-volt power.\nNvidia is poised to capitalize on the significant upgrades that its latest and greatest system will offer, further strengthening its growth case.\nAll of this adds up to Nvidia's vision for future data center construction. Nvidia believes that global data center capital expenditures will rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from around $600 billion in 2025. That's simply amazing growth, and if the industry actually does reach those spending levels, Nvidia's stock could skyrocket over the next few years as a result.\n\nWith all of the massive upgrades coming down the pipeline for Nvidia, a return to China, and increasing production capacity by decreasing output of other product lines, Nvidia is doing everything it can to maximize sales. I think this will bode well for Nvidia's stock, and 2026 could be its biggest year yet.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be Microsoft's Stock Price at the End of 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 3:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Microsoft is taking a neutral position in the AI buildout.\nCopilot still needs to prove its worth to its users.\nMicrosoft carries a premium valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) had a strong 2025, rising from about $420 per share at the start of 2025 to around $490 by December. That's about a 17% return, making it a strong stock pick in normal years. However, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) also had a great year, rising around 18%. This means that Microsoft's stock lost to the market despite an impressive year.\nLooking ahead to 2026, will Microsoft be able to outperform the market? Or will it be another year of market-matching to market-losing performance? Let's figure out what Microsoft's stock price could be to end 2026, and see if that will be good enough to beat the market.\nMicrosoft is a neutral player in the AI race There are several varieties of companies involved in the artificial intelligence realm. Microsoft is more of an AI facilitator rather than a developer, which could have its benefits and drawbacks as we move closer to an AI-first world.\nOne of Microsoft's major components that isn't discussed enough is its Azure cloud computing business. Azure is the second-largest cloud computing service behind Amazon Web Services (AWS), but it may not stay there for long with its rapid growth rate. In first-quarter fiscal year 2026 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), Azure's revenue rose 40% year over year, doubling AWS' 20% growth. Azure's performance likely has to do with the fact that it's neutral in what generative AI models it offers to users.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has a 27% OpenAI stake, that's not the only model it offers on Azure. Developers can deploy competing models like xAI's Grok or Anthropic's Claude, or choose a cost-efficient model from DeepSeek. Because Microsoft isn't tying its success to one model, it can benefit from the rising tide of increased AI usage.\nOne area where increased AI usage has benefited Microsoft is its Office products. Its Copilot add-on, which gives users generative AI capabilities specifically for these platforms, has become popular and helped deliver 17% Microsoft 365 commercial growth and 26% 365 consumer growth.\nAll these trends that existed in 2025 aren't likely to disappear in 2026, and Wall Street analyst projections back that assumption up. For FY 2026 (ending June 30, 2026), expect Microsoft to deliver 16% sales growth. For FY 2027 (ending June 30, 2027), the consensus estimate for Microsoft's revenue growth is 15%. That's pretty much on par with where Microsoft has been over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\nMicrosoft is a very successful business, but it's also quite predictable. This should give us a great basis on which to build out our stock price estimate.\nMicrosoft won't get any help from an increased valuation One area investors must consider to predict a stock price is how the company will be valued. Thirty times forward earnings (or greater) has become the norm for big tech companies like Microsoft and its peers, and assigning a year-end valuation of 30 times forward earnings is reasonable and fair.\nIf Microsoft can deliver a 15% growth rate from a revenue and earnings perspective throughout the back half of FY 2026 and the first half of FY 2027, and maintain its 30 times forward earnings valuation, that would indicate the stock will rise by the corresponding growth rate.\nSo, with Microsoft's stock trading at about $485 per share right now, my year-end stock price expectation for Microsoft would be nearly $560. As mentioned above, that growth rate wasn't enough to beat the market in 2025. However, over the long term, if Microsoft can continue growing at a double-digit growth rate, I have no doubt that it will maintain its status as a long-term winner, making it a solid stock to buy now and hold for several years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "加入《Money錢》雜誌官方line＠財經資訊不漏接\n\n台股加權指數今（2025）年下半年以來，經歷數月的上漲行情後，在11月回檔修正，若回測季線（至11/19截稿日約26,330點）能守住，整理期可望縮短；若跌破季線，預期在25,000點以下有強勁支撐，震盪整理期將拉長。即便大盤跌破季線，仍是分批低接台積電（2330）等AI股的好時機，2026年第1季可望挑戰30,000點。\n\n今年9月上旬，台股加權指數首度站上25,000點，台積電為首的AI族群價量齊揚，利多消息頻傳，原先保守觀望的散戶在樂觀氣氛下持續加碼，融資增加幅度明顯，外資則在高檔邊拉抬股價邊出貨（10月至11月19日累計賣超3,091億元），這是近期台股大回檔的背景因素。\n\n近年台股跟美股同樣由AI族群領漲，由於漲勢集中在少數幾家龍頭指標股，且漲幅都很大，加上輝達（Nvidia）斥資1千億美元入股AI新創公司OpenAI（營運尚處於虧損，但估值很高）換取後者擴大採購自家GPU、AI伺服器，近期投資人對於AI泡沫化的疑慮升高。\n\n不過，AI是決定國力與企業生產力的技術革命，尤其美國、中國都投入巨資打造AI基礎建設，絕不允許自己在這場科技競賽中落居下風，其它有條件的國家也想要打造本國專屬的AI資料中心（主權AI），並藉此帶動產業轉型升級。\n\n目前全球仍處於擴大AI基礎建設投資的階段，投資人還不需要擔心AI算力過剩，倒是要留意若電力供應跟不上，AI的發展會短暫受阻。\n\nAI科技巨頭微軟（Mircosoft）執行長納德拉（Satya Nadella）11月初與OpenAI執行長奧特曼（Sam Altman）隔空接受《Bg2 Pod》節目專訪談到，目前AI產業面臨的問題並非算力供過於求，而是缺乏足夠電力。納德拉甚至說，因電力供應不足，微軟目前有一部分AI GPU閒置在倉庫中。\n\n這也意謂電力公司，或者提供電力系統設備與建置管理服務的廠商，有機會在AI基礎建設投資狂潮中受惠，例如：華城（1519）、東元（1504）、高力（8996）、盈正（3628）、康舒（6282）等。不過，這些公司股價大都已飆漲，本益比也偏高，投資人須審慎評估買點。\n\n投資人觀察的重點不在於這些科技巨頭說了什麼，而是「做了什麼」。從亞馬遜（Amazon）、Google、Meta等美國AI科技巨頭持續擴大資本支出的態勢看來，AI投資泡沫在未來1～2年會持續膨脹，已上車且成本低的投資人不必急著下車，新進投資人宜趁股價回檔建立基本持股，但切勿使用融資等財務槓桿，以免在市場震盪加劇時受傷。\n\n台股AI族群當中，投資人較熟悉的是台積電、創意（3443）、日月光投控（3711）、台達電（2308）、光寶科（2301）、智邦（2345）、信驊（5274）、台光電（2383）、台燿（6274）、金像電（2368）、欣興（3037）、奇鋐（3017）、雙鴻（3324）、健策（3653）、鴻海（2317）、緯創（3231）、緯穎（6669）等。這些個股在回檔整理過後，有些會再創新高，其中台積電是穩健投資人的首選，建議1,400元以下找買點。\n\n台股AI族群當中，目前最值得的關注的是高階晶片的分選與測試設備大廠鴻勁（7769）。該公司產品包含測試分類機（Handler）、主動式溫控系統（ATC）、水冷板（Cold Plate）與客製化治具等整套方案，可因應AI高效能運算（HPC）、車用與通訊晶片高功耗、高頻測試需求，受輝達、亞馬遜等美系終端大客戶青睞。因其設備主要出貨給終端客戶指定的亞洲地區半導體封測廠，輸美關稅的影響很小。\n\n鴻勁甫於今年11月27日以1,495元承銷價從興櫃轉上市掛牌。截至2025年11月18日，鴻勁市值高達3,854億元，法人看好其強勁成長動能將延續到明後年。某外資券商在最新出爐的研究報告中，依其現增後股本18.1億元（原股本為16.1億元）預估，2025、2026、2027年稅後EPS分別為75.2、96、115.7元，並將目標價從2,500元調升至3,500元。\n\n鴻勁去年登錄興櫃，股價最低在今年4月跌到570元（川普宣布開徵「對等關稅」引發全球股市重挫），最高於11月初漲到2,625元，近期一度跌到2,200元，IPO前競拍結束後股價又開始上漲。這次新股競拍數量為13,198張，得標加權均價為2,030.37元，最低、最高得標平均價分別為1,930、2,285元，都遠高於底價1,196元，可見非常搶手。\n\n鴻勁轉上市掛牌後，隨著流動性提升，會吸引更多外資、投信（興櫃交易期間不能買）買盤，進一步推高市值，明年第1季正式納入元大台灣50（0050）成分股後，將成為台股市值型被動ETF、主動科技ETF的基本持股，長多行情值得期待。\n\n除了鴻勁，主攻印刷電路板（PCB）及半導體設備的大量（3167）也是值得高度關注的成長股。受惠於AI高階封裝需求，大量的高階CCD背鑽機（高精密PCB鑽孔機）銷售量大增，今年產能滿載，目前在手訂單交期已排到2026年，可望帶動明年營運進一步走高。\n\n大量除了深耕高階PCB設備，也成功跨入半導體領域，後者占上半年營收比重近1成，其中包括量測（前段製程鎖定化學機械研磨的研磨墊量測、晶圓級量測）、自動光學檢測（AOI）及自動化設備，已出貨給國內晶圓代工和封測大廠，在SoIC、InFO與CoWoS等先進封裝皆有對應的產品。\n\n因應客戶大單需求，大量今年擴增產能50%，第3季已陸續投產。受惠PCB高階機型與半導體設備出貨量成長，大量今年前10個月累計合併營收40.28億元，年增108.47%，全年營收估較去年成長80%～90%，2026年營運將更上一層樓。\n\n電子上游的DRAM、Nand Flash族群，下半年漲勢十分凌厲，指標股分別是南亞科（2408）、華邦（2344）、群聯（8299），其中僅群聯推出直接受惠AI需求的新產品，是相對穩健的投資標的。\n\n聯準會（Fed）先前連續2個月降息，今年12月可能暫停降息，但現任主席鮑爾（Jerome Powell）明年5月將卸任，川普準備提名對降息配合度較高的接任人選，市場預期明年下半年Fed將加速降息，聯邦基金利率可能降至3%，這有利於明年上半年（尤其是第1季）AI科技股的表現，也有利於備受壓抑的營建、資產股表現（2026年縣市長大選前政策做多有加分作用）。\n\n（圖片來源：Shutterstock僅示意 / 內容僅供參考，投資請謹慎為上）\n\n文章出處：《Money錢》2025年12月號\n\n下載「錢雜誌App」隨時隨地掌握財經脈動",

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AVGO.\nIs AVGO fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2026-01-05, Broadcom Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $207.48. It's currently trading at a price of $347.62. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -67.54%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run.

GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 19.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years.

Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $173.22.

You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount.

It's currently trading at a price of $188.85. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -51.08%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$4\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 47.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n262.67\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n491.67\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n125.00\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $98.31. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -92.1%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

      "Content": "Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) Could Become A Multi-Bagger\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 2:40 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nIf you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Cirrus Logic's ( NASDAQ:CRUS ) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Cirrus Logic is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.20 = US$449m ÷ (US$2.4b - US$210m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025) .\nTherefore, Cirrus Logic has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 8.9%.\nView our latest analysis for Cirrus Logic\nIn the above chart we have measured Cirrus Logic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Cirrus Logic .\nSo How Is Cirrus Logic's ROCE Trending? We like the trends that we're seeing from Cirrus Logic. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 20%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 46%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Cirrus Logic thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nThe Key Takeaway To sum it up, Cirrus Logic has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Considering the stock has delivered 31% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.\nOne more thing, we've spotted 1 warning sign facing Cirrus Logic that you might find interesting.\n\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\nHave feedback on this article?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and TotalEnergies SE, as well as a micro-cap stock MIND Technology, Inc.The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\nAhead of Wall Street The daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company&rsquo;s international expansion and diversification across e-commerce, AWS cloud services, advertising, and streaming create multiple revenue streams while reducing concentration risk.\n\nManagement's Q4 2025 guidance projects net sales of $206-$213 billion with operating income between $21-$26 billion, reflecting operational efficiency gains. AI integration across operations enhances personalization, logistics and AWS offerings, strengthening competitive positioning. The Zacks analyst expect 2025 net sales to grow 10.6% from 2024.\nHowever, substantial capital expenditure requirements for AI infrastructure and data centers strain financial resources and compress margins. The company's expanding debt burden reduces financial flexibility amid rising interest rates. Intensifying competition from Walmart, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud is an overhang.\n\nStory Continues\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>> )\nShares of Palantir have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past six months (+32.3% vs. -6.5%). The company&rsquo;s AI strategy, driven by Foundry, Gotham, and AIP platforms, targets government and commercial sectors, enabling real-time insights and operational efficiency. Notable defense projects, like Open DAGIR and AIP boot camps for commercial clients, boost customer acquisition.\n\nWith $5.4 billion in cash, no debt, and S&P 500 inclusion, Palantir enjoys strong liquidity, growing revenues, and increased investor visibility. Meanwhile, PLTR's reluctance to pay dividends is a green flag for dividend-seeking investors.\nIntense competition from tech giants and rising costs amidst a rapidly evolving AI landscape and an elevated valuation challenge its appeal. Palantir shares have gained 122.5% in a year, and we have a neutral rating on it in anticipation of a correction.\n(You can read the full research report on Palantir here >>> )\nTotalEnergies&rsquo; shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past six months (+5.9% vs. +1.7%). The company is gaining from contributions coming from startups, acquired assets, well-spread LNG assets and upstream assets located in the new hydrocarbon-producing regions. Contributions from multi-energy assets spread across the globe boost its earnings.\n\nTotalEnergies&rsquo; free cash flow allows it to increase shareholders&rsquo; value. Cost reduction initiatives will boost margins and the company aims to generate 15-20% of sales from low-carbon business by 2040. TotalEnergies is investing in clean power generation and lowering emissions.\nYet TotalEnergies operates multiple assets globally, and in some regions, production might be impacted due to security concerns. It remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production.\n(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here >>> )\nShares of MIND Technology have gained +11.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Technology Services industry&rsquo;s gain of +15.4%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $79.44 million shows improving near-term visibility, with a $9.5 million seismic contract secured in December 2025, highlighting product demand. Recent expansion of its Huntsville facility supports higher-margin throughput and positions the firm for complex project growth.\n\nNew capital flexibility via a $25 million ATM offering and $4 million repurchase program enhances strategic agility. MIND benefits from exposure to a resilient global marine seismic market and operates a globally diversified footprint, aiding responsiveness and contract wins.\nHowever, declining revenue and backlog highlight demand volatility, and a growing reliance on aftermarket sales may limit long-term upside. Profitability is pressured by modestly rising operating expenses. Despite this, shares are up 13.7% in the past year, and valuation remains attractive at 1.1X EV/Sales and 7.87X EV/EBITDA, well below peers.\n(You can read the full research report on MIND Technology here >>> )\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

      "Content": "財經中心／王駿凱報導\n\n2025年被譽為全球金融市場的「雲霄飛車」之年。自4月起，由於對等關稅的影響，全球股市遭遇重挫，但隨著關稅逐步鬆綁，中美關係的改善，市場在年底之前一路攀升。\n\n儘管11月時AI相關疑慮再度浮現，年底出現賣壓使得收盤顯得起伏不定，但12月底市場仍強勢回升，國內股市及臺積電也收在年內最高點。在2025年的投資策略中，關鍵在於掌握川普的個性，只有理解其節奏，才能在市場因對等關稅修正而面臨的挑戰中，實現投資組合的豐收。街口臺灣基金經理人蘇昱霖指出，展望2026年，川普的言行仍將是市場的焦點。預期股市在漲勢後可能出現短期波動，但也可視為逢低買進的良機。另外，預計2026年聯準會主席改選後的新任人選將會配合川普推動降息政策，這將對市場形成利多影響。近期需留意日本及部分新興市場央行的鷹派姿態，但只要各國央行的政策不過度激進，全球資金流向依然將主要受到美國聯準會政策的指引。在產業發展方面，2026年AI依然是主流，尤其在美國解除H200禁令後，NVIDIA的發展前景看好。Google在去年底推出的Gemini服務以大幅折扣和2T記憶體促銷，吸引許多使用者轉向付費AI服務，使得AI雙引擎NVIDIA與Google的未來增長潛力持續受到看好。\n\n在2025最重要的是摸清楚川普的個性，只要掌握此一節奏，在對等關稅引發的市場修正中，反而有機會為投資組合帶來豐收的一年(圖/民視財經網)\n\n回到臺積電的情況，雖然製程技術先進且持續領先競爭對手，由於滿載的狀態，部分客戶或考慮轉向三星或Intel的試單，但預計2026年及2027年仍以臺積電為主。先進封裝及相關測試技術也將持續增長，記憶體產業在需求增長的情況下，對未來報價保持正面看法。\n\n街口投信預測，2026年第一季有望擺脫先前的震盪，並開始走高。儘管全年仍可能因特定因素引發激烈波動，但只要掌握川普的行為模式及產業趨勢，若無過度的黑天鵝事件，預估2026將是持續的多頭市場年度。\n\n《民視新聞網》提醒您：內容僅供參考，投資人於決策時應審慎評估風險，並就投資結果自行負責。\n\n原文出處：2025年股市雲霄飛車：川普動向掀起市場風暴！\n\n更多民視新聞報導伊朗匯率崩！1美元換140萬里爾 最高領袖哈米尼傳將逃往莫斯科靠1檔ETF「領113萬股息」！最後買進日曝…他卻苦惱了高市早苗率內閣團隊參拜伊勢神宮 小野田紀美新年首度亮相引稱讚",

      "Content": "Earnings Preview: What to Expect From NXP Semiconductors’ Report\n\nKritika Sarmah\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 1:37 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nWith a market cap of $55.7 billion, NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) is a leading global semiconductor company headquartered in the Netherlands. It specializes in embedded processing, secure connectivity, and analog solutions, securing a strong competitive position in automotive electronics, which is its largest revenue driver, supplying chips for vehicle networking, safety, infotainment, and software-defined vehicle architectures.\n\nThe company is slated to announce its fiscal Q4 2025 results soon. Ahead of this event, analysts expect NXP Semiconductors to report an EPS of $2.93, a 3.5% increase from $2.83 in the year-ago quarter. It has exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of the past four quarters while missing on another occasion.\nMore News from Barchart Tesla Stock Has Been Flat For 2 Months - How to Make a 3.2% Yield in One-Month Puts\nCES 2026, Sector Rotation and Other Key Things to Watch this Week\nStocks Set to Open Higher as Investors Stay Calm Despite Venezuela Tumult, U.S. Jobs Data Awaited\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter.

However, EPS is anticipated to grow 18.1% year-over-year to $12.07 in fiscal 2026.\nShares of NXP Semiconductors have surged 7.3% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 16.9% increase and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF's (XSD) 33.1% surge over the same period.\nOn Dec. 19, Shares of NXP Semiconductors rose 2.6% in afternoon trading after Truist Securities analyst William Stein raised his price target on the stock to $265 from $254 while reaffirming a “Buy” rating, signaling increased confidence in the company’s valuation. The move was also supported by broader optimism across the semiconductor sector, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence, data centers, and high-performance computing, which continues to underpin expectations of sustained industry growth.\n\nAnalysts' consensus view on NXPI stock remains bullish, with an overall \"Strong Buy\" rating. Out of 30 analysts covering the stock, 22 recommend a \"Strong Buy,\" two \"Moderate Buys,\" and six \"Holds.\" The average analyst price target for NXP Semiconductors is $259.29, indicating a potential upside of 17.2% from the current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Kritika Sarmah did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "A Look At IREN (NasdaqGS:IREN) Valuation After Microsoft AI Deal And New Share Registration\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 1:12 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: IREN\n\nBTC-USD\n\nMSFT\n\nIREN (NasdaqGS:IREN) drew fresh attention after filing a US$660.975m shelf registration covering 17,500,000 ordinary shares tied to its 2025 Omnibus Incentive Plan, alongside progress on its US$9.7b Microsoft AI cloud contract.\nSee our latest analysis for IREN.\nThe 13.05% 1 day share price return to US$42.70 comes after a tough few months, with a 90 day share price return of a 30.77% decline. At the same time, the 1 year total shareholder return of 262.79% and the very large 3 year total shareholder return show how strongly sentiment has swung around this high beta mix of bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure, as investors weigh growth potential against dilution risk and higher short interest.\n\nIf IREN's AI and crypto mix has grabbed your attention, it could be a good moment to scan other high growth tech and AI names through high growth tech and AI stocks for fresh ideas.\nWith a 1 year total return above 260%, fresh short interest near 15% and a large Microsoft AI contract in play, you have to ask yourself: is IREN still mispriced, or is the market already baking in years of future growth?\nMost Popular Narrative: 55% Undervalued According to BlackGoat, the narrative fair value of US$94.84 sits well above IREN's last close at US$42.70. This frames a sizable upside gap before you even factor in its Microsoft contract and AI expansion plans.\nRead the complete narrative.\nWhat earnings ramp justifies that gap? The narrative leans on rapid revenue expansion, rising profit margins and a premium future P/E usually reserved for high growth software names. Curious which assumptions really drive that US$94.84 figure and 55% discount call?\nResult: Fair Value of $94.84 (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, that upside story can break quickly if Bitcoin prices weaken, or if further equity raises and dilution blunt the impact of any future earnings ramp investors are expecting.\nFind out about the key risks to this IREN narrative.\nBuild Your Own IREN Narrative If you are not fully on board with this view or just prefer to weigh the numbers yourself, you can build a custom thesis in minutes with Do it your way\nA great starting point for your IREN research is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards and 3 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking for more investment ideas?

      "Content": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Apple, Dell and One Stop Systems\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, January 5, 2026 at 1:12 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nDELL\n\nOSS\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL – January 5, 2026 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL and One Stop Systems OSS.\nIndustry: Micro-Computers\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2810915/3-stocks-to-watch-from-the-challenging-computer-industry\nThe Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry players are suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Heightened geopolitical challenges post-U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on trade partners are expected to hurt industry participants. Weak demand in China has been a headwind. However, industry participants like Apple , Dell Technologies and One Stop Systems are benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones.\n\nThe improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables, hearables and PCs is another major growth driver for industry participants.\nIndustry Description The Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based on either iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung.\n\nExpanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n3 Micro Computer Industry Trends to Watch Enterprise Adoption Remains Healthy : Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\n\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand : Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\n\nStory Continues\nAI-enabled PCs to Boost Demand : Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be they Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based ones, are expected to benefit from AI infusion. The addition of neural processing units (NPUs), which are dedicated units to manage AI-related tasks, in PCs is a driving demand for AI-enabled devices. AMD, Qualcomm and Intel offer NPU chips with OEMs such as ASUS, Acer, Lenovo, Microsoft, HP and others building these AI-enabled devices. Canalys expects AI-capable PC shipments to make up 50% of PC shipments in 2026. This offers significant growth opportunities for industry participants.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospect The Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #190, which places it in the bottom 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bearish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since March 31, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this industry’s 2026 earnings has moved south by 0.5%.\nGiven the dull outlook, there are only a few stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present those stocks, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500 The Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, as well as the S&P 500, over the past year.\nThe industry has returned 9% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s growth of 19.6% and the broader sector’s appreciation of 27.4%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation On the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 31.06X compared with the S&P 500’s 23.30X and the sector’s 29.55X.\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 31.48X and as low as 26.24X, with the median being 27.69X.\n\n3 Computer Stocks to Watch Right Now One Stop Systems : This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers specialized enterprise-class high-performance compute, high-speed switch fabrics and storage hardware and software. These are designed to target edge applications for AI and machine learning, sensor processing, sensor fusion and autonomy. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOne Stop’s product pipeline is expanding across leading defense organizations and advanced commercial enterprises. The company is investing in next-generation product development and advancing new program opportunities that are expected to contribute to positive bookings growth in 2026 and 2027. Increase exposure on the P-8 Poseidon Reconnaissance aircraft program bodes well for OSS.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 earnings has been steady at 8 cents per share over the past 30 days. The stock has appreciated 113.4% in a year.\nDell Technologies : This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers, driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. The growing demand for AI-enabled PCs is contributing to its Client Solutions Group’s (CSG) revenue growth.\n\nDell Technologies’ ongoing PC refresh cycle has been noteworthy. The company’s leadership emphasized that the transition to Windows 11 is not yet finished. About 500 million PCs that can run Windows 11 are still waiting for upgrades.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings has been steady at $9.89 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has appreciated 11% in a year.\nApple : This Zacks Rank #3 company’s prospects ride on continued iPhone 16 series sales and strong iPhone 17 series adoption. Apple now expects the December quarter’s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) iPhone sales to grow in double digits year over year.\nServices, which comprises Apple’s advertising business, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital content (Arcade, Music, Fitness+, TV, News+) and Payment services (Apple Card & Apple Pay), is riding on an expanding base of installed devices. Apple’s Services segment benefits from an expanding games portfolio and the growing popularity of Apple TV+. Apple’s strategy of adding new games on a continuous basis is driving its user base. Apple TV+ is benefiting from an expanding content portfolio.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has increased 7 cents to $8.11 per share over the past 60 days. Apple shares have increased 9% in the trailing 12-month period.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

      "Content": "ASIC大廠創意今（5）日公布最新營收表現，2025年12月合併營收達47.4億元，月增20.6%、年增75.7%；第四季營收124億元，季增44%、年增逾1倍。累計2025年全年營收達341.4億元，年增36.3%。\n\n今日股價表現同樣兩眼，創意今日股價大漲6.18%，收在2,320元。\n\n業界觀察，創意長期深耕ASIC設計與IP（矽智財）領域，加上與台積電緊密合作的供應鏈位置，使其更容易切入美系大型客戶與雲端服務供應商（CSP）專案，成為近年營運成長的重要推力。\n\n創意總經理戴尚義先前在法說會上指出，CSP相關訂單預計自2025年下半年開始放量，AI相關營收占比將提升至約25%，並在2026年至少維持相同水準。隨著CSP訂單接棒原本由加密貨幣客戶帶動的成長動能，公司整體營運可望持續向上。\n\n公司強調，未來NRE（委託設計）將是重點方向之一，希望持續提升NRE的接單量與實現率，可進一步拉升公司整體毛利率表現。\n\n法人分析，若創意後續能穩定取得大型CSP或AI資料中心客戶的客製化晶片專案，將有助於提升中長期營收能見度；不過，仍須留意產能排程與客戶產品生命週期變動等潛在風險。\n\n更多中時新聞網報導如果單身無子 將來找誰處理後事？必做3件事 避免曹西平乾兒子之痛2026漲價第1槍！被動元件龍頭國巨有動作了 最新通知曝光 分析師點名「這3檔」：長線布局首選60億科技大廠無預警關廠！股價大逃殺跌停 1.1萬張排隊搶賣",

      "Content": "MoneyDJ新聞 2026-01-05 16:28:42 新聞中心 發佈\n\n美國股市上周五雖然漲跌互見，但台灣加權指數今(5)日在台積電(2330)強勢表現下，順利衝破3萬點整數大關，最高來到30,339.32點，再刷歷史新高紀錄。中國信託投信今日表示，觀察上周資金流向，台股最受外資青睞，整體買超達10.4億美元，買超金額為新興亞股之冠，其次為買超印尼1.2億美元，買超越南0.6億美元。在賣超部分，上周以印度遭外資拋售15.4億美元為最多，其次為南韓賣超3.2億美元，泰國賣超0.2億美元。\n\n在指數漲跌部分，中國信託投信指出，上周股市表現與資金流向未同步，在聖誕節及元月行情加持下，亞股普遍呈現收漲，其中，南韓上漲4.4%最多，其次為越南上漲3.2%，台股上漲2.8%，印尼上漲2.5%，而菲律賓、印度也分別小漲1.1%及0.8%，泰國則持平。\n\n台股在AI需求爆發、台積電領軍下，加權指數已順利衝破3萬大關，後續該如何觀察？中國信託台灣活力基金經理人徐啟葳表示，全球大型雲端服務供應商(Cloud Service Provider)資本支出年增率持續強勁，巨大的資本支出代表AI著算力處於供不應求的狀態，這將持續驅動整個AI供應鏈，包括電源供應、液冷散熱、高階PCB/CCL等硬體領域的結構性成長。\n\n徐啟葳指出，今(2026)年AI服務的滲透率將是觀察重點，特別是當前AI在企業端的滲透率相當低，但其一旦採用，通常是高價值、高頻率的服務，如Copilot輔助程式設計，這對服務商的自由現金流和投入資本報酬率(ROIC)將有實質貢獻，有益於股價持續維持正向。另外，對於雲端服務供應商而言，目前最大的挑戰是如何將基礎設施的滲透率轉換為足夠的收入。\n\n而AI強勁需求也催動台灣出口及投資動能，主計總處大幅上修2025年經濟成長率至7.37%，徐啟葳認為，在此高基期下，2026年經濟成長率也有3.54%，不過，隨著2025年基期墊高、大盤指數創高的情況下，預期2026年加權指數雖有機會持續表現，但成長幅度或許較2025年低，整體來說，AI仍為領盤主流，但受到世代轉換、設計轉換等影響，選股難度增加。\n\n另外，越南股市方面，中國信託越南機會基金經理人張晨瑋指出，短線市場聚焦越南政治議題，2026年第一季越南即將迎來新屆黨政領導層，根據歷史經驗，近兩次全代會閉幕後，市場普遍視為政治不確定性消除，越南股市將迎來正向行情，在全代會後的三個月、半年、一年胡志明指數皆呈現正報酬。此外，2025年12月下旬，現任總書記蘇林在中央委員會會議稱，黨內已就新屆關鍵領導層取得共識，市場普遍解讀為政權將平穩過渡，原班人馬可能續任，也給市場帶來更多信心。\n\n張晨瑋補充，從越南經濟數據顯示，2025年前11個月工業生產年增維持雙位數，同月越南製造業採購經理人指數(PMI)達53.8點，續居年內相對高位。另外，海內外有多家機構預測，2025年越南GDP成長有望達到8%目標，而2026年由公共投資作為主引擎，有望維持高速經濟成長。值得留意的是，2025年前11月越南海外直接投資已落實金額達236億美元，再度寫下近年新高，亞馬遜、日本住友等跨產業公司均表示擴大越南投資，反映外資對本地消費、製造業等多元題材興趣濃厚，越南在外資持續挹注下，將促進經濟及股市增長。",

      "Content": "繼Aletheia Capita將台積電目標價提高到2400元之後，高盛也將台積電的投資平等列入亞太區首選買進清單，目標價喊到2330元。受到外資升評激勵，台積電今天大漲90元，股價一舉突破1600元，盤中最高來到1685元漲幅逾6％，同時也帶動台股衝破3萬點大關，同創歷史新高。\n\n針對兩大外資大動作的升評表現，沈萬鈞5日在《萬鈞法人視野 WJ Capital Perspective》中指出，TPU、AWS與NVIDIA正積極爭奪台積電先進製程產能，導致出貨預估大幅變動，台積電目前的瓶頸並非「需求」，而是「物理供給」。隨著2026年先進製程產能正式浮上檯面，台積電在供給端的物理限制（如無塵室、先進封裝）下，將展現強大的稀缺價值。\n\n針對兩大外資報告內容，沈萬鈞做出了以下差異分析：\n\n沈萬鈞表示：高盛與Aletheia雖然同步看多，但在財務模型與成長動力的觀察上展現了不同的側重點。\n\n生產力推升毛利率60%成為新常態 高盛將目標價上調至2330元。其模型建立在「可實現的穩健路徑」上，預期AI GPU/ASIC需求將驅動3nm與5nm維持滿載，並加速往2nm遷移。高盛特別強調「生產力優化」與「海外廠稀釋影響低於預期」兩大關鍵，預期台積電毛利率將結構性墊高至60%以上。根據其預測，2026/2027年營收預估分別為4.772/6.109兆台幣，EPS則預計達到82.56/105.93元。\n\n先進封裝與產能翻倍的「暴力成長」 相較之下，Aletheia給出了更為激進的2400元目標價，預測2026/2027年EPS分別可達97/120元。其核心邏輯在於台積電將於2025至2028年將<5nm先進產能直接「翻倍」，並大膽將200mm舊廠轉型為先進封裝基地。Aletheia指出，先進封裝的價值密度是傳統晶圓的5～10倍，這將成為台積電除了晶圓代工外的第二具成長引擎。\n\n在資本支出（Capex）方面，兩大外資也展現不同思維。高盛預計2026～2028年總支出將超過1500億美元，反映出在無塵室約束下的有序擴張。而Aletheia則描繪了一幅更宏大的擴張地圖，預期2027年將迎來台積電史上最激進的產能擴張，年增率高達40～50%，並強調即便支出拉高，因營收（分母）成長更快，現金流仍足以支撐高配息。\n\n台積電的核心投資邏輯已不再是「AI是否有泡沫」，而是「算力與封裝需求在2027年前仍將供給完全鎖死」。沈萬鈞談到，若以高盛的路徑作為「基本假設（Base Case）」，2027年EPS站穩100元具備極高勝率；而Aletheia則提供了更具想像力的「上行情境（Upside Scenario）」，雖然需面臨產能開出與良率進程的執行風險，但先進封裝戰場的價值密度確實正在被重新定義。隨著外資法人集體上修獲利預期，台積電正帶領台股進入結構性的獲利階梯。\n\n（封面示意圖／翻攝Pixabay）\n\n更多東森財經新聞報導中國彎道超車打造EUV？ ASML執行長不忍了：落後至少8世代PC漲價潮要來了？ 華碩、聯想預告：「這天起」調漲價格台積電「3奈米量產」提前1年 對決三星2奈米",

      "Content": "【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】周一由台積電領軍，亞洲科技股表現強勢，尤其是晶片股。雖然投資人仍然擔心AI股過熱、估值過高，但顯然更害怕錯失進一步走高的機會，在資金持續湧進下，科技股再度成為亞洲主要股市「史詩級大躍進」的最大推手。\n\n華爾街大行高盛將台積電目標股價調升35%，至新台幣2330元，稱看好這家全球晶片代工龍頭未來一年營運仍將穩健成長。此外，上周五儘管美股標普500指數僅收漲0.19%，那斯達克指數更收跌0.03%，但費城半導體指數異軍突起，飆漲了4.01%，台積電ADR大漲逾5%並創下歷史新高，其先進AI晶片大客戶之一輝達收漲1.26%。\n\n受此激勵，周一，由台積電大漲5.36%領軍，台股終場上漲2.57%，收在30,105.04點，首度創下3萬點重大里程碑。台積電盤中一度漲近7%或110元，最高觸及1695元，創下史上新高。\n\n財政部政務次長暨國安基金執行秘書周一在立法院接受質詢時表示，以前覺得3萬點好像很難達到，今天就做到了，這次台股衝破3萬點，主要是關鍵產業發揮重大作用，「確實台積電貢獻很大」。但他也表示，還是希望看到更平衡的市場結構。\n\n上周末美國突襲委內瑞拉並將其總統馬杜洛（Nicolas Maduro）押送到紐約受審，但市場對此反應冷淡。\n\n包括Bruce Lu在內，高盛分析師出具報告指出，我們認為AI將成為台積電未來多年的成長引擎。Bruce Lu表示，台積電的利潤還在持續提升，儘管他預期未來三年台積電砸下1500億美元擴充產能。\n\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co.出具報告指出，就尖端半導體而言，台積電的產能決定一切。今年AI題材仍是關鍵所在，但基於「泡沫」疑慮，建議投資人聚焦「高品質標的」，而台積電正是最具代表性的個股之一。\n\n至於其他亞洲晶片股，南韓三星電子飆漲7.47%，連漲第5天，帶動周一韓股大漲超過3%，再創收盤新高。該記憶體大廠將於本周公布初估財報，這將有助於投資人判斷其近來股價大漲是否合理？\n\n日本半導體設備大廠東京威力科創（Tokyo Electron）大漲7.60%，愛德萬測試（Advantest）大漲7.84%，激勵周一日經225指數終場漲近3%。\n\n中國IC投資基金提高對中芯國際的持股，以及DeepSeek發布更具效率的AI訓練方法，中國晶片股走高。",

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】台積電（2330）5日一夫當關，激勵台股大步跨越3萬點大關，外資扮演重要推手。高盛證券將推測合理股價喊上2,330元、調研機構ALETHEIA喊出2,400元，締造市場過往不敢想像的新天價。\n\n高盛證券認為，AI為驅動台積電多年成長的核心引擎，隨詞元（token）量呈指數型成長，使矽晶圓持續供不應求，產能吃緊態勢預期將延續至2027年。在此背景下，高盛預期，台積電營收與資本支出將同步加速，2026～2028年資本支出合計將超過1,500億美元；同時，在生產力改善與海外建廠稀釋效應轉趨溫和的支撐下，可望支撐台積電毛利率結構性向上。\n\nAI GPU／ASIC將於2026年由5奈米製程升級至3奈米製程，高盛認為，5與3奈米製程2026～2027年產能將持續滿載。鑒於亮眼的產能利用率，高盛將台積電2026、2027年美元計價營收年增率從各22％，上調至年增30％與28％。（新聞來源：工商即時 簡威瑟）",

      "Content": "A Look At Amazon (AMZN) Valuation As AI And Cloud Growth Renew Investor Interest\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 10:10 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nRecent commentary on Amazon.com (AMZN) is centering on a pickup in its core engines, with Amazon Web Services, AI heavy digital advertising, and more efficient e-commerce operations renewing interest in the stock.\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com.\nDespite the latest 1 day and 7 day share price declines, Amazon.com’s current share price of US$226.50 sits against a three year total shareholder return of about 159%, with momentum recently softer as investors weigh AI driven growth news against valuation and insider selling headlines.\n\nIf AI, cloud and e commerce are on your radar, this could be a good moment to widen your watchlist with high growth tech and AI stocks for more potential ideas beyond Amazon.\nWith Amazon now at US$226.50, a 3 year total shareholder return near 159%, solid reported revenue and net income growth, and a flagged intrinsic discount of about 40%, key questions arise: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 3.5% Undervalued According to Zwfis, the narrative fair value of US$234.75 sits slightly above Amazon.com's last close at US$226.50, framing the stock as modestly discounted in their view.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how an 8% discount rate, double digit revenue growth and a rich future earnings multiple come together? The narrative stitches these into a single fair value roadmap that challenges the current price. Want to see which profit assumptions do the heavy lifting in that US$234.75 figure?\n\nResult: Fair Value of $234.75 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this storyline still depends on AWS growth holding up and on management turning heavy AI and infrastructure spending into profits rather than just higher costs.\nFind out about the key risks to this Amazon.com narrative.\nAnother Angle On Value So far the focus has been on fair value estimates and narrative assumptions, but the current P/E of 31.7x adds a different twist. It sits well above the global multiline retail industry at 19.4x, yet slightly below peers at 33.4x and the fair ratio of 40.4x.\nThat mix points to a market that already prices in a premium business, but not all the way up to where the fair ratio suggests sentiment might change. This leaves investors weighing whether this premium looks more like valuation risk or potential room for a rerating.\n\nStory Continues\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own Amazon.com Narrative If you see the numbers differently, or just like testing your own assumptions, you can spin up a personalized Amazon.com view in minutes: Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Amazon.com research is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards and 1 important warning sign that could impact your investment decision.\n\nLooking for more investment ideas? If you are serious about building a stronger portfolio, do not stop at one stock. Use curated stock lists to quickly spot ideas that fit your approach.\nTarget potential mispricing by reviewing these 875 undervalued stocks based on cash flows that align with your view on cash flow and price.\nBack your AI thesis with real tickers by scanning these 25 AI penny stocks that tie growth stories to actual business metrics.\nLock in potential income streams by checking these 14 dividend stocks with yields > 3% and see which payouts might suit your goals.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "【時報記者張漢綺台北報導】台積電(2330)秀股價肌肉，台股指數3萬點到手再創新高！\n\n今天台股可說是台積電一家公司的武林，靠著上週五美國掛牌ADR收盤股價大漲逾5%的底氣，台積電一開盤就展現驚人氣勢，跳空大漲站上1600元，以1630元開出，隨後在外資法人買盤簇擁下，股價開高走高，盤中一度大漲110元，攻抵1695元，直逼1700元，再創上市天價，權王狂飆，權值股也跟著上，台達電(2308)、光寶科(2301)、鴻海(2317)、廣達(2382)、世芯-KY(3661)、聯發科(2454)、創意(3443)、智邦(2345)聯袂走高，台積電供應商亦沾喜氣同樂，弘塑(3131)、均華(6640)、印能(7734)、家登(3680)亮燈漲停，志聖(2467)、漢唐(2404)及汎銓(6830)走揚收紅，搭配啟碁(6285)、雙鍵(4764)、華東(8110)、雷科(6207)、長興(1717)、力成(6239)、旺宏(2337)、昇陽半導體(8028)、鈺創(5351)、睿生光電(6861)及創控(6909)等股價漲停，推升台股指數一度攻抵30339.32點，大漲逾950點，再創台股指數新高，但台積電大展雄威，害慘了中小型股，即使是股王信驊(5274)與即將在本週舉行法說會的大立光(3008)也撐不住，熱門股金居(8358)、定穎(3715)、川湖(2059)、鴻勁(7769)、IET-KY(4971)、環宇-KY(4991)、波若威(3163)及旺矽(6223)等齊跌，中小型股倒一片，成為一個台股兩個世界，尾盤時台積電漲幅縮小，指數小幅拉回，不過仍緊緊站穩3萬點關卡，再創台股指數新高，終場加權股價指數30105.04點，大漲755.23點，成交量7658.07億元；OTC指數為275.66點，下跌2.37點，成交量1774.76億元。\n\n今天上市各類股中以半導體類股表現最佳，上漲4.72%，其次是化工類股及其他電子類股，分別上漲2.02%及1.29%；表現較差者為玻璃類股、運動類股、塑膠類股，其中玻璃類股下跌2.62%，運動類股下跌2.18%，塑膠類股下跌1.81%；上櫃部分，表現最佳為化工類股、上漲2.15%，表現最差為光電類股、下跌2.99%。\n\n就技術面來看，今天台股在台積電帶動下，指數開高走高，一度大漲逾950點，終場上漲755.23點，以30105.04點作收，站上3萬點，再創新高；近期台股指數驚驚漲，繼上周五這根實體大紅K棒，今天再以長紅站上3萬點，目前台股指數不僅站在所有均線之上，呈現標準的多頭排列，且上檔已無壓力，KD指標與RSI指標同步向上，顯示短線動能強勁；MACD紅柱體持續放大，代表多方力道正在加速集結，在技術面毫無敗象的情況下，拉回找買點仍是目前最順勢的操作邏輯。\n\n主動復華未來50經理人呂宏宇表示，台灣最新景氣對策信號燈號續呈黃紅燈，加以年底旺季效應帶動零售批發餐飲業營業額增溫，AI應用需求強勁則使製造業信心改善，領先及同時指標同步上升顯示國內景氣穩健成長，凸顯台股因為有基本面支撐，加上今年整體企業獲利成長預估仍有機會達兩位數，吸引開年以來資金陸續回流，持續看好台股後市表現，若遇震盪建議可逢低分批布局。",

      "Content": "台股今（5）日盤中一飛沖天，大漲近千點至30,339.32點，首度攻破3萬點整數關卡、再創歷史新高。針對外界高度關注國安基金後續動向，以及今年是否又是台積電「一個人的武林」，國安基金執行秘書、財政部政務次長阮清華回應，希望產業發展可以更平衡，同時國安基金尊重市場機制，不會壓抑台股，在正式退場前也「不會賣股」干預市場走勢。\n\n立法院財政委員會今天邀集相關部會，就115年度總預算與國安議題進行專案報告。國民黨立委羅明才質詢時關切，台股是否能夠穩站3萬點，並詢問市場傳聞政府是否透過國安基金或八大行庫「壓盤」，避免指數漲勢過快。對此，阮清華直言，股市本就難以預測，但就產業面來看，台灣在AI與高速運算等關鍵領域「站在對的一方」，整體產業發展前景看好。\n\n針對「壓盤」傳聞，阮清華進一步澄清，國安基金在正式退場前「不會賣股」，也不會刻意干預市場走勢；即便未來經委員會決議啟動退場機制，也不可能在一、兩天內大量出清，將持續觀察市場狀況、循序調整。他也反問指出，「今天台股已經站上3萬點」，顯示並不存在壓抑指數的情形。\n\n民進黨立委李坤城則表示，樂見台股站上3萬點里程碑，但提醒這波行情中台積電貢獻度極高，需留意產業結構是否過度集中，避免台股淪為「一個人的武林」。\n\n對此，阮清華坦言，這次台股衝破3萬點，確實是關鍵產業發揮重大作用，其中台積電貢獻尤為顯著。他指出，台積電股價每上漲1元，約可帶動加權指數上漲8點，今天台積電盤中最高上漲105元，對大盤的貢獻度高達700至800點，是指數創高的重要推手。\n\n阮清華也直言，目前產業發展確實出現「兩極化」現象，AI、高科技與高速運算相關產業表現亮眼，但部分傳統產業相對承壓。政府已意識到相關問題，未來將透過跨部會合作，協助傳統產業升級轉型，推動產業結構更為均衡發展，而非僅由單一產業或單一企業獨領風騷。\n\n回顧背景，美國總統川普於去年4月宣布對台課徵32%對等關稅，曾重創市場信心，台股4月7日單日重挫2065點，創史上最大跌點；國安基金隨後於4月8日決議進場護盤，為該基金第九度進場。如今台股不僅收復失土，更一舉站上3萬點關卡，也讓國安基金後續策略備受矚目。\n\n對於外界關心的退場時點，阮清華重申，國安基金退場與否及具體時程，均須由委員會共同討論決議，屆時將審慎評估市場情勢，確保市場穩定為最高原則。",

      "Content": "台股今（5）日盤中一飛沖天，大漲近千點至30,339.32點，首度攻破3萬點整數關卡、再創歷史新高。針對外界高度關注國安基金後續動向，財政部政務次長暨國安基金操盤手阮清華強調，國安基金尊重市場機制，不會壓抑台股，在正式退場前也「不會賣股」干預市場走勢。\n\n立法院財政委員會今天邀集相關部會，就115年度總預算與國安議題進行專案報告。國民黨立委羅明才質詢時關切，台股是否能夠穩站3萬點，並詢問市場傳聞政府是否透過國安基金或八大行庫「壓盤」，避免指數漲勢過快。對此，阮清華直言，股市本就難以預測，但就產業面來看，台灣在AI與高速運算等關鍵領域「站在對的一方」，整體產業發展前景看好。\n\n針對「壓盤」傳聞，阮清華進一步澄清，國安基金在正式退場前「不會賣股」，也不會刻意干預市場走勢；即便未來經委員會決議啟動退場機制，也不可能在一、兩天內大量出清，將持續觀察市場狀況、循序調整。他也反問指出，「今天台股已經站上3萬點」，顯示並不存在壓抑指數的情形。\n\n民進黨立委李坤城則表示，樂見台股站上3萬點里程碑，但提醒這波行情中台積電貢獻度極高，需留意產業結構是否過度集中，避免台股淪為「一個人的武林」。\n\n對此，阮清華坦言，這次台股衝破3萬點，確實是關鍵產業發揮重大作用，其中台積電貢獻尤為顯著。他指出，台積電股價每上漲1元，約可帶動加權指數上漲8點，今天台積電盤中最高上漲105元，對大盤的貢獻度高達700至800點，是指數創高的重要推手。\n\n阮清華也直言，目前產業發展確實出現「兩極化」現象，AI、高科技與高速運算相關產業表現亮眼，但部分傳統產業相對承壓。政府已意識到相關問題，未來將透過跨部會合作，協助傳統產業升級轉型，推動產業結構更為均衡發展，而非僅由單一產業或單一企業獨領風騷。\n\n回顧背景，美國總統川普於去年4月宣布對台課徵32%對等關稅，曾重創市場信心，台股4月7日單日重挫2065點，創史上最大跌點；國安基金隨後於4月8日決議進場護盤，為該基金第九度進場。如今台股不僅收復失土，更一舉站上3萬點關卡，也讓國安基金後續策略備受矚目。\n\n對於外界關心的退場時點，阮清華重申，國安基金退場與否及具體時程，均須由委員會共同討論決議，屆時將審慎評估市場情勢，確保市場穩定為最高原則。",

That came after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its TSMC price target 35% to NT$2,330, citing expectations of another year of solid growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinkholes and Quake-Hit Roads Expose Japan’s Infrastructure Emergency\nTSMC helped lead a broad charge in Asian tech stocks Monday as investors plow more cash into the AI theme despite concerns of overheating. The sector was once again the biggest boost to regional equities as fear of missing out on further gains overcame concerns of short-term volatility in the wake of US strikes against Venezuela.\n“We view AI as a multi-year growth engine for TSMC,” Goldman analysts including Bruce Lu wrote in a report. Lu notes the company’s profit margins are improving, even as he projects it will spend $150 billion over the next three years to increase capacity.\nAmong other chip stocks, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. extended gains to a fifth-straight session. The memory maker is expected to report preliminary results later this week that will provide further clues on the whether earnings justify the sector’s big gains.\nTSMC shares surged 44% in 2025, pushing its market value above $1 trillion for the first time. That reflects increased investor confidence in its central position amid the AI boom, with many of the world’s chip companies relying on its foundry services.\n\n“For leading-edge semiconductor, capacity from TSMC is the king,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts including Mark Li wrote in a note dated Friday. This year “is still all about AI,” though the analysts recommend investors “focus on quality” given worries of a bubble.\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nOzempic Users Actually Spend More Dining Out.

      "Content": "Ready to Buy Nvidia Stock? Check Out This Option.\n\nLyle Daly, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 7:51 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's financials continue to improve.\nIts GPUs are in high demand from AI companies.\nIf you're unsure whether to load up on Nvidia stock now, another option is dollar-cost averaging -- putting smaller investments on auto-pilot.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just finished up another great year. The stock rose 39% in 2025 and looking at recent earnings reports, for the first three quarters of its 2026 fiscal year (the nine-month period ending Oct. 26, 2025), the chipmaker's revenue increased 62% year over year. Gross profit increased 48%, and net income increased 52%.\nExpectations are high for this year, especially after management revealed an order backlog of $500 billion through the end of 2026. However, Nvidia is trading at an expensive 46 times trailing earnings. With that in mind, should you buy Nvidia stock now or wait for a cheaper opportunity?\nHow to buy Nvidia shares There's a lot to like about Nvidia as an investment. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand from other AI companies, which is the primary reason its revenue has exploded. Data center revenue made up 90% of Nvidia's total revenue in its most recent quarter. It's certainly a quality company to have in your portfolio, particularly if you're looking for top AI stocks . Excellent companies often trade at high valuations, so you shouldn't let its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) dissuade you from investing.\n\nThat said, it's normal to question how much more Nvidia can grow if there is a pullback in the near future. It's the largest public company by market cap as I write this, and the valuation is high, although reasonable compared to most AI companies. For perspective, competitor Advanced Micro Devices trades at 106 times trailing earnings, making Nvidia look like a bargain in comparison.\nIf you're concerned about investing too heavily in Nvidia all at once, dollar-cost averaging is a good alternative. This mans buying a fixed amount of Nvidia stock on a schedule that works for you. For example, you could purchase one or two shares each week no matter what the stock is doing.\nI've dollar-cost averaged into many tech stocks I like, Nvidia included. It's a useful strategy for volatile stocks because even if the share price declines, you'll have the opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

While diverse, the way people buy and experience these products is being upended by the internet and digitization. Consumer discretionary companies are working to adapt to secular trends such as streaming video, online marketplaces for lodging accommodations, and connected fitness. That discretionary purchases are, by definition, something consumers can give up makes it even more imperative for companies in the space to adapt.\n\nThe 152 consumer discretionary stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.6% above.\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 2% on average since the latest earnings results.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Creator of the iPhone and App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\nApple reported revenues of $102.5 billion, up 7.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 0.8%.

      "Content": "Is Microsoft Attractively Priced After AI Partnerships and Cloud Expansion in 2026?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 7:08 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nIf you have ever wondered whether Microsoft is still a buy at today’s levels, you are not alone. This article is designed to cut through the noise and focus on what the stock is actually worth.\nDespite a modest pullback of around 3.0% over the last week and a roughly flat start to the year, long term holders have still seen the share price climb about 12.5% over the last year and more than 115.3% over three years.\nRecent headlines have focused on Microsoft’s continued push into artificial intelligence partnerships and cloud infrastructure, alongside regulatory scrutiny around big tech dominance globally. Together, these themes help explain why the market has been quick to reprice the stock whenever sentiment on growth or regulation shifts.\nRight now, Microsoft scores a 4 out of 6 on our valuation checks . This suggests it may be undervalued on several fronts. We will walk through what that means using different valuation approaches, before ending with a more intuitive way to think about the company’s true worth.\n\nMicrosoft delivered 12.5% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Software industry.\nApproach 1: Microsoft Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those cash flows back to today in $ terms.\nFor Microsoft, the latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is about $89.4 billion. Based on analyst forecasts and Simply Wall St’s extrapolations, free cash flow is projected to rise to roughly $369.8 billion by 2035, with intermediate steps such as around $206.2 billion by 2030. These projections assume robust growth over the next decade as Microsoft continues to scale its cloud and AI businesses.\n\nUsing a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, these future cash flows are discounted back to today to arrive at an estimated intrinsic value of about $604.22 per share. Compared to the current market price, this implies the stock is trading at roughly a 21.7% discount, suggesting the shares are materially undervalued based on cash flow potential.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Microsoft is undervalued by 21.7%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 875 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Microsoft.\nApproach 2: Microsoft Price vs Earnings For a highly profitable business like Microsoft, the price to earnings, or PE, ratio is a useful way to gauge whether the market price makes sense relative to the company’s current profit engine. Investors are generally willing to pay a higher PE for companies with stronger growth prospects and lower perceived risk, while slower growing or riskier firms usually trade on lower, more conservative multiples.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft currently trades on a PE of about 33.5x, which is slightly above the US Software industry average of roughly 31.7x and close to the peer group average of around 32.7x. To move beyond simple comparisons, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio: the PE multiple that would be reasonable given Microsoft’s earnings growth outlook, margins, size, industry and risk profile. This tailored Fair Ratio, at about 51.3x, better reflects the company’s specific strengths than a broad industry or peer average.\nComparing Microsoft’s actual PE of 33.5x to the Fair Ratio of 51.3x suggests the market is pricing the shares below what would be expected for a business of this quality and growth profile.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1464 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Microsoft Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This is a simple framework where you attach a clear story about Microsoft’s future to concrete numbers like fair value, revenue growth, earnings and margins, and then see how that story stacks up against today’s share price.\n\nA Narrative on Simply Wall St links three things together: the business story you believe, the financial forecast that follows from that story, and the resulting fair value estimate. All of this is presented in an accessible tool on the Community page that millions of investors already use.\nOnce you choose or create a Narrative, the platform continuously compares its fair value to Microsoft’s live market price to help you decide whether it looks more like a buy, hold or sell, and automatically updates that view when important news, earnings or guidance changes come in.\nFor example, one Microsoft Narrative on the Community page currently assumes a cautious outlook with fair value closer to about $360 per share, while another assumes robust AI led growth and pegs fair value above $620. This illustrates how two investors can look at the same company, plug in different expectations, and reach very different yet clearly explained conclusions.\n\nFor Microsoft, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Microsoft Narratives:\n🐂 Microsoft Bull Case\nFair value: $624.45 per share\nImplied undervaluation vs current price: approximately 24.2%\nForecast revenue growth: 15.30%\nAssumes AI partnerships and Azure expansion sustain double digit revenue growth and support a durable, high margin cloud and subscription model.\nSees cybersecurity, Microsoft 365 and other recurring subscription revenues driving predictable earnings and free cash flow.\nAccepts elevated AI and data center capex as justified by long term demand, with efficiency gains expected to keep margins broadly stable.\n🐻 Microsoft Bear Case\nFair value: $420.00 per share\nImplied overvaluation vs current price: approximately 12.7%\n\nForecast revenue growth: -0.78%\nArgues that massive AI and data center capex risks turning Microsoft into a lower return, capital intensive utility if AI pricing and demand disappoint.\nHighlights pressure from a shrinking PC market, weak Xbox hardware performance, and deteriorating Windows user experience as structural headwinds.\nWarns that AI tools like Copilot may cannibalize per seat Office revenues while partnership dependence and intensifying competition erode Microsoft’s moat.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Microsoft?

The ChatGPT maker launched its GPT-5.2 AI model a few weeks later.\nRoh expects the adoption of AI to accelerate, as Samsung's surveys on ​awareness of its Galaxy AI brand jumped to a level of 80% from about 30% in just one year.\n\"Even though the AI technology might ‌seem a bit doubtful right now, within six months to a year, these technologies will become more widespread,\" he said.\nWhile search is the most used AI feature on phones, consumers also frequently use a range of generative AI editing and productivity tools for images and others, as well as translation and summary features, he said.\n\n\"NOT IMMUNE\" TO MEMORY CHIP SHORTAGE\nA global shortage of memory chips is a boon to Samsung's mainstay semiconductor business, but pressures margins on the smartphone business, its second largest revenue source.\n\"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,\" Roh said, adding that the crisis affects not ⁠only mobile phones but other consumer electronics, from TVs to home appliances.\n\nStory Continues\nHe did not rule ​out raising product prices, saying some impact was \"inevitable\" from a surge in memory chip prices, ​but Samsung, the world’s No.1 TV maker, is working with partners on longer term strategies to minimise the impact.\nMarket researchers such as IDC and Counterpoint predict the global smartphone market will shrink next year, as the memory chip shortage threatens to drive ‍up phone prices.\n\nRoh said the market for ⁠foldable phones that Samsung pioneered in 2019 has been growing slower than expected.\nHe attributed this to the engineering complexities and lack of applications suitable for the hardware design, but expected the segment to go mainstream in the next two or three years.\nA \"very high\" rate of foldable phone ⁠users opt for the same segment for their next purchase, he said, but gave no details.\nSamsung controlled nearly two-thirds of the foldable smartphone market in the third quarter of 2025, according ‌to Counterpoint.\nBut it faces competition from Chinese companies such as Huawei, as well as Apple, expected to launch its first foldable ‌phone this year.\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Clarence Fernandez)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "MoneyDJ新聞 2026-01-05 10:43:31 數位內容中心 發佈\n\n台積電（2330）宣布2奈米（N2）製程技術如期於2025年第4季開始量產，採用奈米片（Nanosheet）電晶體結構，並在高雄與新竹同步展開生產。公司表示N2在相同功耗下可提升10%至15%效能，或在相同效能下降低25%至30%功耗，晶體管密度提升逾15%。\n\nN2製程引入超高性能金屬絕緣體金屬（SHPMIM）電容設計，據稱可將電容密度提升逾兩倍，同時降低片電阻與通孔電阻約50%，公司並持續優化導線層以改善供電網絡與能效表現。台積電並規劃2026年下半年量產N2P作為N2家族延伸。\n\n高雄22廠為N2首要量產基地，台積電在當地規劃多座廠房分階段投產；公司指出2026年在智慧型手機與高效能運算（HPC）應用需求帶動下，將加速產能提升。媒體報導指出，至2026年底N2產能已接獲大量預訂，且Apple已預訂超過半數產能，用於A20與M6及Vision Pro R2等晶片。\n\n在海外布局方面，台積電持續在亞利桑那、新竹、南科等地擴建先進製程產能；公司並針對1.4奈米等後續製程進行規劃與試產準備。報導也指出台積電將於多地調整產能分配以滿足AI與HPC客戶需求，並擬將部分既有廠房改為先進製程之用。\n\n競爭對手方面，三星與英特爾亦在推動自家GAA或18A等製程量產，但公開數據顯示其首代2奈米或等效製程初期良率與效能提升幅度較為保守。台積電表示其策略是持續強化N2及衍生技術以維持製程領先優勢，但未提供具體良率數字。\n\n資本支出與供應鏈面臨壓力，外界估計台積電在先進製程擴張下的資本支出將顯著增加，公司並指出將透過全球供應鏈協同以支援擴產計畫。\n\n台積電亦在成熟製程與老舊設備處理上採取調整措施，包括出售閒置設備以釋出廠房空間並協助供應鏈夥伴接手既有成熟製程訂單；公司表示此舉屬資源重整以支援先進製程需求。",

      "Content": "【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】周一亞洲早盤時段，已經開盤的日韓台股大漲，台股更一舉突破3萬點大關，美股指數期貨小幅走高，不畏上周末美軍「活捉」委內瑞拉總統尼馬杜洛（Nicolas Maduro）引發的動盪。\n\n目前道瓊指數期貨幾近持平，標普500指數期貨漲0.16%，那斯達克100指數期貨漲0.37%。\n\n亞股方面，受惠於美國晶片股表現強勢，台積電ADR再創新高，目前台股大漲近3%，漲破3萬點大關，再寫新里程碑。在東京，由晶片股和重工業股領軍，日經225指數暫漲2.56%，報51,630.06點。由三星電子和SK海力士飆升帶動，南韓Kospi指數大漲2.27%。\n\n上周六，在美國總統川普下令後，美軍直搗委內瑞拉首都加拉加斯（Caracas）「活捉」其總統馬杜洛夫妻，並將其押送至紐約受審。川普並表示，美國將「接管」這個全球主要產油國，直到我們能進行安全、妥善和恰如其分的交接。\n\n據報導，美國亦敦促自家石油巨頭大舉投資委內瑞拉。知情人士透露，近來白宮和國務院官員已向美國石油企業高層表示，如果他們想要獲得20年前委內瑞拉沒收資產的賠償，就應盡快重返委內瑞拉並大舉投資，以重振當地受創的石油產業。\n\n不過，美國務卿盧比歐似乎有意淡化川普的「接管」說法，稱美國將利用從對該國的石油封鎖和區域軍事部署獲得的影響力，來實現政策目標。\n\n盧比歐周日受訪時表示，這不是接管，也不是要拿下油田，而是要確保在委內瑞拉改革整個石油產業的治理之前，任何受制裁的石油都無法進出。造福委內瑞拉人民的解決之道，是讓非伊朗等國家的民間企業進入委內瑞拉投資建設相關設備。\n\n部分華爾街人士認為美國這次出手對市場的影響有限。儘管委內瑞拉擁有龐大的石油蘊藏，但其每日產量不到100萬桶，佔比不到全球產量的1% 。\n\n上周五（1月2日）、今年第一個交易日，美股道瓊指數漲0.66%，標普500指數收漲0.19%，那斯達克指數跌0.03%，費城半導體指數飆漲4.01%。\n\n就周線來看，道指收跌0.67%，標普500周跌1.03%，那指周跌1.52%。費半指數收漲2.22%，表現亮眼。\n\n本周，市場將密切關注周五發布的12月非農就業報告。根據Dow Jones所做的調查，受訪經濟學家預期12月美國就業新增5.4萬人。",

      "Content": "【財訊快報／記者李純君報導】台股今日開盤剽悍，早盤大漲逾800點，創下30221點新高，而台積電(2330)更是一度大漲100元，來到1685元，創下歷史新高。事實上，美國半導體類股大漲，2日台積電ADR大漲5.17%，收319.61美元，改寫歷史新高，換算台股已經超過2000元。接下來的市場重頭戲，便是台積電將在15日召開的法說會，當中對於產業和景氣的定調，更將成為產業遵循與採用的論述。而業界則盛傳，台積電受惠於NVIDIA的Rubin晶片的訂單加持，加上AI與HPC趨勢下先進製程需求強勁，今年第一季有望繳出史上最強的首季成績單。此外，台積電的2奈米產能規劃的目標總規模至少達到三個五廠區。而外資圈近日則有最新報告出爐，喊出台積電目標2300元以上，營收展望則是因AI加速器市場快速擴大，加上今年有2奈米的放量，今年和明年營收年增率為30%與28%，此外，也關注先進製程、海外擴廠與先進封裝產能建制，台積電今年與未來幾年，年度資本支出是否能達到460-540億美元。",

      "Content": "日期：2026年 1月 5日\n\n※盤勢分析\n\n費半大漲、雙王法說及CES題材熱，台股本周挑戰3萬大關\n\n※昨日盤勢\n\n2026年的第一個交易日，受惠中國擬在2026年向輝達採購超過200萬顆H200\n\n晶片，以及美國政府向台積電核發出口許可，准許其將美國晶片製造設備出口至\n\n中國，台積電再度創1585新天價，也順利帶動指數以29,016點紅盤開出，隨後買\n\n盤源源不絕，指數開高走高，盤中幾乎沒有太大的回檔壓力，終場大漲386點，\n\n收在29,349點，漲幅達1.33%，再度刷新歷史新高紀錄。成交量能配合擴大至\n\n6488億之上，顯示這波攻勢並非虛火，而是有實質買盤進場承接。權值股方面，\n\n台積電上漲2.26%，鴻海上漲0.65%，聯發科上漲2.80%，廣達上漲1.84%，台達電\n\n上漲3.32%。\n\n盤面強勢股，雙鍵、鈞寶、正達、華邦電、旺宏、益登、達興材料、宜特、\n\n點序、均豪、佳必琪等漲停；京元電子、南亞科、群創、華新科、志聖、力積電\n\n、華東、精確、新應材等漲幅6%以上；盤面弱勢股，美利達、金像電、川湖、南\n\n亞、大量、健策、勤誠、富世達、南俊國際等跌幅5%以上。終場台灣加權指數上\n\n漲386.21 點，以29349.81點作收，成交量為6503.13億元。觀察盤面變化，三大\n\n類股漲跌互見，電子上漲1.78%、傳產下跌0.38%、金融上漲0.23%。在次族群部\n\n份，以半導體、光電、電器電纜表現較佳，分別上漲2.34%、2.15%、1.94%。\n\n※資金動向\n\n三大法人合計買超190.63億元。其中外資買超120.18億元，投信賣超41.9億\n\n元，自營商買超112.36億元。外資買超前五大為力積電、華邦電、群創、友達、\n\n緯創；賣超前五大為南亞、玉山金、可寧衛*、亞泥、宏碁。投信買超前五大為\n\n玉山金、亞泥、中信金、宏碁、華邦電；賣超前五大為彰銀、元大金、鴻海、澗\n\n泰新、寶成。資券變化方面，融資增32.25億元，融資餘額為3466.34億元，融券\n\n增1.15萬張，融券餘額為32.54萬張。外資台指期部位，空單減少1905口，淨空\n\n單部位23154口。借券賣出金額為190.67億元。類股成交比重：電子87.18%、傳\n\n產10.34%、金融2.48%。\n\n※今日盤勢分析\n\n國際方面，美軍3日凌晨對委內瑞拉發動大規模軍事打擊，抓走委內瑞拉總\n\n統馬杜洛，並將他強行帶往美國。美國總統川普當天公開宣稱，將接管委內瑞拉\n\n，並宣布美國大型石油企業將進入委內瑞拉。此舉造成美國華盛頓、洛杉磯等\n\n105座美國城市舉行示威活動，同時，哥倫比亞宣布武裝部隊進入一級戰備狀態\n\n，以應對可能升級的局勢。國內方面，台股 2026年開紅盤繳出亮麗成績，指數\n\n收在29349.81 點，盤中與收盤雙寫歷史新高，技術線型走強，配合美股維持強\n\n勢及企業展望正向，台股有望再度放量攻高，加上美國最大國際消費性電子展\n\nCES 2026 與大立光、台積電法說本周起陸續登場，指數有望衝3萬點關卡，惟美\n\n國對委內瑞拉的黑天鵝事件，影響投資人信心，整體預估指數高檔震盪。\n\n台股後市分析如下：第一、中華經濟研究院 2 日公布去年 12 月台灣製造\n\n業PMI 指數續揚3.9 個百分點至 55.3%，不僅連續 3個月擴張，也創 2024 年\n\n6月以來最快擴張速度，且製造業未來六個月展望指數 51.0%，是 4 月美國對等\n\n關稅宣告以來，首次回報樂觀。\n\n第二、輝達（NVIDIA）台灣總部進度再傳新消息。輝達台灣總部簽約儀式可\n\n望趕在農曆年前完成。北士科的都市計畫變更案，政府預計本月將召開都市計畫\n\n審議會，待基地整合完成後，最快可在農曆年前完成簽約。台北市府規劃透過都\n\n市計畫變更，取消T17、T18基地間原有道路縫合，將兩塊基地合併，以提供更完\n\n整、具彈性的開發空間。另輝達執行長黃仁勳月底將再度來台參加台灣分公司尾\n\n牙，相關台股供應鏈有望吹起黃仁勳旋風。\n\n第三、從技術面觀察，上周五這根實體大紅K棒具有指標性意義。指數目前\n\n站在所有均線之上，呈現標準的多頭排列。KD指標與RSI指標同步向上，顯示短\n\n線動能強勁；MACD紅柱體持續放大，代表多方力道正在加速集結。在技術面毫無\n\n敗象的情況下，拉回找買點仍是目前最順勢的操作邏輯。\n\n第四、盤面資金聚焦記憶體、被動元件、台積電概念等族群，包括華邦電、\n\n旺宏、日電貿、立隆電、均豪、台特化等表現強勢。\n\n※投資策略\n\n12 月台灣製造業 PMI 55.3%、CES將在1月6日開展、大立光8日及台積電15\n\n日將舉辦法說會、勞動基金11 月單月賺1168億元、眾利多因素有望帶動台股往3\n\n萬點關卡邁進，預估指數高檔震盪盤堅；惟仍須關注美國出兵委內瑞拉後的政局\n\n變化。操作建議維持分批布局業績題材股與AI相關族群為首選，聚焦：AI概念股\n\n、台積電法說概念、材料升級或短缺概念、高速傳輸(含光傳輸)、PCB族群、電\n\n力能源相關、衛星航太、成衣製鞋及具高殖利率的金控股等族群。",

Qualcomm is trading around $172.98 versus an estimated fair value near $165.41. This suggests the shares are slightly overvalued and raises the question: which story should investors trust?\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out QUALCOMM for example ).

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】在全球供應鏈重組與「美國製造」政策推動之下，台積電加速擴大美國布局，但是高昂的生產成本正對獲利能力形成明顯壓力。Wccftech網站引用SemiAnalysis資料指出，台積電在美國設廠後，單位晶圓毛利率與台灣相比出現巨大落差，主因在於人力成本與晶圓折舊費用大幅攀升。\n\n根據分析師彙整的數據，台積電台灣晶圓廠每片晶圓的人力成本約1,800美元，美國晶圓廠則高達3,600美元，整整高出1倍。在晶圓折舊方面差距更為驚人，台灣廠每片晶圓折舊費用約1,500美元，美國廠卻高達7,289美元，是台灣廠的4倍以上。受此影響，台灣晶圓廠單片晶圓毛利率約62％，美國晶圓廠僅約8％，幾乎只剩八分之一。\n\n所謂晶圓折舊，指的是晶圓廠建設與設備投資在使用年限內的成本攤提。由於美國晶圓廠產能規模與產能利用率相對較低，即便採用相同製程技術，單位產出的固定成本卻必須由更少的晶圓分攤，導致每片晶圓承擔更高的「固定費用」，進一步侵蝕毛利空間。\n\n此外，美國高昂的人力成本亦成為沉重負擔。為支撐美國晶圓廠運作，台積電必須要在聘用當地員工與從台灣派遣工程師之間做出取捨。無論採取何種方式，整體用人成本皆明顯高過於台灣，成為影響營運效率的重要因素。\n\n市場人士指出，這也是台積電亞利桑那州晶圓廠近期出現獲利下滑的主要原因。在建廠成本、營運費用與折舊壓力同步放大的情況下，美國生產晶片的經濟性仍有待時間與規模放大來改善。\n\n儘管短期毛利承壓，台積電推進美國布局的戰略意義依然明確。此舉有助於分散地緣政治風險，確保關鍵客戶在不同地區都能取得穩定產能，也獲得包括輝達在內的重要客戶支持。\n\n業界普遍認為，建立具韌性的美國半導體供應鏈是一項長期工程，台積電勢必在成本與戰略之間持續權衡，但美國擴產方向短期內不會改變。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一陳穎芃／綜合外電報導)",

      "Content": "【財訊快報／魏聖峰】Nasdaq指數上週五雖然小跌，半導體股卻大漲，台積電ADR上漲5.17%、日月光ADR上漲4.72%。Nvidia股價上漲1.26%、美光科技股價上漲10.52%、超微股價上漲4.35%、應用材料股價上漲4.62%，帶動費城半導體指數上漲4.01%，道瓊、S&P 500指數上週五收小紅。從上週五美股與台股表現推測，週一台股可望持續在台積電(2330)、記憶體和大型權值電子股引領下，持續向上攻堅。2026年台股開盤後的第一個交易日表現強勁，加權指數大漲386.21點，漲幅1.33%，指數再刷新歷史新高的29363.43點。櫃買指數也上漲0.65%，盤中也再創波段新高的278.8點。台股會有如此亮眼的表現，與即將在1月8日和1月15日舉行法說會的大立光(3008)與台積電有密切關連，尤其是台積電。最近市場傳出台積電的業績持續暢旺，先進製程供不應求。為此，台積電可能會把CoWoS委外代工給封測業者，連帶帶動最近封測股表現強勁，日月光投控(3711)、京元電子(2449)的股價頻創掛牌新高。台積電從去年第三季起，每季現金股息提高到6元，下一次台積電配息會在3月17日。以台積電每年配息24元，以該公司目前股價1585元的價格來說，股息殖利率僅1.5%，已不是高配息股，但市場持續信心依然強烈，業績不斷成長，短期的3~5年內，台積電先進製程沒有競爭對手，都是台積電的利多。台積電已從去年第四季起正式啟動2奈米量產，台積電的2奈米已被蘋果和Nvidia搶購一空。台積電預估到今年底，2奈米產能可達到8~10萬片。不僅如此，市場傳出美國將放行Nvidia的H200出口到中國，也被中國科技業者搶購，這些多出來的高階晶圓需求，又會讓台積電的業績持續滿載。這就是台積電股價持強的關鍵。看起來，加權指數要攻上3萬點已經近在眼前。台積電CoWoS委外代工，除了讓封測龍頭日月光投控、京元電子業績大好外，將對整個封測股景氣都帶來新的挹注。先前股價漲幅已不小的欣銓(3264)，近期股價高檔震盪，連先前股價不會漲的精材(3374)最近都已開始從低檔強勁反彈。再來就是濕製程設備供應商的弘塑(3131)、辛耘(3583)，點膠、貼合自動化設備的萬潤(6187)，以及封裝和AOI檢測的均豪(5443)、均華(6640)、志聖(2467)、群翊(6664)以及廠務的漢唐(2404)、帆宣(6196)等公司都將受惠這項商機。老AI股經歷先前股價回檔後，最近兩個交易日逐漸轉強，這與加權指數逐漸逼近29000點有關，很多股票漲幅很大，老AI股股價仍在原地不動的話，股價反映出相對低價，吸引市場資金的青睞。神達(3706)經歷11月營收利空和甲骨文股價下跌利空洗禮後，短線股價築底後反彈。神達基本面不差，產能擴張以及幫甲骨文星際們做伺服器代工，後市營運看好。緯創(3231)集團營收超過廣達(2382)集團，緯穎(6669)的股價也築底反彈，廣達、鴻海(2317)的股價進入整理後，逐漸趨向多頭發展，都有利這些老AI股後市表現。還有記憶體股表現也是相當強勁，群聯(8299)和晶豪科(3006)公告11月自結獲利，晶豪科單月EPS 0.92元，超越2025年前三季的獲利表現。群聯11月EPS更達7.9元，激勵最近股價攻高。先前股價進入整理的華邦電(2344)和南亞科(2408)，股價上週五再創新高價。記憶體封裝廠的福懋科(8131)、先前股價漲多正里的南茂(8150)、力成(6239)上週五股價再度轉強，顯示記憶體股的多頭沒有散掉，隨時找機會再攻。國際指標股除了要觀察美光科技股價走勢外，南韓海力士與三星電子的股價變化也都會與台股記憶體相關股有高度連動關係。目前來看，台股在2026年開春後多頭氣勢相當強勁，在很多股價已創新高情況下，若股價有任何的回檔，都可能是買點。",

Discover the 22 US stocks riding the wave .\nTesla Investment Narrative Recap To own Tesla today, you have to believe it can evolve from a slowing EV manufacturer into a broader AI, autonomy and energy platform, with software and storage eventually doing more of the heavy lifting than cars. The latest delivery miss and Tesla’s loss of the EV crown to BYD directly challenge the near term automotive volume story, but do not yet change the key short term catalyst: progress on robotaxi and FSD approvals, particularly outside the U.S., or the biggest current risk of demand and margin pressure as incentives roll off.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Tesla’s record energy storage deployments and the new 500 MW / 1 GWh Matrix Renewables battery deal in the UK underline why many shareholders now watch the energy business almost as closely as vehicle deliveries. These projects show how grid storage could help offset some of the cyclicality and incentive sensitivity of car sales, even if it is still early days for energy to carry the valuation narrative.\nYet, despite this shift, investors still need to be aware that weaker EV demand and shrinking incentives could...\nRead the full narrative on Tesla (it's free!)\nTesla's narrative projects $148.1 billion revenue and $15.4 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Tesla's forecasts yield a $391.35 fair value , a 11% downside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives The 211 fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$67 to over US$2,700 per share, reflecting sharply different views on Tesla’s long term potential.

      "Content": "Veteran analyst delivers blunt 3-word take on Tesla after report\n\nMoz Farooque\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 12:13 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n“ Better than feared. ”\nThat’s the three-word verdict from Wedbush’s Dan Ives after Tesla ( TSLA ) reported its latest lackluster production and delivery numbers.\nWith most leaning bearish, Ives' take wasn’t the reaction investors were expecting.\nTesla’s delivery numbers came in behind internal targets, but landed close enough to Wall Street ’s expectations.\n\nDeliveries are under duress following the loss of the critical $7,500 U.S. tax credit, along with ongoing weakness across Europe. Still, the overall report pointed to stability instead of deterioration.\nHowever, having covered Tesla for years, this isn’t the same EV-centric company it once was.\nIves is echoing the same sentiment, saying investors are judging Tesla on more than just quarterly car deliveries, but also on AI , energy, and autonomy.\nCEO Elon Musk made that point clear on Tesla’s Q4 2024 earnings call .\nFor these reasons, we could see a new-look Tesla, with multiple AI and autonomy catalysts masking weaknesses in its core EV business.\nWhat Tesla’s Q4 numbers say At first glance, Tesla ’s Q4 and full-year 2025 production and delivery report was another headline miss.\nHere’s where the numbers actually stand.\nQ4 2025 deliveries: 418,227 vehicles , about 1.1% behind Tesla’s company-compiled analyst consensus of 422,850 and nearly 3.4% under Visible Alpha’s 432,810 estimate.\nQ4 2025 production: 434,358 vehicles , lagging Bloomberg’s cited consensus of 470,780 by about 7.7% .\nFull-year 2025 deliveries: 1,636,129 vehicles , mostly in line with Tesla’s compiled consensus of 1,640,752 and close to third-party expectations of about 1.65 million .\nFull-year 2025 production: 1,654,667 vehicles , which means Tesla produced slightly more than it delivered.\nEnergy storage (Q4): 14.2 GWh deployed , a record quarter , beating Tesla’s compiled consensus of 13.4 GWh by nearly 6% .\n\nIves sees Tesla on firm ground heading into 2026 Veteran Tesla bull Dan Ives feels the gap between production and delivery numbers was small enough to avoid raising any major red flags.\nIves also believes that Tesla faces significant challenges in achieving delivery growth again, particularly after the loss of the EV tax credit in Q3 and European headwinds.\n\nHowever, with deliveries more or less matching expectations, he feels Tesla enters 2026 in a strong position.\nRelated: Top analyst resets price target on Micron stock\nPerhaps the brightest spot is its energy business, where deployments jumped to 46.7 gigawatt-hours for the year.\nMore importantly, though, Ives reiterated the importance of AI, Full Self-Driving, Optimus robotics, and Robotaxis in 2026.\nHe keeps a buy rating on Tesla stock, with a massive $600 price target .\nFor perspective, that’s the highest rating on Wall Street.\nAnalysts stay divided on Tesla’s upside from here Tesla stock is currently trading near $438 after releasing its latest delivery report.\nThe past week has been tough for the stock (down 8%), but it capped off 2025 in the green, delivering a 16% gain .\nWhen I last covered Tesla stock (December 18, 2025), it was trading at $483.37 , so it has since declined by roughly 9.4% .\n\nRelated: Morgan Stanley drops surprising message on tech stocks\nNevertheless, it’s still trading at what bears would call a nosebleed valuation , at 268 times non-GAAP forward earnings .\nThat said, here’s where the big banks and major analysts are pegging the stock right now.\nDeutsche Bank : $500 price target (+14%) — stays buy, leaning into the Robotaxi/AI narrative.\nBofA Securities : $471 price target (+8%) — raised target but kept a neutral stance, calling Tesla the “physical AI” leader while raising concerns over its valuation. Source: Investing.com\nGoldman Sachs : $420 price target (-4%) — nudged its target higher, but it’s still sitting below the tape.\nMorgan Stanley : $425 price target (-3%) — equal weight, with Robotaxi framed as the key catalyst for the first half of 2026. Source: Investing.com\nUBS : $247 price target (-44%) — sell, arguing the stock’s pricing in too much autonomy upside too soon. Source: Investing.com\n\nA choppy year put Tesla’s Q4 in context Tesla ’s 2025 delivery story has been anything but smooth.\nThe year 2025 began with a major stumble, as Tesla’s Q1 deliveries slid to 336,681 , primarily due to Model Y line changeovers, effectively sidelining production for weeks.\nQ2 brought improvement with 384,122 deliveries, but it still felt more like grinding progress than a real comeback.\n\nMore Tesla:\nTop-rated analyst drops curt 8-word take on Tesla stock\nTesla investors may miss game-changing move\nJudge orders Tesla to make major change or halt sales in California\nRivian doubles down on new plan to beat Tesla\nQ3 then changed the tone with deliveries surging to 497,099 , turning into Tesla’s best quarter of last year, driven mainly by customers rushing to access the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit before it expired.\nAdditionally, the competition only adds to the current context.\nChinese EV giant BYD yet again ended last year emphatically, selling 4.6 million vehicles , which includes nearly 2.26 million battery EVs , The Guardian reported, blowing past Tesla’s 1.64 million haul .\nMoreover, rivals including Geely , NIO , and Li Auto also posted impressive late-year numbers, highlighting the unforgiving nature of the EV landscape for Tesla.\nRelated: Analyst who nailed 2020 lows drops take on S&P 500\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 4, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Is Apple’s Valuation Still Justified After AI Push and Recent Share Price Drop?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 12:11 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nWondering if Apple still looks attractive at today's levels, or if most of the upside has already been realized? This breakdown will help you decide whether the current price really matches the story.\nDespite dipping around 0.9% over the last week and 2.8% over the past month, Apple is still up 11.9% over the last year and 112.2% over three years. This shows that long term holders have been well rewarded even as short term sentiment has wobbled.\nRecent headlines have focused on Apple's ongoing push into AI features across its devices and ecosystem, along with regulatory scrutiny around its App Store practices and broader tech competition. Together, these themes help explain why the market has been periodically reassessing both Apple's potential growth and its risk profile.\nRight now, Apple scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks , suggesting the stock only screens as undervalued on one of six measures. Next, we will unpack the popular valuation approaches investors rely on, and then finish with a more nuanced way to think about what Apple might really be worth.\n\nApple scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Apple Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future, then discounting those cash flows back to today in $ terms.\nFor Apple, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $99.9 billion. Analysts and the model expect this to rise steadily, with projected Free Cash Flow of around $184.1 billion by 2030. Near term projections are based on analyst estimates, while later years are extrapolated using Simply Wall St assumptions to create a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of roughly $223.60 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies Apple is about 21.2% overvalued on this metric. This suggests the market is paying a premium to the model’s cash flow based estimate.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Apple may be overvalued by 21.2%. Discover 875 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Apple.\nApproach 2: Apple Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Apple, the Price to Earnings ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are willing to pay today for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or greater uncertainty should translate into a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nStory Continues\nApple currently trades on a PE of about 35.8x. That is well above the broader Tech industry average of roughly 23.0x, and also a premium to its peer group, which sits around 33.0x. On the surface, that suggests investors are paying up for Apple relative to both its sector and close comparables.\nSimply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework estimates that, given Apple’s growth profile, profit margins, size and risk factors, a more appropriate PE would be closer to 37.7x. This Fair Ratio is more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it explicitly bakes in company specific fundamentals instead of assuming all tech stocks deserve the same multiple. Since Apple’s actual PE of 35.8x is slightly below this 37.7x Fair Ratio, the shares appear modestly undervalued on this metric.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1464 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Apple Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to attach your story about Apple to the numbers by setting your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins, and a fair value estimate. A Narrative connects three pieces together: the business story you believe, the financial forecast that flows from it, and the fair value that drops out at the end. On Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page used by millions of investors, where you can quickly choose or adjust a Narrative instead of rebuilding a model from scratch. Narratives can then help you decide whether to buy, hold, or sell by comparing your Fair Value to today’s share price, and they update dynamically as new earnings, news, or guidance arrive so your view does not go stale. For example, some Apple Narratives currently see fair value near $177, while others are closer to $287, reflecting how cautious and optimistic investors can look at the same company and still reach very different, but clearly quantified, conclusions.\n\nFor Apple however we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Apple Narratives:\n🐂 Apple Bull Case\nFair value: $275.00\nImplied undervaluation vs last close: approximately -2.9%\nRevenue growth assumption: 12.78%\nSees the recent near 35% share price drop as an overreaction to steep U.S. tariffs on China assembled iPhones, with Apple actively shifting production to India and Vietnam and pursuing exemptions.\nHighlights resilient fundamentals, including Q1 2025 profit of $36.33 billion that beat expectations and record $26.3 billion services revenue, alongside a \"Moderate Buy\" analyst consensus and a mean target of $251.72.\nArgues that AI investments, strong brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams position Apple for long term recovery and growth despite short term geopolitical and supply chain volatility.\n\n🐻 Apple Bear Case\nFair value: $177.34\nImplied overvaluation vs last close: approximately 52.9%\nRevenue growth assumption: 14.68%\nViews Apple as significantly overvalued, pointing to a P/E multiple well above the market given moderating growth and maturing product lines, especially the iPhone.\nFlags slowing hardware momentum, margin pressure from rising costs and lower priced products, and heavy dependence on China amid intensifying local competition and geopolitical risk.\nArgues that large cash reserves are not being deployed aggressively into transformative innovation, so the market's optimism and lofty valuation leave the stock vulnerable to a correction.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Apple?

      "Content": "在全球供應鏈重組與「美國製造」政策推動之下，台積電加速擴大美國布局，但是高昂的生產成本正對獲利能力形成明顯壓力。Wccftech網站引用SemiAnalysis資料指出，台積電在美國設廠後，單位晶圓毛利率與台灣相比出現巨大落差，主因在於人力成本與晶圓折舊費用大幅攀升。\n\n根據分析師彙整的數據，台積電台灣晶圓廠每片晶圓的人力成本約1,800美元，美國晶圓廠則高達3,600美元，整整高出1倍。在晶圓折舊方面差距更為驚人，台灣廠每片晶圓折舊費用約1,500美元，美國廠卻高達7,289美元，是台灣廠的4倍以上。受此影響，台灣晶圓廠單片晶圓毛利率約62％，美國晶圓廠僅約8％，幾乎只剩八分之一。\n\n所謂晶圓折舊，指的是晶圓廠建設與設備投資在使用年限內的成本攤提。由於美國晶圓廠產能規模與產能利用率相對較低，即便採用相同製程技術，單位產出的固定成本卻必須由更少的晶圓分攤，導致每片晶圓承擔更高的「固定費用」，進一步侵蝕毛利空間。\n\n此外，美國高昂的人力成本亦成為沉重負擔。為支撐美國晶圓廠運作，台積電必須要在聘用當地員工與從台灣派遣工程師之間做出取捨。無論採取何種方式，整體用人成本皆明顯高過於台灣，成為影響營運效率的重要因素。\n\n市場人士指出，這也是台積電亞利桑那州晶圓廠近期出現獲利下滑的主要原因。在建廠成本、營運費用與折舊壓力同步放大的情況下，美國生產晶片的經濟性仍有待時間與規模放大來改善。\n\n儘管短期毛利承壓，台積電推進美國布局的戰略意義依然明確。此舉有助於分散地緣政治風險，確保關鍵客戶在不同地區都能取得穩定產能，也獲得包括輝達在內的重要客戶支持。\n\n業界普遍認為，建立具韌性的美國半導體供應鏈是一項長期工程，台積電勢必在成本與戰略之間持續權衡，但美國擴產方向短期內不會改變。\n\n更多工商時報報導台股基金夯 19檔淨值破百元欣興董座：載板樂觀到2026養地怎麼認定？ 動工合理期間出爐",

      "Content": "4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points AI hyperscalers are ramping up their spending.\nThe stock is reasonably valued compared to its big tech peers.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the top stocks to own in 2025, marking the third straight year in which Nvidia outperformed the market. That's an impressive run, and I have no reason to doubt that Nvidia will continue that streak heading into 2026.\nEven after its 38% rise in 2025, I think Nvidia is still a top buy for 2026. I've got a handful of reasons why Nvidia is still a top buy now, and investors who don't have enough exposure to the top growth stock in the market should consider them as a reason to buy more.\n1. AI spending isn't slowing down After three years of artificial intelligence spending increasing, 2026 appears to be another year of growth. All the AI hyperscalers have informed investors that they should expect higher capital expenditures in 2026 than in 2025. Several companies benefit from these higher spending amounts, and Nvidia is one of them.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms told investors during its Q3 earnings announcement that its \"capital expenditures dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025.\" In 2024, Meta spent $39 billion on capital expenditures. For 2025, it expects full-year capital expenditures to be around $70 billion to $72 billion. If Meta continues this acceleration, it's reasonable to expect its AI spending to reach $100 billion by 2026.\nWhile Meta isn't spending all of that money on Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) , a decent chunk will be heading Nvidia's way. This same story can be repeated for practically any AI company, making Nvidia a strong candidate to own in 2026.\n2. 2026 isn't going to be the last year of AI growth This won't be the last year we see strong AI growth. Data centers take a considerable amount of time to build, and many of the plans announced in 2025 won't be fully operational for several years. This means that they won't be purchasing Nvidia chips for a few years, so the AI growth trend will stretch out beyond 2026. That's why Nvidia has informed investors that it expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.\n\nWith multiple years of AI growth expected, Nvidia is a great stock to buy and hold.\n3. Nvidia isn't as expensive as you may think There is a common misconception in the market that Nvidia's stock is overvalued. However, when you factor in the growth Nvidia is expected to deliver, this argument breaks down quickly. Nvidia trades for about 25 times fiscal year 2027's (ending January 2027) earnings.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's right in line with where other big tech companies trade, yet they don't have the great long-term prospects Nvidia does.\n4. Nvidia doesn't have the capacity to meet demand The massive AI demand for advanced chips has consumed all of Nvidia's production capacity. During its earnings call for the fiscal 2026 third quarter, Nvidia informed investors that it is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. When demand outpaces supply, that allows Nvidia to maintain its high margins and also control the supply of chips. Although alternatives are starting to emerge as real competition for Nvidia, it's still at the top of the AI food chain.\n\nNvidia is working as hard as it can to increase capacity to meet demand for its products, but just because you hear about an AI hyperscaler creating its own chips doesn't mean it's completely shifting away from Nvidia's technology.\nNvidia is still the top name in AI computing, and with AI spending expected to continue rising over the next few years, Nvidia is an excellent stock to buy hand over fist.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

      "Content": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 7:07 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has been down over the past few months.\nIt continues to have a dominant position in AI, and it's rolling out new products to keep it.\nNvidia is facing competition from a growing number of AI tech companies.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIs Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) finally slowing down? The artificial intelligence (AI) giant ended 2025 on a high note, up 39%. However, it's down about 7% from its highs at the end of October, when it became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap .\nCan it get back there? And does it still offer value for investors from this level? Let's see where it could be a year from now.\nNew products, rising competition Nvidia plays a central role in AI development. Its product line, including its various graphics processing units (GPU) and CUDA software, are relied upon by its many high-profile clients like Amazon and Microsoft .\nAI is a fast-moving and rapidly changing industry, and Nvidia continues to roll out innovative technology and new products to provide the necessary power for its clients to process data. Data centers are one of its biggest growth drivers today, and it keeps bringing out new graphics processing units (GPU) with more processing power to handle greater data loads. It's also rolling out many vertically integrated solutions that keep clients within its ecosystem. That protects it to some degree from the onslaught of new competition in the space. As a high-growth industry, there's no shortage of companies trying to develop more sophisticated AI technology.\n\nThat brings us to where Nvidia could be in a year. Considering its dominance and innovation, I don't envision it slowing down and losing ground just yet. So while new competition could eventually put a dent in its growth, it may take a while to make a big impact. At the same time, it looks like the market is already pricing in these worries into the stock's cost. As long as the AI market continues to grow, Nvidia is likely to follow suit, albeit at a slower pace than in the past.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Yes.\n00:02 Speaker B\nYou know, they they lost their way on on movies a long, long time ago. Their their television unit's actually quite good. Um the gaming unit has gone all in on on selling more consoles. And Microsoft by kind of pulling away from the console business, um gave Sony an opening to not cut price. So, you know, here we are, uh what, five full years into the launch of the PlayStation uh 5 and prices are higher than the launch price. Now, obviously, some of that is due to Trump, but, you know, tariffs. But um you this is just unprecedented that we haven't seen console prices decline. So Sony's selling a kind of a weak number of consoles, but they think they're winning because Microsoft's selling virtually none. Um I think the console business is going away. Um it'll it'll be a niche business like 3D televisions. There'll still be people who buy them like turntables for for listening to music. There are people who will buy them. But ultimately, we're going to get everything, you know, on connected TV and Sony is just not part of that. Their acquisition strategy has been downright stupid. Uh they bought Bungie for $3.6 billion dollars. You know, and just to compare and contrast that EA bought uh Vince Zampella, the late Vince Zampella's Titanfall maker respawn for 450 million. So Sony is just ridiculously overpaying for things. Uh Bungie's produced nothing that has worked. Uh the console business is dying and they don't have a backup plan.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "With 81% ownership in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:SIMO), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 6:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nKey Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Silicon Motion Technology's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nThe top 18 shareholders own 51% of the company\nOwnership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nEvery investor in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation ( NASDAQ:SIMO ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nLast week’s 3.9% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 75% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Silicon Motion Technology, beginning with the chart below.\nView our latest analysis for Silicon Motion Technology\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Silicon Motion Technology? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Silicon Motion Technology. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Silicon Motion Technology's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Silicon Motion Technology. FMR LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 10.0% of shares outstanding. Reinhart Partners, LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 4.4% of common stock, and Acadian Asset Management LLC holds about 3.8% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Chia-Chang Kou, the CEO has 1.4% of the shares allocated to their name.\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of Silicon Motion Technology The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Silicon Motion Technology Corporation. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$100m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Silicon Motion Technology. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nNext Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

      "Content": "Tesla Stock Has Been Flat For 2 Months - How to Make a 3.2% Yield in One-Month Puts\n\nMark R. Hake, CFA\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 6:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nTesla, Inc. ( TSLA ) stock has been flat over the last 2 months. But investors are making money by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options. For example, over the next month, Tesla put options with exercise prices 6.4% lower than today's price provide a 3.2% income yield.\nTSLA closed at $438.07 on Friday, Jan. 2, 2026. That is about where it was on Nov. 6, 2025, when it closed at $445.91. However, some investors have made money by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options (and OTM calls).\n\nMore News from Barchart The Saturday Spread: How Basketball Analytics May Help Extract Alpha (CPNG, DBX, BBY)\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nMaking Money with Out-of-the-Money Xash-Secured Put Sales For example, I discussed this in a Dec. 2, 2025, Barchart article, “ Tesla Stock Has Been Flat - Good for Shorting Puts to Make a One-Month 2.5% Yield .”\nI demonstrated how an investor could earn $1,068 on December 2, 2026, by securing $40,500 in collateral with their brokerage firm for a put that expired on January 2, 2026.\n\nThat was a cash-secured short-put play for investors, giving them an immediate 2.637% one-month yield (i.e., $10.68/$405.00). In return, the investors had an obligation to buy 100 shares with the collateral at $405.00, if TSLA stock fell by 5.6% to that price on or before Jan. 2, 2026.\nSince TSLA closed at $438.07, this obligation expired, and the investors made a clean 2.64% one-month yield. (By the way, TSLA rose from $430.46 to $438.07 over the last month, or just +1.77% - so shorting OTM puts was a better play).\nTherefore, it now makes sense to repeat this short put play.\nShorting TSLA Puts Over the Next Month For example, look at the Feb. 6, 2026, expiration TSLA put option chain. It shows that the $410 exercise price put option contract has a midpoint premium of $13.23.\nAn investor can earn an immediate yield of 3.226% (i.e., $13.23/$410.00) for an obligation to buy 100 shares at $410, i.e., 6.4% below Friday's close.\nIn other words, by securing $41,000 with their brokerage firm, the investor who enters an order to “Sell to Open” 1 put contract at $410 expiring Feb. 6, immediately collects $1,323.00 .\nMoreover, even if TSLA falls to $410 on or before Feb. 6, 2026, the investor's net cost, i.e., the breakeven (B/E) point, is below $400 per share:\n$410.00 - $13.23 income received = $396.77 B/E\nIn other words, this is a good way to set a potential lower buy-in point. That B/E is $41.30 below Friday's close at $438.07 , or a downside protection of 9.4%\n\nStory Continues\nThat seems like a good way for existing investors to make extra income, plus potentially lower their average cost in TSLA stock.\nFor new investors, it also sets a lower buy-in point but provides income while waiting.\nRisks and How to Handle Them Nevertheless, it could result in an unrealized loss if TSLA falls below $410 and the puts are assigned to buy 100 shares with the cash-secured collateral. For example, if TSLA falls to $396.00, the investor would have a net unrealized loss, as it would be below the B/E point.\nHowever, all would not be lost. Don't forget that by doing successive one-month short-put plays, the investor builds up income. For example, over the last two months, an investor would have gained $1,068 + $1,323, or $2,391, or $23.91 per put contract shorted.\n\nThat means that the net breakeven is now $410-$23.91, or $386.09. That's 11.9% below today's price.\nMoreover, even after having an assignment, the investor now owns 100 shares of TSLA. They have not sold anything. That means they could sell out-of-the-money (OTM) covered calls over the next month. This would help defray any potential unrealized loss - again without selling any TSLA shares.\nThe bottom line is that if TSLA stock stays flat over the next several months, it makes sense to take advantage of the high put option premiums.\nShorting one or two-month out-of-the-money put options provides good income and a potentially lower buy-in point.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Buy in January That Could Join Nvidia in the $1 Trillion Club by 2030\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, January 4, 2026 at 5:29 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nORCL\n\nV\n\nXOM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Visa and ExxonMobil are highly efficient businesses that return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nOracle is a high-risk, high-potential-reward bet on increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nNetflix deserves a premium valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Visa ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ended 2025 as the most valuable company in the world. It is one of nine S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stocks with market capitalizations exceeding $1 trillion -- the others being Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Broadcom , Tesla , and Berkshire Hathaway .\nEli Lilly , Walmart , and JPMorgan Chase only need to rise 14% or less to expand the list to 12 companies.\nHere's why Visa (NYSE: V) , ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) , and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) have what it takes to be winning investments over the next five years and join the $1 trillion club by 2030.\n1. Visa Visa's path to $1 trillion is fairly straightforward. The payment processor has high margins, a reasonable valuation , and steady earnings growth, and returns tons of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nVisa can generate high single-digit or double-digit earnings growth even during challenging periods.\nDespite slowdowns in consumer spending, Visa grew non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) earnings per share by 14% in 2025. If Visa can maintain that growth rate going forward, it could reach a market cap well beyond $1 trillion by 2030.\n\n2. ExxonMobil ExxonMobil will need to double in five years to surpass $1 trillion in market cap. It absolutely has what it takes.\nExxonMobil is generating gobs of free cash flow (FCF) and high earnings, even though oil prices are hovering around four-year lows. It has reduced its production costs and can break even at low oil prices, and has plenty of upside potential during a higher-price environment. It also has a growing low-carbon business and a massive refining and marketing segment.\n\nExxonMobil's corporate plan through 2030 forecasts double-digit earnings growth even if oil and gas prices are mediocre. Although the U.S. Energy Information Administration is only forecasting $55 per Brent crude oil barrel in 2026, oil prices could rise in the coming years due to economic demand fueled by artificial intelligence (AI), as well as overall economic growth and geopolitical tensions.\nEither way, ExxonMobil doesn't need a lot of help from oil prices to grow earnings at a solid pace. A 15% annual growth rate, compounded over five years, would double earnings. Given the stock's reasonable volatility, it could double as well, pole-vaulting ExxonMobil over the $1 trillion bar.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the meantime, ExxonMobil investors will benefit from its stable and growing 3.4% dividend, which ExxonMobil has increased for 43 consecutive years.\n3. Oracle Oracle almost surpassed $1 trillion in market cap in September before falling over 40% from that high due to concerns about its AI spending and mounting debt.\nOracle is ramping up spending to build out data center infrastructure to grow its cloud computing market share, especially for high-performance computing workflows. It exited its most recent quarter with $523 billion in remaining performance obligations, signaling demand is high for its infrastructure. But Oracle needs to convert capital expenditures into earnings. In the meantime, it is FCF negative, making Oracle a leveraged bet on increased AI adoption.\n\nDespite its risks, Oracle's potential is impossible to ignore. Oracle is a great buy for investors who agree that its aggressive AI investments are the right long-term move and are willing to endure what will likely be a highly volatile period in the stock price.\n4. Netflix Over the last six months, Netflix's market cap has slipped from over $560 billion to under $400 billion due to a mix of valuation concerns and uncertainties regarding its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) . Netflix will probably receive regulatory approval for the acquisition, but still faces challenges from Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ: PSKY) , which is attempting a hostile takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nBut with or without Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix has what it takes to steadily grow earnings through a combination of global subscriber growth and pricing power. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, it could create a highly lucrative top-tier streaming platform that features content from both Netflix and HBO, as well as a revamped ad-supported tier.\nEven without HBO, Netflix has mastered the art of aligning content spending with steady subscription revenues, thanks to its depth and breadth of content -- from building global franchises from scratch like Stranger Things , to the success of KPop Demon Hunters.\nNetflix has already demonstrated impeccable pricing power with multiple price increases in a relatively short amount of time and a crackdown on password sharing that was largely accepted by users -- even during a period when people are pulling back on discretionary spending. So even if it doesn't quite crack the $1 trillion club, I still fully expect Netflix to be a winning investment and outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years.\n\nStart the new year off right with these top stocks With the broader indexes around all-time highs, it's easy to get enamored by the companies that could surge in value in the coming months or in 2026. But a far more rewarding approach is to invest in companies that have what it takes to compound in value over the long term.\nVisa, ExxonMobil, Oracle, and Netflix certainly fit that mold. That's why I expect all four stocks to outperform the S&P 500 and join the $1 trillion club over the next five years, even though they are currently far from reaching that milestone.\n\nShould you buy stock in Visa right now? Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

I wrote a story yesterday on Yahoo Finance saying laying out why the stock could rise 50% next year. I got a lot of uh, let's say negative feedback on that. Very important, I wasn't making this call. I was just laying out the reasons why it could happen. Am I out of my mind here?\n00:22 Speaker B\nWelcome to the investment business.\n00:25 Speaker B\nUm no, I saw it and I do agree. I think there are a number it it's been a laggard. Uh they delivered robust earnings. I mean, really a massive earnings beat last quarter. Um the AWS business is very mature but still growing at 20%. and they and they offered this tidbit that I didn't see many people talk about and that is that October growth in that business was bigger than the whole third quarter. So, I I wouldn't underestimate them. Traium is at full capacity and uh has a backlog and it's a stock that's trading at a peg of 1.4 times. If you go back and look at the S&P historically, it's traded at a peg of 1.5 to two times. Um so I think this company is fairly valued um and has the ability to deliver not just robust earnings growth, but free cash flow is going to increase next year to levels we haven't seen in five years.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】台股新年報喜，加權指數2日帶頭創高，衝過29,000點整數關卡之上，美科技股同步繳出亮眼成績。法人看好即將登場的CES展、台積電15日法說，以及月底Fed利率決策會議最新動向，成為「多頭三把火」，可望帶動買盤持續回補，點亮台股元月行情。\n\n萬寶投顧總監蔡明彰表示，台股1月將關注三大事。第一是美國CES展，輝達、AMD等AI股表現為關注重點。其次，台積電法說預計將釋出去年第四季強勁財報，而29日為Fed今年首次利率決策會議，雖受經濟數據影響，降息機率降低，但美股2025歲末已提前反應，市場預期在川普影響下，Fed可能採取更為激進的降息步調，對資金動能有所挹注。\n\n富邦投顧分析，CES 2026展於6至9日舉辦，輝達與AMD都將發表專題演講。CES雖然是以消費電子為主的展覽，今年主軸可說是「AI Everywhere」，未來AI不再只是雲端上的大模型，而是直接內建於PC、手機、汽車、家電中，具身智慧（Embodied AI）讓機器人能感知物理世界並進行互動，也是本屆最大亮點，預料將帶給投資市場對於AI未來發展更大的想像空間。\n\n整體來看，預期AI發展由基礎建設轉向全面商用，台灣半導體、PCB、散熱及組裝廠實質受惠，AI Agent驅動企業端與消費端換機潮，台股在AI產業競爭力強，預料將是國際資金配置亞太市場首選，支撐台股向上。\n\n台積電法說前夕「未演先轟動」，市值已登上全球第六大。群益投顧研究部副總裁曾炎裕認為，15日法說重點關注台積電資本支出將挑戰新高，市場共識是420億～450億美元，部分法人喊上500億美元，主因是N2量產進度優於預期及AI需求。\n\n此外，A16製程預計2026年下半年進入量產導入超級電軌（Super Power Rail）技術，需大量採購新一代曝光機與晶圓處理設備，台積電擴充CoWoS、SoIC能支應輝達及CSP的AI晶片需求，有望帶動周邊供應鏈業績。\n\n不過，蔡明彰也提醒，就技術面觀察，大盤月線K值已來到94％高檔位置，對比2025年年初也曾出現同樣情況，而後就遇到DeekSeek橫空出世及川普對等關稅兩大利空衝擊，今年仍需提防首季出現修正可能。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一陳昱光／台北報導)",

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】上周五是2026年的第一個交易日，台股大盤不負眾望，直接跨越29,000點大關，這種氣勢如虹的表現，不僅宣示多頭架構的延續，更為今年的台股行情定下了「強者恆強」的基調。統一投顧分析師陳立委新一周選入旺宏（2337）、益登（3048）、光頡（3624）、欣興（3037）、惠特（6706）。\n\n受惠台積電法說會前樂觀氛圍及產業重磅利多加持，上周五加權指數以29,016點紅盤開出，隨後買盤源源不絕，指數開高走高，盤中幾乎沒有太大回檔壓力，終場大漲386點，收在29,349點，漲幅達1.33％，再度刷新歷史新高紀錄。成交量能配合擴大至6,488億元之上，顯示這波攻勢並非虛火，而是有實質買盤進場承接。\n\n推動大盤再創高峰的動力，主要來自半導體與AI產業鏈強力利多。市場傳出中國為加速AI布局，擬在2026年向輝達採購超過200萬顆H200晶片，這項消息含金量極高。與此同時，美國向台積電核發出口許可，准許其將美國晶片製造設備出口至中國，這讓半導體設備族群吃下定心丸。\n\n全球矚目的CES消費電子展即將在1/6登場，AI PC、AI眼鏡以及各類邊緣運算應用將是展場焦點；此外，光學鏡頭龍頭大立光將於8日召開法說會，護國神山台積電則在15日接棒。市場預期在先進製程產能滿載及CoWoS擴產順利的背景下，法說會將釋出正向展望。\n\n從技術面來看，上周五這根實體大紅K棒具有指標性意義。指數目前穩穩站在所有均線之上，呈現標準的多頭排列。KD指標與RSI指標同步向上，顯示短線動能強勁；MACD紅柱體持續放大，代表多方力道正在加速集結。在技術面毫無敗象的情況下，拉回找買點仍是目前最順勢的操作邏輯。\n\n中國亦傳出開發出名為 LightGen的光子晶片，試圖在運算效能上挑戰輝達，這顯示美中科技戰將進入新一輪技術軍備競賽，長線可能對現有供應鏈版圖產生微妙變化。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一陳昱光／台北報導)",

      "Content": "Is This a Rare Buying Opportunity for Amazon Stock?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 10:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon has multiple high-growth business segments, despite low stock returns in 2025.\nThis mismatch presents a buying opportunity, especially as Amazon continues to harness artificial intelligence.\nAmazon's online ads are boosting margins while catching up to Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a reliable long-term performer, but the growth stock didn't have a spectacular 2025. The growth stock only gained 5% despite strong financial results throughout the year, and this mismatch makes Amazon look promising.\nIt has made great strides in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), four industries that are poised for long-term growth. That's enough to warrant a closer look, and when you dig into recent results, Amazon's stock seems undervalued at current levels.\nOnline ads can boost margins Amazon's margins have received a massive boost in recent years as its business diversifies beyond online retail. While Amazon Web Services has taken center stage in the company's long-term plans, investors should also consider the growth in Amazon's online advertising segment.\nThat part of the business was up by 24% year over year in Q3, reaching $17.7 billion. Although ad revenue is a little less than 10% of Amazon's total revenue, it is a high-margin business. Amazon is also competing with tech giants Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) with online ads. Meta Platforms earned $51.2 billion in Q3, while Alphabet brought in $65.9 billion from ads.\n\nAmazon's ad business is catching up to the two adtech leaders. It's still growing at a great pace despite the one-year stock gains not reflecting that.\nArtificial intelligence enables multiple tailwinds While some AI stocks are speculative, Amazon is already making money with this technology. Amazon Web Services revenue growth has accelerated and achieved a 20% year-over-year growth rate, returning to 2022 growth levels, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\nArtificial intelligence requires more cloud computing, and that has resulted in more companies turning to Amazon Web Services. Amazon's cloud platform also lets businesses build AI agents.\n\nAmazon is also using internal Trainium2 chips to power parts of its cloud platform. Trainium2 AI chips can reduce Amazon's chip costs, making it easier for the company to expand its AI presence. These same AI chips are generating strong demand and can become another valuable segment under Amazon's corporate umbrella. For instance, Trainium2 AI chips grew by 150% sequentially and are now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is also using AI to enhance its offerings, such as its online marketplace. AI lets Amazon present personalized product recommendations and display ads that are more likely to get clicks.\nThe tech giant's stock price movements over the past year do not reflect the quality of the business. Amazon's overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year in Q3, while net income rose by 38% year-over-year. Both of those rates are higher than the stock's one-year return, which may set the stage for a 2026 rally.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $490,703 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,157,689 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 966 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 194% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】2026年初，全球科技股將迎來兩個高度關鍵事件：美國拉斯維加斯的CES消費電子展，以及台積電1月法人說明會。前者代表終端需求與應用場景的最新風向，後者則是半導體供給端與資本支出循環的核心指標。在AI投資主軸仍然清晰的背景下，這兩項事件有望協助市場從短期題材修正回到基本面，並引導資金重新聚焦在具備結構性成長與出貨能見度的受惠族群。\n\n從CES展的角度來看，2026年的最大特色在於市場不再單純為「AI 能做什麼」買單，而是開始檢驗「AI是否真的能被穩定使用」。無論是智慧家居、穿戴裝置或機器人，展會訊息顯示，廠商正試圖以續航時間、即時反應與隱私保護等實際體驗，說服消費者與企業端加快採用。對投資人而言，CES的價值不在於單一明星產品，而在於平台化與生態系是否成形，以及量產與上市時程是否同步揭露。\n\n值得注意的是，本屆CES的另一條隱性主線，落在「端側AI的基礎建設」。隨著AI功能逐步下放至終端設備，對高效率電源管理、感測器融合、記憶體頻寬與高速介面的需求同步上升。這類需求雖不如終端產品吸睛，卻直接影響整體使用體驗與成本結構。若展後能看到OEM與平台商在規格與供應鏈選擇上趨於一致，將有助於相關零組件供應商取得較長期的訂單能見度，也更容易被資本市場視為「可投資的成長題材」。\n\n機器人與Physical AI仍是CES最具想像空間的板塊，但同時也是市場最謹慎看待的領域。投資焦點已從舞台展示轉向實際任務的穩健度與商業可行性，尤其是在非受控環境下的安全性與長期維護成本。若主流平台能在展期或展後釋出清楚的SDK、生態夥伴與應用案例，相關的致動器、視覺感測、邊緣運算與工業電腦供應鏈，才有機會從題材性評價，轉為基本面驅動。\n\n然而，CES所釋出的需求訊號，最終仍需上游供應鏈的產能與技術配合，這也使得台積電1月法說成為市場更關鍵的定錨點。2026年初法說會的重心，將不只是單季營運表現，而是資本支出規模、先進製程擴產節奏，以及先進封裝是否持續放量。\n\n隨著AI應用由雲端延伸至邊緣，晶片設計對能效與異質整合的依賴程度提高，台積電在2nm製程與CoWoS、SoIC等封裝技術上的布局，直接影響整條供應鏈的投資信心。\n\n市場普遍預期，2026年台積電資本支出將由2025年的400～420億美元提高至500億美元，重點放在3nm擴產、2nm量產爬坡以及先進封裝產能擴張。\n\n由於CoWoS仍是AI晶片的關鍵瓶頸，任何關於產能提升、良率改善與交期穩定的說法，都可能成為資金重新布局封裝測試與材料族群的重要催化劑。即便海外新廠與新節點初期可能壓抑短期毛利，但只要定價能力與長期毛利率目標維持不變，市場對先進製程的估值邏輯仍將站得住腳。整體而言，CES與台積電法說形成了需求端與供給端的雙重驗證。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一凱基投顧董事長朱晏民)",

      "Content": "【時報記者張佳琪台北報導】台股2026年第一個交易日成績亮眼，指數盤中刷新歷史新高紀錄至29363點，終場收在29349點，大漲386點，漲幅1.33%。累計單週強漲793點，週線連2紅，漲幅達2.78%，平均日均量5388.51億元。隨著CES展即將登場，且台積電法說會在即，投信對於元月行情抱持樂觀。\n\n台股2025年封關日的強勢行情延續至2026年紅盤日，大盤新年度開門喜，法人也同步買超。統計顯示，外資與自營商連袂買超台股，外資單週回補254.81億元，連續兩週站在買方；自營商買超169.02億元，已連續六週回補台股。僅投信法人連續兩週調節124.8億元。合計三大法人單週共買超台股299.04億元。\n\n保德信市值動能50 ETF(009803)經理人楊立楷展望台股2026年，認為有望續創新高。他說明，主要受惠AI需求有增無減，盤點於全球對台灣出口產品的需求持續強勁，尤其是涵蓋AI、半導體與電子零組件相關領域的電子產品、資訊通信年增率相對突出，也推升台灣企業產能，預估2026年台股企業獲利將延續雙位數高速成長。\n\n楊立楷表示，國際AI巨頭紛紛擴張資本支出並簽署合作協議，預期相關乘數效應將推動應用層面百花齊放，對於台廠AI供應鏈不啻為重大利多。而根據歷史數據，台股走勢與企業獲利呈現高度正向關聯，獲利增長往往伴隨指數上行，未來行情更值得期待。\n\n針對未來一週台股脈動，楊立楷表示，首先關注將於6日至9日在拉斯維加斯舉行的CES展，根據主辦單位預估，本次吸引約13萬名與會者、4500家廠商參展，且隨著AI持續發展，本屆CES以「AI Forward」為主題，反映出AI已不只停留在概念驗證階段，而是正式走向新的應用面與商業化階段。他說，本次CES展主題可預期人工智慧、智慧家居、綠色科技及車用技術將為焦點，並釋出AI落地與新應用的最新趨勢，而這些需求面將直接影響封裝、PCB、光通訊與記憶體等產業的拉貨節奏，進而激勵台廠供應鏈股價的表現空間。\n\n再者，光學龍頭大廠大立光於8日舉行法說會，晶圓龍頭大廠台積電法說會也將於15日舉辦。楊立楷提醒，兩大廠釋出的展望預料將牽動市場投資情緒。\n\n整體而言，楊立楷認為，從目前至1月上半月，美台股市通常呈現易漲難跌走勢，且時序進入1月，外資可望於假期結束全面回流，配合美股維持強勢及企業展望正向，台股有望再度放量推升，元月行情值得期待。",

      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Loaded Up on Nike Stock. Should You?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 12:38 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tim Cook bought 50,000 shares of Nike stock.\nThe Apple CEO is a director on Nike's board.\nNike recently returned to top-line growth, but there are still some major concerns.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nWhen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE) in late December, it got a lot of attention and even sent shares of the athletic apparel and shoe company sharply higher. After all, not only is Cook a successful businessman, but he is a Nike insider. The CEO sits on Nike's board of directors.\nInvestors sometimes treat insider buying as a simple signal: management (or board members) think the stock is undervalued. Sometimes that's right. But investors shouldn't follow blindly.\nSo, is Nike stock a good buy today or not? Let's take a look.\nCook's buy matters, but so does the context Notably, Cook's purchase was an open market one. This means it wasn't part of a stock option compensation plan (or a similar plan). Rather, he had to pay full price for his shares. Additionally, the purchase was sizable, totaling nearly $3 million. It also nearly doubled his stake in the company. Given the size of the purchase and the significant increase in Cook's stake, it's not surprising that the market interpreted the purchase as good news.\n\nStill, it's important to remember that Cook is a Nike director.\nThat doesn't mean the purchase is meaningless. But it does mean he may have incentives beyond pure return maximization. Directors often want to demonstrate alignment with shareholders, reinforce confidence during a rough stretch, or meet (or stay ahead of) internal ownership expectations. In other words, it can be both a sincere vote of confidence and a governance-minded move.\nA rough patch Investors should look beyond Cook's purchase to answer this simple question: Does Nike's business momentum (or lack of it) and valuation offer an attractive risk-reward right now?\nUnfortunately, I don't think so.\nNike's turnaround is making progress, but the business still looks challenged.\n\nRevenue in the company's second quarter of fiscal 2026 (a period ended on Nov. 30, 2025), rose just 1% year over year. Further, the composition of this revenue was probably even more discouraging than this anemic headline figure. Yes, wholesale revenue rose 8% year over year, but its higher-margin Nike Direct revenue fell 8%. Nike Direct is the company's direct-to-consumer channel, made up of Nike-owned stores and sales through its digital platforms. So, this channel speaks to the company's brand power with consumers, given how directly these channels are tied to its business and to consumers.\n\nStory Continues\nNike's profitability also moved in the wrong direction. Gross margin fell 300 basis points to 40.6%, and net income declined 32% to $792 million.\nSome of Nike's near-term problems are self-inflicted as it tries to reposition parts of its business and sharpen its product and brand message so that it can perform better over the long term. But Nike still has a lot of work to do.\n\n\"NIKE is in the middle innings of our comeback,\" said Nike CEO Elliott Hill in the company's latest earnings release, adding that the company is working through its \"Win Now\" strategic actions, including \"strengthening partner relationships\" and \"rebalancing our portfolio...\"\nMeanwhile, the athleisure space remains intensely competitive , as the company faces major competition from younger brands like Lululemon , Vuori, and Hoka, as well as more established brands like Adidas . Of course, Nike's brand still has enormous global equity. But consumers have more choices than ever.\nA look at valuation I'd be more willing to recommend Nike in the middle of its turnaround and an intensely competitive environment, but shares arguably don't look cheap enough. Sure, the company's dividend yield of 2.6% is solid, and Nike has an exceptional balance sheet. But with earnings moving in the wrong direction and sales barely growing, it's tough to justify the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 37.\n\nEven Nike's forward price-to-earnings is high, at 40. Measuring its price as a multiple of analysts' expected earnings per share over the next year, the fact that Nike's forward price-to-earnings ratio is higher than its trailing price-to-earnings ratio shows that analysts expect earnings to remain under pressure.\nGiven the competitive intensity in athleisure, declining sales in its direct-to-consumer channel, margin pressure, and ongoing uncertainty as far as tariffs go, I personally will be staying on the sidelines.\nCook's buy in Nike stock is interesting. But, for me, that's about all it is.\nShould you buy stock in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Should You Think About Buying Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Now?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 5:46 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. ( NASDAQ:SWKS ), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$80.66 and falling to the lows of US$60.50. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Skyworks Solutions' current trading price of US$64.40 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Skyworks Solutions’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhat Is Skyworks Solutions Worth? The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Skyworks Solutions today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $78.52, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Skyworks Solutions’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nWhat kind of growth will Skyworks Solutions generate? Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Skyworks Solutions' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? SWKS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nStory Continues\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SWKS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Skyworks Solutions , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\nIf you are no longer interested in Skyworks Solutions, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Marvell Technology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRVL) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nWith its stock down 9.0% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study Marvell Technology's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marvell Technology is:\n18% = US$2.5b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2025).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Marvell Technology\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nMarvell Technology's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE To start with, Marvell Technology's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Marvell Technology's net income shrunk at a rate of 6.6% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\nThat being said, we compared Marvell Technology's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 5.0% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MRVL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory Continues\nIs Marvell Technology Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? When we piece together Marvell Technology's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 8.4% (where it is retaining 92% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nIn addition, Marvell Technology has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 3.9% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.\nConclusion In total, it does look like Marvell Technology has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia has purchased Intel shares worth $5 billion, carrying out a transaction ‌announced in September.\nThe AI chipmaker had announced back then that it would pay $23.28 per share for Intel ⁠common stock, buying over 214.7 million Intel shares at the price set out in the agreement, as per Monday's filing. The deal forms part of a broader strategic agreement to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers.\nThe share purchase comes just a week after Reuters reported that Nvidia Corp. has halted a test to use Intel’s advanced 18A manufacturing process to make advanced chips. The AI chipmaker tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, the report said.\nInvestors had been closely watching Intel's advanced 18A as a milestone that could help the company compete more directly with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in advanced chip manufacturing. However, the halt now raises concerns about the company’s ability to regain ground in the foundry race.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures, and sells computer products and technologies, delivering data storage, computer, networking, and communications platforms.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) share price has soared 109% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock!\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring three years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 28% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Apple will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 112% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective Apple shareholders are up 12% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 16% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Apple you should know about.\n\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

Analyst sentiment has followed that move. Jefferies upgraded the shares to Buy and lifted its price target to $1,500. Oppenheimer kept an Outperform rating and set a $1,400 target. Those calls helped reinforce momentum and pushed investor confidence higher.\n\nThe broader backdrop has also helped. SEMI expects semiconductor equipment sales to hit a record in 2025, driven largely by AI-related investment. Those macro tailwinds fueled a rally across the sector, lifting many equipment names at the same time.\nEarlier in October, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates. Management pointed to strong AI-linked demand for its chipmaking tools, while also calling out growing risks tied to its China exposure amid ongoing US–China trade tensions.\nDemand for advanced chips that support generative AI workloads has continued to climb. That trend benefits niche suppliers like KLA, whose equipment is used inside semiconductor manufacturing facilities, commonly known as fabs.\n\nTrade policy remains a clear headwind. KLA expects US export restrictions to reduce sales by $300M to $350M over the next five quarters. The company said this reflects “additional market access loss related to certain customers in China resulting from extended export controls from the U.S. government,” according to a letter to shareholders.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is based in Milpitas, California. The company designs wafer fab equipment and supplies process control and yield management systems used across the semiconductor industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Moreover, AMD will be looking to build a platform, not just offer alternatives.\nCES 2025 recap: what Nvidia and AMD showed last year That said, here’s the lowdown from last year’s event for both tech giants.\nNvidia showed off its powerful Cosmos platform for “physical AI,” positioning it as a foundation for real-world deployment.\nNvidia introduced Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs while highlighting new RTX-PC AI tooling (including NIM microservices/Blueprints).\nAMD rolled out its AI PC portfolio, covering Ryzen AI Max/Max PRO , and expanded Ryzen AI 300 chips tailored to Copilot+ PCs.\nAMD leaned into gaming/graphics with Ryzen X3D desktop chips and Ryzen Z2 handheld processors. Also, it offered previews of the Radeon RX 9070- series (RDNA 4) GPUs and FSR 4.\n\nStory Continues\nAt CES 2026, the real fight is over AI CES 2026 runs January 6 to 9 in Las Vegas , and though it has historically been more of a gadget showcase, this year it’s shaping up to be the year’s first high-stakes tech meeting.\nInvestors expect a needle-moving event, spearheaded by concrete roadmaps, partnerships, and major commitments.\nFor the biggest chipmakers, CES will be all about owning the AI conversation early . Nvidia will seek to reinforce its dominance by rallying partners with demos, keynotes, and industry-wide signaling.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood shells out $1.3 million on biotech stock\nAMD will look to rain on Nvidia’s parade.\nBy spotlighting new PC platforms and capitalizing on a larger OEM market share , AMD will aim to carve out its own lane for AI-driven growth.\nFor perspective, the AI trade has lost its luster lately, and big-name skepticism targets are growing louder.\nFront and center is the “Big Short” Michael Burry , who is openly comparing the current AI frenzy to past manias.\nBurry delivered a scathing takedown of Nvidia.\nThat’s exactly why Nvidia and AMD will be looking for a strong start to set the tone early in 2026.\nBig banks reset targets on Nvidia and AMD Nvidia and AMD both had a solid outing at the stock market last year.\nFor perspective, Nvidia stock ended 2025 up 41% , while AMD posted an 83% gain .\nNow, Wall Street is recalibrating its expectations for 2026, with investors in “show-me” mode when it comes to AI.\nBank of America : Nvidia buy, $275 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nMorgan Stanley : Nvidia overweight, $250 price target; AMD equal weight, $260 price target\nUBS : Nvidia buy, $235 price target; AMD buy, $300 price target\nGoldman Sachs : Nvidia buy , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $210 price target\nSource: Investing.com\nJPMorgan : Nvidia overweight , $250 price target; AMD neutral, $270 price target\nSource: Barron's\nRelated: Veteran analyst resets AI stock buy list for 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 2, 2026, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

Cisco Systems, Inc. is placed seventh among the best long-term investments .\nTheFly reported on December 22 that shares of CSCO declined 26 cents to $78.16, reflecting mixed sentiment in the options market. Options volume was roughly in line with the average, with 51,000 contracts traded and calls outpacing puts, resulting in a put/call ratio of 0.77, above the typical level of 0.64.\n\nImplied volatility (IV30) fell 1.28 points to 18.8, placing it in the bottom quartile of the past year and indicating an expected daily move of $0.93. Meanwhile, the flattened put-call skew suggested a modestly bullish tone, pointing to cautious optimism among options traders despite the slight drop in shares.\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nSeparately, on December 17, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) received a boost when Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall maintained an Overweight rating and raised the price target from $82 to $91. In the research note, Marshall highlighted CSCO’s strong performance in AI-related growth drivers, noting that the company had surpassed $1 billion in AI-related orders, reaching $1.3 billion from hyperscale customers. This momentum suggests that AI-driven revenue could contribute around 5% of CSCO’s total business by fiscal year 2026, up from approximately 2% currently.\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) designs and sells a broad range of technologies across networking, security, collaboration, and applications. The company is currently leveraging its acquisition of Splunk to enhance its recurring software revenue and observability capabilities.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

They're hosting their own press event on January 5th. CEO Jensen Wong will take the stage. He did it last year as well. They announced a number of new products, a new chip for a smaller bitesize desktop AI computer, as well as a number of different software innovations that they've really been pushing as of late.

I mean, you know, the chips themselves are are, you know, obviously enough to say that AI is going to dominate, but uh you can expect to see a lot of robots, uh a lot of smart home devices. You can even see some wearables that are AI powered. And those usually, you know, so far we haven't seen anything too interesting as far as AI powered wearables outside of maybe, you know, the intelligence built into smart glasses or smart watches. There's never been a dedicated device that's really taken off. Open AI is supposedly working on one, don't expect it at CES. Uh and then finally, uh Autos.

Uh we know that there'll be some major automakers like Hyundai on hand, uh Sony and Honda, their uh Afeela vehicle will be there as well. Uh and so it's going to be a jam-packed show, but again, I think the big takeaway is going to be from Nvidia.

Shares of networking chips designer Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 4.9% in the afternoon session after positive reports highlighted strong momentum in its AI-focused custom chip business and optimistic growth projections for the year ahead.\nThe company’s AI XPU offerings experienced significant traction, which led to a 37.8% year-over-year increase in its data center segment revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. This growth was driven by its custom silicon products. Looking forward, analysts projected a “snap-back” year for Marvell, with expectations for revenue to surge by approximately 40% in fiscal 2026. This anticipated growth was fueled by both the recovery of its carrier and enterprise segments and the high-volume production of custom AI silicon, as previous inventory issues were largely resolved.\n\nIs now the time to buy Marvell Technology? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Marvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% on the news that investment firm Citi issued a positive catalyst watch for the stock ahead of the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES), contributing to a broader rally in the chip sector. Citi noted that worries about competition from two major clients were likely unfounded and viewed the stock's recent price drop as a buying opportunity. The firm anticipated Marvell would showcase wider use of its networking solutions at the conference. Adding to the positive sentiment, analysts at Benchmark clarified that Marvell had retained its role in Amazon's Trainium chip designs, easing recent investor concerns. The stock's move also came amid general strength in the semiconductor market, as other chipmakers like Micron and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index also posted gains.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,931.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

      "Content": "Is Broadcom Stock a Buy After the Dip?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:43 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Some investors are feeling skittish about the high levels of capital spending on AI.\nOne important player, Broadcom, has a big opportunity in custom chip production.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nSemiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the big winners in the recent generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom that started with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. Shares have soared by roughly 350% in three years as investors bet on its ability to capitalize on the soaring demand for advanced computing hardware.\n\nThat said, some market participants feel that the AI boom might be getting ahead of itself as companies overspend on data centers without a meaningful guarantee of future returns. This uncertainty has sent Broadcom's stock down by around 15% from its all-time high of $412.\nLet's dig deeper into the pros and cons of the stock to see if this dip is a buying opportunity or a signal for investors to stay far away.\nWhy are investors getting nervous? The stock's recent slide came after Broadcom's fourth-quarter earnings report in mid-December. On the surface, the numbers were fantastic.\nRevenue jumped 28% year over year to a record of $18 billion, driven by soaring demand for AI semiconductor revenue, which rose 74% in the period. This operating segment reflects sales of Broadcom's advanced computer hardware to AI data centers, and management expects the momentum to continue into 2026 as demand for these products continues to surge.\n\nBroadcom's bottom line is also looking great, with net income doubling to $8.5 billion. With numbers like these, it's hard to believe shares are on a two-week downtrend. However, the correction makes more sense when you look at some of the uncomfortable dynamics of the AI industry itself.\nAccording to analysts at Goldman Sachs , hyperscalers are on track to spend an eye-popping $527 billion on AI-related capital expenditures (capex) , with some of this going to hardware produced by companies like Broadcom. The problem is that the scale of the spending doesn't really match up with the profits generated by AI-related software services.\nDeutsche Bank expects ChatGPT creator OpenAI to lose $140 billion by 2029. And despite being one of the top hardware spenders (with roughly $125 billion in capex for 2025), Amazon saw its cloud computing revenue rise by a relatively modest $5.6 billion compared to the prior-year period. The fear is that eventually shareholders will start to push back on all the AI spending. After all, this is money that could be going to buybacks or dividends.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom might be better positioned than Nvidia It is fair to assume that AI-related capex spending could soon drop to reasonable levels, which could reduce the growth potential of infrastructure providers like Broadcom. That said, the company is better positioned to weather a potential fallout than the industry leader, Nvidia. To understand why, we must first look at the reasons why AI development is so expensive and generally unprofitable right now.\n\nRunning and training large language models like ChatGPT requires thousands of expensive AI accelerators (such as Nvidia's Blackwell series), which consume significant amounts of energy. Broadcom's semiconductor business actually helps solve this problem by helping its clients develop appl ication-specific integrated circui ts (ASICs). These are custom chips designed to do a specific workload, making them cheaper and easier to run than Nvidia's large, general-purpose chips.\nObviously, ASICs won't be the magic bullet that makes AI companies stop burning through money. But they are the natural first step as companies seek to reduce their reliance on expensive third-party hardware. In October, cloud giant Google selected Broadcom to build its first in-house AI processor chips. This development follows a deal with OpenAI to co-develop AI accelerators and Ethernet solutions.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy? Broadcom's ability to benefit from the transition to custom chips makes it a strong bet in the generative AI opportunity. That said, the AI boom is getting long in the tooth, and investors may want to wait until there is more clarity about the sustainability of current industry hardware spending before taking a position in such a highly exposed stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Dear AMD Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 5\n\nChris MacDonald\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:08 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nAmong the world's largest semiconductor makers, Nvidia (NVDA) remains the go-to choice for investors. And rightfully so—looking at this stock's long-term chart, investors who have stuck with this name have outperformed the market by an incredible margin in recent decades.\nOf course, it's not just a one-horse race, regardless of what the media tries to tell you. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is another top name worth considering, and one that's actually outperformed Nvidia on a year-to-date basis (YTD). Surging 77% to end 2025, AMD roughly doubled Nvidia's performance this year (the world's largest chipmaker still surged 39% higher in 2025, so not bad). Thus, there are plenty of eyeballs already on AMD as 2026 kicks off.\n\nMore News from Barchart NVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\nAfter Record Runs for Western Digital and Sandisk in 2025, Consider This 1 Data Center Storage Stock for 2026\nCrowdStrike Insiders Are Offloading CRWD Stock.

Sign Up Now!\nAs it turns out, there's another major catalyst on the horizon investors are watching when it comes to both companies. Analysts at Wedbush have pointed out that AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, is expected to make the keynote address at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on this date, with the potential for a big announcement to come.\n\nWhy Is This Catalyst So Important for AMD? I think the key announcements for AMD for this coming year are indeed likely to come at this event. CES is the biggest show in the world when it comes to anything tied to consumer electronics and is honestly one of the key shows I've always wanted to attend, for this reason. Many CEOs are expected to make big product announcements, from technological upgrades to next-generation technology expected to be released over the course of the year.\n\nI'd expect to see a strong narrative from Lisa Su around the company's roadmap moving forward, and Wedbush analysts tend to agree. They think that some “significant” technological improvements to AMD's core Ryzen chips could be announced at this conference. Doing so may propel a range of mega-cap tech companies who are looking for reasons to buy AMD chips (at a lower price point) to do so. Especially if the output differential between these Ryzen chips and Nvidia's new Blackwell and Rubin chips isn't as wide as it appears now.\n\nStory Continues\nWe'll have to see, of course, what is ultimately announced. But any sort of meaningful improvements in AMD's core CPU chip technology could spur greater investor interest in 2026 and take this stock's recent momentum to new levels. It does appear that AMD has retained strong pricing power, reflected in the company's margins above. If these margins expand further in the coming quarters, and AMD can show a cash flow growth profile that's above Wall Street estimates, I certainly think this is a stock that could be off to the races.\n\nSo, What Does Wall Street Think? As it turns out, Wedbush is just one of 44 analysts currently covering AMD stock. With a consensus price target of $285.05 per share on AMD stock, analysts believe that this chipmaker could have roughly 33% upside from current levels.\nThat's a healthy potential gain for investors looking to add some momentum to their portfolios in 2026. Indeed, momentum-driven growth stocks have provided most of the gains in the markets over the course of the past decade and a half. Thus, for those who think this trend is likely to continue and risk-on sentiment will remain in the coming year, AMD's fundamentals do point in a very positive direction right now.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Those who invested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) five years ago are up 89%\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nGenerally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 59% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 28%, including dividends.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.9% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 58.57.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Analog Devices will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective It's nice to see that Analog Devices shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Analog Devices has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory Continues\nOf course Analog Devices may not be the best stock to buy .

At the same time, the S&P 500 has returned 9.9%.\nIs now the time to buy QCOM? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nWhy Does QCOM Stock Spark Debate? Having been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\nTwo Positive Attributes: 1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Luckily, Qualcomm’s sales grew at an impressive 15.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n2. Stellar ROIC Showcases Lucrative Growth Opportunities Growth gives us insight into a company’s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? A company’s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nQualcomm’s five-year average ROIC was 47%, placing it among the best semiconductor companies. This illustrates its management team’s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\nOne Reason to be Careful: Projected Revenue Growth Is Slim Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Qualcomm’s revenue to rise by 3%, a deceleration versus its 15.3% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nFinal Judgment Qualcomm’s merits more than compensate for its flaws, but at $171.30 per share (or 14.2× forward P/E), is now the time to initiate a position?

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】大摩日前發布報告，點名亞洲AI前十強，其中台灣包含台積電、聯發科、京元電、信驊、世芯、創意等6檔上榜，統一投顧總經理、PCB女王廖婉婷認為，6檔當中世芯股價低、成長性夠，是2026開門就可以找買點的個股；如果眼光放遠，創意、聯發科續航力強勁；而台積電則是「神主牌」，本土法人遲早會回補。\n\n大摩選的台股六強都是優質個股，如果硬要挑該如何選擇？廖婉婷在「鈔錢部署」中表示，自己會先考慮獲利成長性，如果基期夠低，2026就比較有機會。\n\n她以世芯-KY(3661)為例，2025業績呈現衰退，但因為它是AWS Trainium 3供應鏈，屬於後段ASIC供應商，因此2026的業績貢獻度會很大，光是AWS貢獻世芯營收成長就接近1倍，獲利更會有1倍以上的成長，目前本益比才20出頭，空間還蠻大。\n\n世芯前3季歸屬母公司業主淨利為41.14億元，年減10.7％，每股純益為50.89元，較去年同期58.43元衰退13%，主因是北美主要CSP客戶5奈米AI晶片在2025年畫句點，法人預估世芯2025年EPS為67.8元。\n\n廖婉婷表示，世芯大客戶AWS的Trainium 3大概會在第2季出，通常法人布局都會提前1季，因此當跨入元月1日、2026第1季剛開始的時候就可以加碼。\n\n除世芯外，2026年會打進馬斯克的xAI的創意(3443)，也是廖婉婷長期看好個股。馬斯克先前發下豪語，2027年的AI晶片需求會比全市場目前用的GPU加ASIC來得更多。\n\n大客戶因台積電產能，喜歡和台灣ASIC廠合作廖婉婷分析，如果以Robotaxi，加上他的AI機器人大軍有可能成真，果真如此，對創意2027年的業績貢獻將會很大。\n\n另外聯發科(2454)也是從消費性產品打進ASIC市場，不過它Google的TPU下一代要等到2026年下半年、甚至第4季才可能出貨，所以業績貢獻會比較慢，但市場認為，即使到2027年再下一代，聯發科還是會是供應商。\n\n對於國外的客戶偏好找台灣的IP廠商合作ASIC，廖婉婷說，原因是台廠和台積電合作緊密，大家都想拿到台積電的產能，再加上台灣的封測產業很強，因此讓國際大廠頻頻登門合作。\n\n廖婉婷評估大摩挑選的6檔中，世芯因為股價低、成長性夠強，會有很大的成長空間，被認為是首選；但如果需要續航力、把眼光放大2027年，創意和聯發科都有很大成長機會。\n\n至於台積電是「神主牌」，廖婉婷說，一定會帶領台股再創新高，台股現在本益比23、24倍，台積電本益比才20倍，對台積電而言股價太委屈。\n\n她分析，主要是先前外資放假、內資減碼，加上年底壽險銀行必須獲利了結，以及會計制度改變，以及外價金的提列得減碼，所以很多金控銀行壽險年底會減低持股，明年第1季外資、本土法人會回補台積電，台積電的本益比至少應回到22倍到24倍之上。\n\n※免責聲明：文中所提之個股、ETF內容，並非任何投資建議與參考，請審慎判斷評估風險，自負盈虧。(新聞來源：旺得富理財網 王郁惠)",

      "Content": "MoneyDJ新聞 2026-01-02 10:26:10 黃立安 發佈\n\n半導體矽智財(IP)龍頭Arm針對2026年及未來發展趨勢發布20項技術預測，Arm認為2026年將邁入智慧運算新紀元，屆時運算將具備更高的模組化特性和能源效率表現，實現雲端、實體終端及邊緣AI環境的無縫互聯。法人看好ASIC暨矽智財族群包括創意(3443)、世芯-KY(3661)、智原(3035)、巨有(8227)等營運有望迎來一波高成長，而IC設計業者如瑞昱(2379)、聯詠(3034)、天鈺(4961)等也在邊緣AI佈局下，有望帶動新的成長動能。\n\nArm指出，隨著製程微縮成本持續攀升，產業正由單片式晶片轉向模組化小晶片設計，透過將運算、記憶體與I/O等功能拆分為可重複使用的模組，晶片設計業者可彈性搭配不同製程節點，不僅有助於降低研發成本，也能加快產品導入市場的速度。\n\n產業界亦觀察到，可高度客製的小晶片模組正快速崛起，這類模組可整合通用運算核心、特定領域加速器及專用AI引擎，讓晶片團隊無需從零開始，即可打造差異化SoC產品，大幅縮短設計週期並降低創新門檻。且隨著開放標準逐步成熟，不同廠商的小晶片可望實現可靠互通，進一步擴大供應鏈選擇，形塑以互通性元件為核心的新生態系。\n\n在AI運算架構上，Arm認為，特定領域加速技術已成為效能提升關鍵，但未來競爭焦點不再只是通用CPU與加速器的簡單分工，而是朝向系統級協同設計演進。晶片將從系統層面與軟體堆疊同步最佳化，針對特定AI框架、資料型態與工作負載進行深度調校，以達成效能與能效的最優解。\n\n雲端服務商已率先實踐此一方向，包括AWS的Graviton、Google Cloud的Axion及Microsoft Azure的Cobalt，皆採用從底層即整合CPU、加速器、記憶體與互連的設計思維，打造高度客製化的平台架構。Arm認為，這將加速次世代AI資料中心落地，在有限空間內極大化AI算力，同時有效降低能耗與整體運行成本。\n\n法人指出，Arm所描繪的技術路線，對ASIC暨矽智財族群帶來中長期結構性利多。隨著客製化晶片與小晶片設計需求快速升溫，具備先進製程與系統級設計能力的ASIC業者，將在雲端服務商與大型AI客戶專案中扮演關鍵角色，包括創意、世芯-KY、智原及巨有等業者，均有望受惠於高階加速器與客製SoC專案增加，帶動營收與獲利的成長動能。\n\n在IC設計端，邊緣AI加速普及亦被視為下一波成長契機。Arm預期，AI推論任務將持續由雲端下沉至終端裝置，2026年邊緣AI將從基礎資料分析，進一步升級至即時推論與動態適配能力，並可承載更複雜模型運行。法人看好，瑞昱、聯詠、天鈺等IC設計業者，隨著AI功能導入電視、顯示器、PC、消費性與工控設備，產品單價與附加價值提升，有助於開啟新的成長曲線。",

      "Content": "The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10%\n\nSam Quirke, MarketBeat\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 11:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nKey Points Qualcomm’s MACD just flipped bearish again, and the stock is already slipping after a strong run from April.\nA similar signal in early November was followed by a fast, double-digit drop, making this setup hard to ignore.\nThe near-term “tell” is whether buyers defend the low-$170s, or whether the stock breaks down ahead of February earnings.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAfter showing many promising signs over the past quarter, shares of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) are flashing a sudden warning signal as the new year begins. Just before Christmas, the stock’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) chart logged a bearish crossover, confirming a momentum shift that has continued into this week. The mega-cap tech stock closed just below $174 on Dec. 30, still up roughly 40% since April, but also down about 15% from the late-October surge that briefly reignited bullish enthusiasm.\nSince then, however, Qualcomm has been narrowing into a tight range, and while its long-term fundamentals remain supportive, its short-term technicals are flashing caution. What makes it all the more noteworthy is that the last time this exact setup appeared, the outcome was not kind to the bulls. Could history be about to repeat itself? Let’s jump in and take a closer look.\n\n→ Hi Ho Silver Away! Silver Breaks $80 as Poor Man's Gold Explodes\nWhat Qualcomm’s Bearish MACD Crossover Signals Now The MACD is a momentum indicator that tracks the relationship between two moving averages. When the shorter-term average crosses below the longer-term one, it’s regarded as a reliable signal that upside momentum is fading and that sellers are beginning to gain the upper hand. Importantly, this is not just an intraday wobble. The crossover that appeared just before Christmas has now continued and picked up pace into this week.\n\nThat matters because MACD signals tend to be more reliable when they appear after extended rallies. Qualcomm’s run since April has been one of its most sustained in years, and so this sudden divergence could be an early warning that buyers are starting to step back, rather than to continue building positions.\n→ D-Wave vs. IonQ vs. IBM vs. Google: Which Quantum Bets Will Win 2026?\nNow, it doesn’t mean a breakdown from here is inevitable. But it does suggest that the stock is vulnerable if bulls fail to step in soon, especially given how the stock behaved the last time this happened.\nThe Last Time QCOM Flashed This Signal, Shares Dropped 10% The most recent comparison point came less than two months ago in early November. At the time, Qualcomm had also printed a bearish MACD crossover after a strong move to multi-year highs. In a move that surprised us all, what followed was a swift decline of more than 10% over the following two weeks.\n\nStory Continues\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/29 - 01/02\nThe setup then shares several similarities with today. The stock had been moving higher into the middle of December since bottoming out from November’s correction, but in the face of increased selling pressure over the past fortnight, the bulls have been nowhere to be seen.\n\nHistory might not repeat perfectly when it comes to stocks, but it often rhymes. The point isn’t so much that Qualcomm is definitely going to fall another 10% from here; it’s that, at the very least, the stock is flashing a warning signal that is worth noting.\nWhy This Qualcomm Setup Could Play Out Differently There are also reasons not to be overly negative. Unlike early November, Qualcomm hasn’t just retreated from a multi-year high, and is actually starting to trade within a tightening range. With the longer-term uptrend still intact, it could be said to have been coiling into a pre-breakout setup over the past week, more so than starting to break down.\n\nIts fundamentals also look as strong as they have all year, with expectations building for Qualcomm to once again top the consensus in their first earnings report of 2026, due in early February. As we’ve highlighted in recent weeks, too, investor perception has been improving as the company’s diversification efforts continue to build momentum.\nEspecially when the broader equity market is in risk-on mode, this underlying narrative supports higher prices over time, even if the near-term path is choppy. That longer-term view is supported by TradeSmith’s Health Indicator, a volatility-based metric that has consistently ranked Qualcomm in the green zone for six consecutive months.\n\nWhat Bulls Must Do for Qualcomm to Start 2026 Strong Still, for Qualcomm to start 2026 on the right foot, the bulls need to reassert control soon. If the stock continues to drift lower below $172, it would significantly increase the odds of another leg down similar to November’s move.\nConversely, if buyers step in and momentum begins to turn back up, this crossover could prove to be a false alarm within a broader uptrend. Having worked hard to shake off its reputation for exasperating investors with multiple false promises, Qualcomm has earned some benefit of the doubt after its strong performance since April, but that goodwill is not unlimited.\nThe next week or two will tell a lot. A stock can coil only for so long before it has to choose a direction, one way or the other. With its fundamentals pointing higher and technicals pulling in the opposite direction, Qualcomm is approaching a moment of decision.\nThe article \" The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10% \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 15, Goldman Sachs downgraded Arm Holdings to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $120, which was brought down from $160. This decision was made as the firm updated its 2026 semiconductor sector outlook and predicted that rising AI spending by hyperscalers will support digital, memory, and storage markets, while a recovery in the automotive and industrial sectors should benefit analog chips. However, Goldman Sachs downgraded Arm Holdings due to its limited exposure to the AI cycle, its ongoing business model transition, and the challenges it faces in gaining traction across non-traditional markets.\n\nIn FQ2 2026, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) achieved its best FQ2 performance to date, with total revenue reaching $1.14 billion, which was a 34% increase year-on-year. This growth was fueled by record royalty revenue of $620 million (up 21%) and a massive 56% surge in licensing revenue, which totaled $515 million. The licensing spike reflects intense global demand for next-gen AI products and Arm Holdings’ high-efficiency compute architecture. The company also delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of its previous guidance.\nStrategically, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is positioning itself as the primary solution to the power bottlenecks currently hindering data center expansion. The company’s platform is approximately 50% more energy-efficient than its competitors, a factor that has led to widespread adoption by industry giants including Nvidia, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. This efficiency drove ARM’s Neoverse royalties to more than double year-on-year. Furthermore, the company announced a strategic partnership with Meta to optimize AI efficiency and revealed plans to acquire DreamBig Semiconductor to secure critical intellectual property for data center networking and high-speed communications.\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) architects, develops, and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies for semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】世界先進（5347）營運展望維持穩健。法人指出，第四季受惠長約（LTA）收入認列與匯率有利條件，營收與毛利率表現可望與上季持平或略優；展望2026年，雖受新廠驗證與設備取得限制，且新加坡12吋新產能尚未開出，內部視為「過渡年」，但電源管理平台持續擴張、AI伺服器需求放量，加上非中車用與工業市場回溫帶動，全年營收仍有機會維持雙位數成長。\n\n法人分析，世界先進第四季營運表現符合預期，10、11月合併營收合計76.64億元、年增5.7％，主要來自季底額外LTA收入認列，加上近期新台幣兌美元偏弱，有助出口型晶圓代工廠營收與毛利率。\n\n再者，隨電源管理產品比重拉升，產品組合改善亦成為支撐毛利率的重要因素。\n\n時序進入2026年首季，市場原先擔憂傳統淡季效應，但法人認為「淡季不悲觀」。一方面，消費性電子需求自2025年下半年起趨於保守，庫存調整壓力可控；另一方面，記憶體報價飆升，部分顯示驅動IC與相關客戶提前回補庫存，加上車用與工業客戶需求穩定，使得整體產能利用率變化有限。\n\n法人預期，世界先進第一季營收可望持穩，且在產品組合轉佳與匯率條件支撐下，毛利率反而可望微幅提升。\n\n世界先進目前擁有五座8吋晶圓廠，主力製程涵蓋高壓、超高壓、BCD及分離式元件等特殊製程，其中電源管理平台占營收比約75％，為最核心成長動能。\n\n法人指出，AI伺服器對電源管理IC與功率元件用量，較一般伺服器呈倍數成長，日本與美系客戶導入意願高，可望推升世界先進AI相關營收占比至15％，成為未來數年重要結構性成長來源。\n\n也因新廠與產線進度，2026年被定位為過渡年。法人表示，世界先進旗下VSMC已開始移入設備，2026年將進行產線與產品驗證，預計2027年量產，因此2026年尚無實質貢獻。\n\n同時，8吋設備取得難度高，也使台灣既有廠區新增產能相對有限。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一張瑞益／台北報導)",

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 0.14%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.79%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Analog Devices in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.28, showcasing a 39.88% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.11 billion, up 28.21% from the prior-year quarter.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $9.79 per share and a revenue of $12.82 billion, signifying shifts of +25.67% and +16.36%, respectively, from the last year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Analog Devices. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.52% higher. Analog Devices is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\nIn terms of valuation, Analog Devices is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.07. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 44.32 of its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, ADI's PEG ratio is currently 1.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.47.\nThe Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 31, which puts it in the top 13% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

      "Content": "Why Qualcomm (QCOM) Dipped More Than Broader Market Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) closed at $171.05 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.5% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.74%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.63%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.76%.\nComing into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 1.73% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 0.14%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.79%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Qualcomm in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $3.38, showcasing a 0.88% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year.

These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.02% downward. Qualcomm is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nIn the context of valuation, Qualcomm is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 14.29. This denotes a discount relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 35.99.\n\nInvestors should also note that QCOM has a PEG ratio of 3.11 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Electronics - Semiconductors industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.04.\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 96, putting it in the top 39% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

      "Content": "Tower Semiconductor Draws New $109 Million Institutional Stake Amid a 127% Stock Run\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 10:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nAPLD\n\nMTZ\n\nKey Points Florida-based Hood River Capital Management initiated a new stake in Tower Semiconductor, buying up 1.51 million shares in the third quarter.\nThe shares were worth about $109.22 million as of September 30.\nThe position places Tower Semiconductor outside the fund's top five holdings.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nFlorida-based Hood River Capital Management reported a new position in Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) valued at approximately $109.22 million, according to a November 14 SEC filing.\nWhat Happened Hood River Capital Management established a new position in Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) , acquiring 1.51 million shares valued at $109.22 million as of September 30, according to its SEC filing dated November 14. The new stake amounts to 1.29% of the fund’s $8.47 billion in reportable U.S. equity assets, raising its total number of holdings to 152 at quarter-end.\n\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:APLD: $482.81 million (5.7% of AUM)\nNYSE:MTZ: $350.38 million (4.13% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:KTOS: $246.07 million (2.91% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:DAVE: $215.46 million (2.54% of AUM)\nNYSE:FIX: $199.03 million (2.35% of AUM)\nAs of Wednesday, shares of Tower Semiconductor were priced at $118.08, up a staggering 127% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500's 17% gain in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.51 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$195.48 million\nPrice (as of Wednesday)\n$118.08\n\nCompany Snapshot Tower Semiconductor offers analog-intensive mixed-signal semiconductor devices, including SiGe, BiCMOS, RF CMOS, CMOS image sensors, integrated power management, and MEMS, as well as wafer fabrication and design enablement services.\nIt operates as an independent foundry, generating revenue through manufacturing and customizing semiconductor wafers for integrated device manufacturers and fabless companies on a contract basis.\nThe company serves a diversified customer base across consumer electronics, communications, automotive, industrial, aerospace, military, and medical device sectors worldwide.\n\nTower Semiconductor is a leading pure-play foundry specializing in analog and mixed-signal semiconductor manufacturing, with a global footprint and a workforce of over 5,600 employees. The company leverages advanced process technologies and a flexible manufacturing model to address specialized customer requirements in high-growth, high-reliability end markets. Its competitive edge is built on technology customization, deep industry expertise, and broad market reach across multiple geographies and applications.\n\nStory Continues\nFoolish Take This move shows conviction during a staggering stock run. Tower Semiconductor exited the third quarter with momentum across revenue, margins, and capital deployment. Revenue reached $396 million in the third quarter, up 6% sequentially, while net income climbed to $54 million, or $0.48 per share, reflecting operating leverage across its core platforms. Meanwhile, management’s guidance for a record $440 million of revenue in the fourth quarter underscores why some investors are still leaning in despite the stock’s sharp run-up.\n\nWhat also stands out is where Tower is spending. The company committed an additional $300 million to expand SiPho and SiGe capacity, targeting optical transceivers and data center demand, segments with structurally higher margins and long-duration growth drivers.\n\nAnd as for the broader context, this fund’s largest holdings skew toward higher-volatility growth names, suggesting Tower is being used as a quality compounder rather than a speculative swing.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable assets: Assets disclosed by institutional investment managers in quarterly SEC filings, covering U.S. equity holdings.\nAssets under management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or investment firm.\nTop holdings: The largest individual investments in a fund's portfolio, typically ranked by market value or portfolio weight.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nPure-play foundry: A semiconductor company that manufactures chips for other companies but does not design its own products.\nAnalog-intensive mixed-signal: Semiconductor devices combining analog and digital circuits, often used for processing real-world signals.\nSiGe: Silicon-germanium, a semiconductor material used to enhance performance in certain electronic devices.\nBiCMOS: A technology combining bipolar and CMOS transistors on a single chip for improved speed and power efficiency.\nRF CMOS: Radio frequency complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor; technology for integrating radio frequency circuits on standard CMOS chips.\nCMOS image sensors: Devices that convert light into electronic signals, widely used in cameras and imaging equipment.\nMEMS: Microelectromechanical systems; tiny mechanical devices built onto semiconductor chips for sensing or actuation.\nFabless companies: Firms that design semiconductor chips but outsource manufacturing to foundries rather than owning fabrication facilities.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is trading at an all-time high with the share price of $1,279.60 on December 26. This comes after impressive 100.59% year-to-date gains.\nWall Street is bullish ahead of the company’s fiscal Q2 2026 earnings, expected to be released on January 28. Analysts expect the company to post around $3.25 billion in revenue along with a GAAP EPS of $8.49. Recently, on December 19, Deutsche Bank reiterated a Hold rating on the stock without disclosing any price targets. Earlier, on December 16, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $1,400 to $1,450.\nArya of BofA noted that the US semiconductor stocks are attractively positioned for 2026. He sees 2026 as the halfway point of an 8-10 year-long cycle. Arya sees 2026 to be the year of faster IT upgradation, AI utilization, and AI workloads. He cautioned the investors regarding slight choppiness due to increased investor scrutiny on AI return on investment; however, this is expected to be offset by fast AI LLM builders and AI factories.\n\nThat said, on December 15, Blayne Curtis from Jefferies upgraded KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) from Market Perform to Outperform with a $1,500 price target. The analyst believes that the company enjoys a significant edge on a stronger leading edge/packaging outlook. The firm also has a constructive outlook on the wafer fab equipment growth in 2026 and 2027.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced process control equipment and services for the semiconductor and electronics industries, helping chipmakers find tiny defects, improve yields, and enhance quality in making logic chips, memory (like DRAM/NAND), LEDs, and more, essentially providing the high-tech tools to ensure flawless microchip production.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

That matters because about half of GlobalFoundries' revenue comes from those areas.\nThere are still positives.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop Upgrades:\n\nKeefe Bruyette upgraded TeraWulf (WULF) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $24, up from $9.50. The firm believes investors are underestimating the magnitude of TeraWulf's bitcoin mining to high performance compute leasing mix shift in 2026 and 2027.\nClear Street upgraded Plug Power (PLUG) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $3, down from $3.50. The firm sees more attractive upside in the shares following the recent selloff. It cites dilution from Plug Power's convertible refinancing in late November for the target drop.\n\nTop Downgrades:\n\nWedbush downgraded GlobalFoundries (GFS) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $40, down from $42. While the firm believes that GlobalFoundries has a path to a model with stronger revenues, improved utilization, and better margins on improved end market fundamentals and a shift towards local supply chains, it also believes recent developments have elongated the timeframe around when those catalysts might play out, the firm tells investors.\nWedbush downgraded Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) to Neutral from Outperform with a $125 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade, noting that the stock is approaching the firm's target price and the 25-times multiple it uses to value Tower Semiconductor ostensibly already assumes some upside vs. its current estimates.\nTruist downgraded DigitalBridge (DBRG) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $16 following the announced all-cash acquisition by SoftBank Group (SFTBY) at $16 per share. The firm sees a low probability of a competing bid emerging.\nRaymond James double downgraded OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) to Market Perform from Strong Buy without a price target following the company's announcement to acquire Flushing Financial (FFIC) . The firm expects \"significant\" dilution and says the deal slows the benefit of OceanFirst's shift to a stronger core deposit franchise.\nRaymond James downgraded Flushing Financial (FFIC) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company agreed to be acquired by OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) . The deal was done at a fair price given the earnings challenges Flushing has faced due to the challenging rate environment for the past several years, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop Initiations:\n\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Serve Robotics (SERV) with a Buy rating and $16 price target. The firm believes Serve is positioned for \"strong growth and eventual profitability.\"\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of International Bancshares (IBOC) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. While the bank has elevated commercial real estate concentration, interest-rate sensitivity, and exposure to cross-border activity, the firm sees these factors being balanced by strong profitability supported by \"best-in-class\" efficiency and conservative balance sheet positioning.\nFreedom Capital initiated coverage of Butterfly Network (BFLY) with a Buy rating and $5 price target. The firm sees continued revenue expansion for Butterfly, driven by iQ3 probe and enterprise software adoption.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Analog Devices (ADI): Read This Before Placing a Bet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADI Check price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Analog Devices, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ADI Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $9.79.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Analog Devices may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Silicon Motion falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Silicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share, indicating a change of +44% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 points to a change of +3.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.88 indicates a change of +37.5% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nStory continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $260.55 million indicates a year-over-year change of +36.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $863.29 million and $1.05 billion estimates indicate +7.4% and +21.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $242 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.07 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.52%. The EPS surprise was +23.46%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "KLA (KLAC) Suffers a Larger Drop Than the General Market: Key Insights\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nKLA (KLAC) ended the recent trading session at $1,243.65, demonstrating a -1.33% change from the preceding day's closing price.

In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $3.24 billion, indicating a 5.39% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nKLAC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $35.44 per share and revenue of $13.04 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.49% and +7.31%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for KLA. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.1% upward. KLA is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\nIn the context of valuation, KLA is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 35.57. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.48, so one might conclude that KLA is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that KLAC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.36. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

      "Content": "PLTR vs. ARM: Which AI-Tech Stock is the Better Buy Now?\n\nShuvra Shankar Dey\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nARM\n\nPalantir Technologies PLTR and Arm Holdings ARM are both deeply aligned with the same powerful theme: the accelerating global adoption of artificial intelligence. Each plays a foundational role in enabling AI at scale.\nPalantir supports AI deployment through sophisticated data integration, analytics and decision-making platforms that help organizations operationalize complex data. ARM underpins AI progress at the hardware level by licensing energy-efficient processor architectures that power AI workloads across mobile devices, cloud infrastructure and data centers. While their offerings differ, both companies occupy critical points in the AI value chain, directly benefiting from the rising demand for intelligent, scalable computing solutions from enterprises, governments and consumers.\n\nThe Case for PLTR Palantir has strategically positioned itself to capitalize on the changing dynamics of the AI economy.\nAt the core of Palantir’s strategy is its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which enables businesses to structure and organize their data, whether financial, supply chain, operational or HR-related, so that AI can process and execute tasks more effectively. By leveraging an ontology-driven approach, Palantir creates digital representations of entire enterprises, allowing AI to interact seamlessly with business operations. Unlike companies that contribute to the oversupply of AI models, Palantir is actively shaping the demand side of the AI economy, positioning itself as a key player in the adoption of enterprise AI.\n\nPalantir’s financial health further reinforces its investment appeal. As of Sept. 30, 2025, the company held $6.4 billion in cash and equivalents, with zero debt, providing ample liquidity to invest in growth initiatives.\nMoreover, Palantir’s recent financial performance underscores its strength. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues surged 63% year over year, with U.S. revenues increasing 77% year over year and U.S. commercial business experiencing 121% growth. The company closed 204 deals of at least $1 million, 91 deals of at least $5 million and 53 deals of at least $10 million in the quarter.\nThe company achieved its highest-ever adjusted operating margin of 51%, reflecting the scalability of its software business model and disciplined cost control. GAAP operating income reached $393 million, while GAAP net income came in at $476 million, translating to GAAP EPS of 18 cents and adjusted EPS of 21 cents, which increased 110% year over year.\n\nThe Case for ARM Arm Holdings’ foundational advantage in power-efficient chip architecture continues to anchor its dominance in mobile computing, but its influence extends far beyond smartphones and tablets. Long known for enabling energy-saving designs for Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Samsung, Arm is becoming increasingly central as these companies accelerate their focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nStory Continues\nARM’s unique ability to deliver high performance with minimal power makes its architecture ideal for an era where intelligence is embedded everywhere, from wearables to edge devices and cloud infrastructure. AI models are being deployed across a wide array of consumer and enterprise products, and Arm’s flexible, power-thrifty designs are being adopted to support these new workloads. Apple continues to rely on ARM-based architecture for its M-series chips as it deepens AI integration across its devices. Qualcomm is using ARM designs to drive AI-enhanced smartphones and automotive platforms, while Samsung leverages ARM’s technology across mobile, consumer electronics and its expanding Exynos portfolio targeting AI and IoT applications.\n\nThe reliance of these major tech players on Arm Holdings is not only consistent but also strengthening. As Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung scale their AI ambitions and broaden their IoT ecosystems, they depend even more on ARM’s ability to deliver power-efficient performance at global scale. The company’s ongoing push to optimize its architecture for machine learning and edge computing ensures tight alignment with the emerging needs of its top customers.\nAs a result, Arm Holdings is evolving from a mobile-centric enabler to a critical AI and IoT infrastructure layer for the world’s leading device makers, solidifying its strategic importance across the broader technology landscape.\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for PLTR & ARM? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR’s 2025 sales and EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 54% and 78%, respectively. EPS estimates have been trending upward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARM’s fiscal 2026 sales and EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 21.5% and 5.5%, respectively. EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nARM’s Valuation More Attractive Than PLTR While ARM appears attractively valued with a forward 12-month P/E of 52.93X versus its median of 121.35X, suggesting that the stock could be undervalued relative to its historical range, PLTR is trading at a forward 12-month P/E of 177.24X, below its 12-month median of 308.7X.\nPLTR Seems a Choice In the current AI-driven market environment, Palantir stands out as the more compelling choice. While both companies benefit from long-term AI adoption, Palantir is more directly tied to real-world AI execution and enterprise decision-making. Its platforms are already embedded in mission-critical operations across commercial and government sectors, creating durable demand and high switching costs. Palantir’s focus on operational AI positions it on the front lines of adoption rather than infrastructure dependency. With stronger momentum, clearer AI monetization and a Buy rating compared with Arm’s Hold stance, Palantir offers greater upside for investors seeking exposure to AI as a transformative business force rather than a supporting technology layer.\n\nWhile PLTR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), ARM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in KLA Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\nFor most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in KLA (KLAC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to KLAC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nKLA's Business In-Depth With that in mind, let's take a look at KLA's main business drivers.\nSan Jose, CA-based KLA Corporation is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of process diagnostics and control (PDC) equipment and yield management solutions required for the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) or chips. The company has a comprehensive portfolio of products addressing each major PDC subsegment&mdash;photomask (reticle) inspection, wafer inspection/defect review and metrology.\n\nReticle production is vital to the semiconductor device formation process. Reticles are used to control the precise deposition of materials onto the wafer, which ultimately change its chemical characteristics, imparting specific functionalities to the ICs thus created. Inspection and metrology tools measure the quality of the reticles, helping to improve reticle production yields. As a result of the broader applicability of semiconductors, shrinking form factors and increasing functionalities of individual chips, reticle design and production are growing in importance. Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor were the largest customers in the last three years, accounting for more than 10% of total sales in each year.\n\nKLA reported revenues of $12.16 billion in fiscal 2025. Product revenues accounted for 78% while the rest came from Service segment.\n\nKLA&rsquo;s two main product lines are defect inspection and metrology. The company&rsquo;s defect inspection tools have very broad application in chip, wafer, reticle, storage, compound semiconductor and MEMS manufacturing. Metrology tools are used to gather critical dimension measurements of the wafer and process dimensions such as film thickness, lithography overlay and surface profiling. The company&rsquo;s metrology products are used in chip, wafer, reticle and solar device manufacturing. KLA also offers other products and services.\n\nIn addition to new tools, KLA also offers a comprehensive portfolio of refurbished tools that upgrade and improve yields of existing equipment under the KT-Certified program. Refurbished tools are currently sold to IC, reticle, substrate, MEMS and data storage manufacturers.\n\nAlthough KLA is a major player in each of its served markets, it faces competition from other large equipment suppliers such as Applied Materials and Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation.\n\nStory Continues\nBottom Line While anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in KLA ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in December 2015 would be worth $18,031.33, or a 1,703.13% gain, as of December 30, 2025, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 232.27% and the price of gold increased 293.02% over the same time frame in comparison.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for KLAC.\nKLA's fiscal first-quarter revenues and earnings increased year over year. The uptick can be attributed to strong demand in leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging, which drove growth in the semiconductor industry. Advanced packaging is expected to exceed $925 million in 2025. The company's robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. The services business also performed well, contributing significantly to revenue growth. KLA is well-positioned to capitalize on AI advancements, with AI driving demand for higher-value wafer processing and more complex designs. However, extended U.S. export controls on China impacted revenues in the reported quarter. Tariff-related uncertainties also impacted the company's performance.\nThe stock is up 8.92% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2025. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The Mac segment is expected to face a tough year-over-year comparison, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate.\n\nHowever, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> )\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past six months (+14% vs. +13.6%). The company&rsquo;s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk's acquisition enhances the company&rsquo;s recurring revenue base.\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco&rsquo;s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco&rsquo;s security portfolio.\n\nNetworking sales benefited from strong demand for AI infrastructure and campus networking solutions. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers were strong driven by high double-digit order growth in hyperscalers. However, stiffening competition is a headwind.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>> )\n\nIBM&rsquo;s shares have gained +4.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry&rsquo;s gain of +47.8%. The company is betting big on the Watsonx platform, which is likely to be its core technology platform for AI capabilities. The company&rsquo;s focus on quantum technology for solutions to complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing is a tailwind.\n\nIBM is benefiting from a surge in demand for heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has led to sustainable growth through advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nHowever, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Macroeconomic headwinds are worrisome. IBM&rsquo;s acquisition spree has also escalated integration risks, while its high debt level is burdensome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> )\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights International Business Machines, Analog Devices, Johnson & Johnson's, The Gap and Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:14 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nJNJ\n\nHPE\n\nADI\n\nGAP\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI, Johnson & Johnson&rsquo;s JNJ, The Gap, Inc. GAP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop 5 High-Yield S&P 500 Stock to Buy for 2026\nThe U.S. stock market has experienced significant volatility at the beginning of 2025 owing to a multitude of factors. The trade policy framework undertaken in the new Trump administration has reshaped market sentiment. The aggressive tariff measures imposed by Washington on its major trading partners have left several businesses in a state of uncertainty. The growing Sino-U.S. trade tension was a concerning factor for investors. The U.S. government aims to limit Beijing&rsquo;s access to high-end technologies. It has imposed restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor tech to China.\nThe tariff-related uncertainties have significantly affected companies with a strong presence in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Moreover, the war in Europe and the Middle East has further aggravated the market uncertainty. These developments have led to rising manufacturing costs and supply chain issues, putting pressure on margins. However, there were some positive macroeconomic developments as well in 2025. The federal reserve rate cuts have lowered borrowing costs and improved corporate profitability.\n\nTrade-related risks and changes in monetary policy led to frequent stock price fluctuations. However, broader market momentum remained positive with tech stocks largely leading the bull run. Growing spending on AI infrastructure and digital transformation is driving growth in the tech sector. Despite a hike in energy prices, the overall annual inflation rate was lower than expected in 2025.\nKey Growth Drivers for 2026\nRapid AI buildouts are expected to be a key driver for businesses in 2026. Businesses in several industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, social ecommerce, telecom and others are rapidly incorporating AI across the portfolio to gain a competitive edge. However, this rapid AI build-out requires substantial computing infrastructure, data centers to support these AI workloads, as well as energy optimization and cooling technologies.\n\nStory Continues\nAI integration has become capex-heavy. There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.\n\nChina is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government&rsquo;s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.\nAmid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.\n\nKey Picks\nInternational Business Machines Corp. : Headquartered in Armonk, NY, IBM is a leading provider of cloud and data platforms.

      "Content": "CRDO vs. MRVL: Which Data Center Connectivity Stock Is Smarter Pick?\n\nVaishali Doshi\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRDO\n\nMRVL\n\nCredo Technology Group Holding Ltd . ( CRDO ) and Marvell Technology, Inc . ( MRVL ) are semiconductor companies that specialize in high-speed connectivity solutions that are essential for AI-driven data centers.\nAmid rapid artificial intelligence (AI) proliferation, investors are focusing on companies that offer the infrastructure behind it. Semiconductor companies are at the core of AI workloads as these offer solutions to enable augmented processing power and efficiency. CRDO and Marvell are key players in this domain and bring to the table unique strengths. This makes it an intriguing comparison for investors.\n\nNow the question arises: which stock makes a better investment pick at present? Let us dive into the fundamentals, valuations, growth outlook and risks for each company.\nThe Case for CRDO Credo’s leadership in the AEC space is one of its biggest catalysts. AEC business remains its fastest-growing segment. CRDO noted that AECs, now scaling to 100-gig per lane and transitioning to 200-gig per lane architectures, have become the “de facto” standard for inter-rack connectivity. These are now replacing optical rack-to-rack connections of up to 7 meters. The increasing adoption of zero-flap AECs is mainly due to these cables offering up to 1,000 times more reliability with 50% lower power consumption than optical solutions, added CRDO.\n\nBeyond AECs, Credo’s IC portfolio, which includes retimers and optical DSPs, continued to show a healthy performance. Credo’s PCIe retimer program remains on track for design wins in fiscal 2026 and revenue contributions in the next fiscal year.\nOne of the most important recent developments for Credo is its introduction of three growth pillars, each representing a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. These include Zero-Flap (“ZF”) optics, active LED cables (ALCs) and OmniConnect gearboxes (Weaver).\nZF optics is a laser-based connectivity solution delivering AEC-level reliability through a custom optical DSP tightly integrated with Credo’s software stack. The optics are already in live data-center trials, with sampling to a second U.S. hyperscaler expected later in fiscal 2026. ALCs utilize micro-LEDs, delivering AEC-level reliability and power efficiency, and support up to 30-meter connections for row-scale data center networks. Sampling is planned for fiscal 2027, with revenues in fiscal 2028. Credo expects the ALC market to grow to more than twice the size of the AEC market. OmniConnect gearboxes are designed to optimize XDU connectivity.\nCredo now has five main high-growth pillars — AECs, IC solutions (retimers and optical DSPs), Zero-Flap optics, ALCs and OmniConnect gearboxes. Collectively, these present a total market opportunity likely to surpass $10 billion, more than tripling Credo’s market reach just 18 months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Case for MRVL Marvell is a semiconductor company with a diversified product portfolio that includes custom ASICs, data center switches and 5G chips. The company’s strategic pivot to prioritize the data center market is proving to be a successful growth catalyst. The data center end market emerged as the company's largest segment, with revenue contribution of 73% in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. The company's custom XPU silicon, electro-optic interconnect products and next-generation switch offerings are the primary drivers of its strong data center performance.\n\nInterconnect business remains impressive. The increasing demand for AECs and retimers, driven by the shift to high-speed PAM-based solutions, is likely to drive revenues from this segment moving forward. It has been working with the cable ecosystem to enable 100 and 200 gig per lane AECs and is likely to begin significant product ramps. It also noted that PCIe Gen6 retimers are also witnessing “broad traction.”\nThe data center switching business remains another catalyst with revenues expected to exceed $300 million in fiscal 2026 and top $500 million in fiscal 2027. Drivers include sustained demand for 12.8T platforms and accelerating ramps of next-generation 51.2T switches. Meanwhile, development is underway for 100T architectures, which are set to be introduced next year.\n\nThe company has been divesting non-core assets (like the Automotive Ethernet business) while layering in acquisitions, such as Avera, Aquantia , Inphi and Innovium , and now Celestial AI (expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027). Celestial AI specializes in the Photonic Fabric technology platform. This platform is purpose-built for scale-up optical interconnect. Management highlighted that Celestial AI is “deeply engaged” with several hyperscalers and ecosystem partners. Celestial AI has already won a major contract with one of the biggest hyperscalers. This hyperscaler intends to use the photonic fabric chiplets in its next-generation scale-up architecture.\nStrong cash flow and subsequent buybacks enhance Marvell’s appeal. Marvell has returned $1.35 billion through buybacks (including ASR) and dividends in the fiscal third quarter, highlighting financial flexibility even while investing.\n\nPrice Performances & Valuations of CRDO & MRVL In the past month, CRDO and MRVL have declined 15.3% and 5.2%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price/sales ratio, Credo is trading at 17.53X, higher than Marvell’s 7.44X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO? Analysts have revised earnings estimates 30% upward for CRDO for the current fiscal year in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThere is a marginal upward revision for MRVL’s bottom line\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCRDO or MRVL: Which Is a Better Pick? Credo and Marvell are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI-driven data center market.\nCRDO currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Marvell carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Is Marvell (MRVL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Marvell Technology (MRVL).\n\nMarvell currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 24 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 5.6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MRVL Check price target & stock forecast for Marvell here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Marvell, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in MRVL? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marvell, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.1% over the past month to $2.84.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marvell.

      "Content": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Is Using Debt Safely\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nDavid Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Analog Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADI ) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nWhen Is Debt A Problem? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Analog Devices Carry? The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at November 2025 Analog Devices had debt of US$8.60b, up from US$7.62b in one year. However, it also had US$3.65b in cash, and so its net debt is US$4.95b.\nHow Strong Is Analog Devices' Balance Sheet? According to the last reported balance sheet, Analog Devices had liabilities of US$3.25b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$10.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.65b in cash and US$1.44b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$9.09b.\n\nOf course, Analog Devices has a titanic market capitalization of US$135.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Analog Devices\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nStory Continues\nAnalog Devices's net debt is only 0.99 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 14.1 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, Analog Devices grew its EBIT by 45% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Analog Devices can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Analog Devices actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.\nOur View The good news is that Analog Devices's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. It looks Analog Devices has no trouble standing on its own two feet, and it has no reason to fear its lenders. For investing nerds like us its balance sheet is almost charming. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Analog Devices you should know about.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

      "Content": "【時報記者王逸芯台北報導】智原（3035）旗下小金雞、32位元微控制器（MCU）設計廠雅特力-KY（6907）預計於明年1月在櫃買中心掛牌。智原董事長、同時也是雅特力-KY董事長王國雍今日表示，目前公司營運表現相當不錯，雅特力持續深耕主流MCU應用，並從中尋找可發揮的利基市場，包括機器人、無人機以及電競等新興應用，看好今年營收可望再優於去年，對明年展望亦抱持正向態度。\n\n王國雍指出，MCU本身是一項可銷售十年以上的產品，但實際上單一客戶的使用週期可能僅兩至三年，在工控等應用中則可能拉長至十年不等，因此公司在營運評估上，會更著重整體底站與出貨結構。目前公司整體狀況良好，去年營收年增達60%，在整體MCU市場仍承壓之際，已率先繳出明顯成長成績；今年營收預期將再優於去年，且底站動能仍接近歷史高點水準，為明年營運奠定穩定基礎。\n\n王國雍進一步表示，第四季多項晶片幾乎銷售一空，目前正積極推動晶圓代工產能加量，主因新應用放量速度快，例如無人機等需求持續拉升，部分客戶甚至出現供貨吃緊的情況。從庫存面來看，無論是代理商、經銷商或終端客戶端，整體庫存水位皆偏低，也成為支撐明年營運的重要正向指標。\n\n雅特力-KY亦積極布局車用及特殊MCU應用領域。副總經理黃呈俊指出，車用市場的應用範圍相當廣泛，目前公司產品已通過AEC-Q100認證，車用應用本身也具備多個層次，公司現階段著力較多的是車載、耐用度要求較高、且具備實際出貨量的應用領域，整體車用相關營收占比約在一成多。至於AI與機器人應用，公司認為目前仍處於產業初期，但更看重其中長期成長潛力。\n\n針對MCU市場競爭態勢，王國雍表示，若晶片功能單純，確實難以做出差異化，這也是8位元市場高度內捲的主因；但在32位元MCU領域，公司採取全產品公規策略，涵蓋多元應用，即使導入車規相關設計，也不僅限於汽車市場，而是透過高規格品質驗證，提升其他高可靠度應用客戶的信任感。\n\n黃呈俊補充，所謂「內捲」在任何產業競爭中其實都是長期存在的現象，但MCU所屬產業結構相對特殊，具備少量多樣、客群分散、屬於長期且穩定的常態性市場特性，並非典型的「贏者全拿」型產業；相較外商競爭對手，公司在價格策略上更具彈性，能提供具吸引力的報價，但產品效能並不遜色。若與大陸廠商相比，公司則在產品品質與可靠度上更具優勢，這與台灣半導體產業長期累積的技術基礎與製造經驗密不可分。實務上，一項產品動輒數千美元，客戶不會因為幾毛美元的價差輕易更換供應商，因為整體系統導入涉及龐大的工程成本與時間投入，最終仍高度仰賴品牌信任與長期穩定性；也因此，即便市場競爭激烈、價格壓力升高，公司仍能在內捲環境中以產品、品質與服務正面競爭，維持長期競爭力。\n\n營收占比上，雅特力-KY 目前大陸市場營收占比約落在八成至九成之間，部分時間點甚至接近九成，不過整體結構也正逐步出現變化，這與地緣政治因素及產業供需循環有一定關聯。從國際競爭來看，主要對手為ST（意法半導體），其在疫情初期因大缺貨，與多家客戶簽訂長期供貨合約，隨著這幾年市場逐步去化，部分韓國等海外客戶的長約已陸續到期，公司在海外市場，包括韓國、台灣及亞太地區品牌的設計導入與用量明顯回升，像電競領域已成功打入全球最大電競品牌廠。整體來看，台灣與海外營收占比已由過去約一成出頭，逐步往11%、12%以上提升，但由於大陸市場營收同步成長，兩者在比例上仍呈現拉鋸狀態，目前台灣加海外合計約占十多個百分點。",

On December 16, Bank of America raised the firm’s price target on KLA Corporation to $1,450 from $1,400, while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. BofA is adjusting its price targets across the US semiconductor sector and suggests that 2026 marks the halfway point of a decade-long transition toward upgrading traditional IT infrastructure for AI-driven workloads. Stock volatility may persist as investors scrutinize AI returns and hyperscaler spending, but the firm believes that this pressure will be balanced by the expansion of AI factories and LLM developers.\n\nOn the same day, Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded KLA Corporation to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $1,500, up from $1,350. After beating the S&P 500 by 30 points in 2025, the SOX is expected to remain a market leader through 2026. Cantor Fitzgerald believes that the scale of AI infrastructure spending outweighs any short-term cyclical concerns.\nEarlier on December 15, Jefferies upgraded the company to Buy from Hold with a price target of $1,500, up from $1,100. The firm cited KLA Corporation’s dominant position in leading-edge manufacturing as AI scales and believes that the current buildout will catalyze demand for advanced chips, memory, and packaging technologies. With the stock’s valuation recently resetting to more attractive levels, Jefferies sees KLA Corporation as a primary beneficiary of the accelerating investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and markets process control, process-enabling, and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries worldwide.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Silicon Motion (SIMO) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 26, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) closed the most recent trading day at $90.23, moving +1.29% from the previous trading session. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.03% loss on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.04%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.09%.\nThe stock of chip company has risen by 1.71% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.66% and undershooting the S&P 500's gain of 2.57%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Silicon Motion in its upcoming release. On that day, Silicon Motion is projected to report earnings of $1.31 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 43.96%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $260.55 million, up 36.3% from the year-ago period.\nSIMO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.55 per share and revenue of $863.29 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +3.5% and +7.43%, respectively.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Silicon Motion. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Currently, Silicon Motion is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note Silicon Motion's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 25.09. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 25.22 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that SIMO currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.19. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.11.\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 20, finds itself in the top 9% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The standout performers have been companies aggressively pivoting to AI.\n\nIREN (IREN) led with a massive +300% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled by major GPU cloud deals and Microsoft&#x27;s backing .\nCipher Mining (CIFR) followed strongly at +230%, expanding AI hosting partnerships specifically with Fluidstack .\nHut 8 (HUT) also soared, up around +139%, capped by its recent AI announcement : a $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease for 245 MW at its River Bend site in Louisiana.\nIn contrast, three of the four largest bitcoin holders among public miners underperformed the AI/HPC miners.\nMarathon Digital (MARA), the top BTC hodler among miners with 53,250 BTC, dropped -44% YTD. CleanSpark (CLSK) (13,011 BTC) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) (19,324 BTC) saw modest gains of 16% and 32% respectively, without aggressive AI diversification until much later in the year.\n\nCore Scientific (CORZ) stayed independent after shareholders rejected a $9 billion all-stock takeover bid from CoreWeave in October, betting on higher standalone value amid AI demand. Its shares are up just 9% year-to-date.\nBitdeer Technologies (BTDR), the biggest underperforming mining company in the sector, is down around 50%. The bulk of the losses came after its Q3 earnings announcement, when the company reported a larger-than-anticipated net loss and disclosed a delay to its ASIC chip, adding uncertainty around its AI expansion plans.\nThis year underscored a clear trend: miners repurposing sites for AI data centers which outperformed pure-play bitcoin operators.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Analog Devices, Amazon.com and Fortive\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 26, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nADI\n\n^GSPC\n\nFTV\n\nFor Immediate Releases Chicago, IL &ndash; December 26, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAnalog Devices, Inc. ADI, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Fortive Corp. FTV.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Buy 3 Tech Stocks as Santa Claus Rally Gets Underway The Santa Claus rally appears to have finally taken off, with tech stocks rebounding after a roller-coaster ride over the past month. Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. , Amazon.com, Inc. and Fortive Corp. , which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks with Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc. Analog Devices, Inc. is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.

      "Content": "Returns At Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) Are On The Way Up\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 26, 2025 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nIf you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Tower Semiconductor ( NASDAQ:TSEM ) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Tower Semiconductor, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.057 = US$170m ÷ (US$3.3b - US$269m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025) .\nSo, Tower Semiconductor has an ROCE of 5.7%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Semiconductor industry average of 8.9%.\nView our latest analysis for Tower Semiconductor\nIn the above chart we have measured Tower Semiconductor's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Tower Semiconductor .\nHow Are Returns Trending? We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 5.7%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 73%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\n\nThe Bottom Line A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Tower Semiconductor has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 374% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Tower Semiconductor looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The intrinsic value infographic for TSEM helps visualize whether it is currently trading for a fair price.\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Within this context, Morgan Stanley touched upon the analog chips sector, saying the outlook is slowly improving. In this sector, the firm expressed a preference for NXP Semiconductors N.V.

      "Content": "NXP Semiconductors' (NASDAQ:NXPI) investors will be pleased with their favorable 54% return over the last three years\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 23, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nInvestors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the NXP Semiconductors N.V. ( NASDAQ:NXPI ) share price return of 45% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 6.9% in the last year.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nOver the last three years, NXP Semiconductors failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 6.8% (annualized).\nThus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.\n\nThe modest 1.8% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. You can only imagine how long term shareholders feel about the declining revenue trend (slipping at 2.8% per year). What's clear is that historic earnings and revenue aren't matching up with the share price action, very well. So you might have to dig deeper to get a grasp of the situation\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nNXP Semiconductors is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates .\nWhat About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of NXP Semiconductors, it has a TSR of 54% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory Continues\nA Different Perspective NXP Semiconductors provided a TSR of 8.9% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 10% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - NXP Semiconductors has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "SVP Sells 4,945 Skyworks Solutions Shares Worth $308,000\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nDecember 22, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nKey Points The sale represented about 20% of Robert John Terry's holdings.\nTerry made three open-market sales over the past year.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nOn November 19, 2025, Robert John Terry, SVP, Gen. Counsel & Secretary of Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) , reported the sale of 4,945 shares in multiple open-market transactions, as disclosed in a SEC Form 4 filing .\n\nTransaction summary Metric\nValue\nShares sold\n4,945\nTransaction value\n~$308,000\nPost-transaction shares\n19,824\nPost-transaction value (direct ownership)\n~$1.2 million\n\nTransaction value based on SEC Form 4 weighted average purchase price ($62.28); post-transaction value based on Nov. 19, 2025 market close ($62.28).\nKey questions How significant was this sale relative to Robert John Terry’s direct holdings?\nThis transaction represented 19.96% of Terry’s direct shareholdings immediately prior to the sale, reducing his ownership from 24,769 to 19,824 shares. This is consistent with his median sell size over the past year.\nDoes this sale align with Terry’s historical trading patterns?\nIn the past year, Terry has made three open-market sales, each accounting for a substantial proportion of his remaining capacity, as his direct holdings have declined by 49.2% since November of last year. The current sale matches the recent median of 4,945 shares per trade.\nHow does the transaction value compare to current and historical stock prices?\nThe weighted average sale price was $62.28, just below the market close of $62.59 on November 19, 2025, and 1.2% lower than the current price of $63.05 as of November 24, 2025. Over the preceding twelve months, shares have declined 24.69% on a total return basis.\nWhat is Terry’s remaining exposure to Skyworks Solutions after this transaction?\nPost-transaction, Terry retains direct ownership of 19,824 shares, valued at approximately $1.2 million as of November 19, 2025.\n\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close 11/19/2025)\n$62.59\nMarket capitalization\n$9.31 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$4.09 billion\n1-year price change\n-25.10%\n\n* 1-year price change calculated using November 19, 2025 as the reference date.\nCompany snapshot Offers a broad portfolio of semiconductor products, including amplifiers, filters, front-end modules, and analog system-on-chip solutions.\nGenerates revenue by designing, manufacturing, and selling proprietary semiconductor components to a diversified set of end-markets.\nServes customers across the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, and wearable device markets.\n\nStory Continues\nSkyworks Solutions operates at scale with over 10,000 employees and a global footprint in the semiconductor industry. The company leverages proprietary technology and an extensive product portfolio to address high-growth connectivity and communications markets. Its strategic focus on diversified end-markets and integrated solutions positions Skyworks as a key supplier to leading OEMs and infrastructure providers worldwide.\n\nFoolish take As previously mentioned, Robert John Terry’s sale of Skyworks stock coincides with numerous sales transactions among executives at the company. Although Terry chose to retain a significant number of shares, the size of the transaction relative to his position may point to concerns.\nThe challenge investors face is determining whether the issue is related to the company or the industry in general. The state of the stock may point to the latter. One of its more prominent competitors, Texas Instruments , experienced a similar decline in its stock.\n\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is in the midst of a significant growth phase due to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Even the most advanced of these AI chips needs the RF and connectivity components like the ones Skyworks produces to power the broader ecosystem.\nAdditionally, Skyworks sells at a P/E ratio of 20, around the five-year average for its valuation. That earnings multiple could eventually bode well for attracting new investors to the company as the advancements continue.\nGlossary Form 4: A required SEC filing disclosing insider transactions in a company’s securities.\nOpen-market transaction: The purchase or sale of securities on a public exchange, not through private or pre-arranged deals.\nInsider: A company executive, director, or major shareholder with access to non-public company information.\nDirect ownership: Shares held and controlled directly by an individual, not through trusts or indirect arrangements.\nWeighted average price: The average price of shares sold or bought, weighted by the number of shares at each price.\nMedian sell size: The middle value of all insider sale amounts over a period, used to show typical transaction size.\nTotal return: The investment's price change plus all dividends and distributions, assuming those payouts are reinvested.\nOEM: Original Equipment Manufacturer; a company that produces parts or equipment used in another company’s end products.\nProprietary technology: Technology owned and controlled by a company, often protected by patents or trade secrets.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Wall Street Analysts Think Silicon Motion (SIMO) Is a Good Investment: Is It?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 22, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nThe recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Silicon Motion (SIMO).\n\nSilicon Motion currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.30, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 10 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.30 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 10 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 10% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SIMO Check price target & stock forecast for Silicon Motion here>>>\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Silicon Motion, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs SIMO Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Silicon Motion, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.55.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Silicon Motion. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Silicon Motion.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Is Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 22, 2025 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nKey Insights Cirrus Logic's estimated fair value is US$91.95 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$121 suggests Cirrus Logic is potentially 32% overvalued\nThe US$140 analyst price target for CRUS is 52% more than our estimate of fair value\nDoes the December share price for Cirrus Logic, Inc. ( NASDAQ:CRUS ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model .\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThe Calculation We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$369.8m\nUS$399.5m\nUS$392.3m\nUS$391.6m\nUS$394.9m\nUS$401.1m\nUS$409.4m\nUS$419.3m\nUS$430.6m\nUS$442.9m\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x1\nAnalyst x1\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ -0.19%\nEst @ 0.84%\nEst @ 1.57%\nEst @ 2.08%\nEst @ 2.43%\nEst @ 2.68%\nEst @ 2.85%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11%\nUS$334\nUS$327\nUS$290\nUS$262\nUS$239\nUS$220\nUS$203\nUS$188\nUS$174\nUS$162\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.4b\n\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$443m× (1 + 3.3%) ÷ (11%– 3.3%) = US$6.3b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$6.3b÷ ( 1 + 11%) 10 = US$2.3b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.7b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$121, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nImportant Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cirrus Logic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.581. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Cirrus Logic\nSWOT Analysis for Cirrus Logic Strength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nCurrently debt free.\nWeakness\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nOpportunity\nCRUS' financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nLooking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

(NASDAQ: SWKS ) is one of the 10 Most Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Invest in . On December 11, Thomas O’Kalley of Barclays maintained his Hold rating on Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) stock, along with the price target of $88. This price target remains well above the median price target of $75 and offers 31% upside from the current level.\n\nSWKS has struggled since the announcement of the merger with Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), but the stock has been rallying for the past month, and Barclays’ $88 price target may add further to the bullish sentiment. Investors were possibly spooked by the amount of time it may take for the merger to financially benefit the company. The merger is expected to be executed by early 2027, with about $500 million in cost savings expected by 2028-2029. The cash-and-stock transaction is weighing heavily on the stock, as is the risk of regulatory approval.\nThe regulatory risk stems from the fact that both Skyworks and Qorvo are competitors and significant suppliers for one company: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). A merger would reduce competition in RF components, increasing Apple’s dependence on a single supplier. This reduced competition is generally bad for the end consumer, which is why regulators usually side with companies like Apple in such merger scenarios.\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) specializes in radio-frequency and analog solutions. These products enable wireless connectivity across industrial applications, automotive systems, and smartphones, among other things. It is based in Irvine, California.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

On December 16, Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) and raised the price target from $255 to $265. According to estimates from 34 analysts covering the stock on Wall Street, the stock has a median upside target of $265, exactly where BofA’s price target now stands.\nCantor Fitzgerald Research also made some comments on the semiconductor industry on December 16, expecting relative outperformance from NXPI stock. These two positive analyst responses come at a time when investors are fearing negative sentiment as a result of news coming out of Chandler, where the company’s ECHO fab used to manufacture parts for 5G equipment.\nAccording to an NXP spokesperson who spoke to Business Journal on December 13:\nThe Chandler facility is expected to close by 2027 after a lack of ROI on investments amid lower-than-expected global 5G deployments. The firm will completely exit the radio power market while scaling down operations at the Chandler fab.\nNXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a designer and manufacturer of semiconductor equipment based in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

      "Content": "Is There an Opportunity in STMicroelectronics After Recent Semiconductor Cycle Sentiment Shift?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 20, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: STM\n\nSTMEF\n\nIf you are wondering whether STMicroelectronics is a bargain or a value trap at current levels, this article will walk you through what the numbers really say about the stock.\nThe share price has been volatile, down 0.8% over the last week but still up 14.7% in the past month, even though it remains negative year to date and over the last few years.\nRecent attention around the semiconductor cycle, including renewed interest in automotive and industrial chips and ongoing discussion about supply chain resilience, has helped shift sentiment toward established European chipmakers like STMicroelectronics. Investors are weighing whether these structural demand drivers can offset concerns about cyclicality and global competition.\nRight now, STMicroelectronics scores a 3 out of 6 on our valuation checks. This suggests the market may be underestimating it in a few key areas, but not across the board. We will unpack those methods next and then highlight a potentially more effective way to assess its value by the end of the article.\n\nSTMicroelectronics delivered -5.0% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: STMicroelectronics Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth today by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and discounting those cash flows back to the present.\nFor STMicroelectronics, the latest twelve month free cash flow is negative at around $746 million. This reflects heavy investment and cyclicality in the business rather than mature, steady cash generation. Analysts currently forecast free cash flow to rebound strongly, with projections reaching about $1.83 billion by 2028. Beyond the initial analyst window, Simply Wall St extrapolates cash flows out to ten years using gradually slowing growth assumptions that match a maturing semiconductor business.\n\nWhen these projected cash flows are discounted using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the intrinsic value comes out at roughly €25.84 per share. This implies the stock is about 14.2% undervalued relative to the current market price and suggests investors are not fully pricing in the expected cash flow recovery.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests STMicroelectronics is undervalued by 14.2%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 914 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for STMicroelectronics.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: STMicroelectronics Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like STMicroelectronics, the price to earnings ratio is a useful way to gauge what investors are willing to pay today for each unit of current earnings. In general, faster and more reliable earnings growth, along with lower perceived risk, tends to justify a higher, or more generous, PE multiple. Slower growth or higher uncertainty usually warrants a lower one.\n\nSTMicroelectronics currently trades on about 43.0x earnings, which is above the broader Semiconductor industry average of roughly 34.9x, but below the peer group average of around 56.1x. To move beyond these simple comparisons, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio that estimates what PE the company should trade on after accounting for its earnings growth outlook, profit margins, industry profile, market cap and company specific risks. This tailored benchmark is more robust than relying solely on peer or industry averages, which can be distorted by outliers or different business models.\nFor STMicroelectronics, the Fair Ratio is 45.2x, slightly above the current 43.0x. That points to a modest valuation gap, suggesting the shares look somewhat cheap relative to what its fundamentals imply.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1465 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your STMicroelectronics Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simple, story driven views you create on Simply Wall St’s Community page that connect your assumptions about STMicroelectronics’ future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast, a fair value estimate and ultimately a buy or sell decision. You do this by comparing that fair value to today’s price, updating automatically when fresh news or earnings arrive. One investor who believes STM’s EV, industrial automation and AI design wins will drive faster growth and margin expansion might set a higher fair value around €31. A more cautious investor focused on China competition, inventory risk and FX headwinds might settle closer to €20, with both Narratives living side by side on the platform as dynamic, easy to use guides for their next move.\nDo you think there's more to the story for STMicroelectronics?

      "Content": "Silicon Motion (NasdaqGS:SIMO): Assessing Valuation After Strong Earnings Momentum and Upbeat Growth Expectations\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 18, 2025 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nSilicon Motion Technology (SIMO) has been back on traders screens after a steady run of earnings beats and expectations for roughly 44% year over year profit growth this quarter, even as parts of the chip sector lag.\nSee our latest analysis for Silicon Motion Technology.\nThe stock has been choppy lately, with a 1 day share price return of 2.39% lifting it to 86.56. The standout figure is the roughly 58% year to date share price return and 65.63% one year total shareholder return, signaling that positive earnings momentum is still very much in play.\n\nGiven how SIMO has ridden the semiconductor upcycle, this could be a good moment to see what else is working in chips and hardware via high growth tech and AI stocks .\nYet with the shares still trading well below consensus price targets after such a strong run, investors are left to wonder: is Silicon Motion undervalued on its earnings momentum, or has the market already priced in the next leg of growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 24.1% Undervalued With Silicon Motion Technology closing at 86.56 versus a widely followed fair value of 114, the prevailing narrative leans toward meaningful upside from here.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how this story gets to triple digit fair value? The crux is aggressive profit growth, expanding margins, and a future earnings multiple that assumes real execution. Want to see the exact trajectory behind that conviction and where the narrative thinks growth peaks? Dive into the full breakdown and test those assumptions for yourself.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $114 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, execution missteps on next generation controllers or sharper than expected price competition could quickly undermine the upbeat growth and margin narrative around SIMO.\nFind out about the key risks to this Silicon Motion Technology narrative.\nAnother View: Cash Flows Tell a Different Story While the narrative based on future earnings points to upside, our DCF model is much more cautious, putting fair value closer to 36.82, well below the current 86.56 share price. If cash flows are right and optimism is wrong, how much margin of safety is really left?\n\n繼續閱讀\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out Silicon Motion Technology for example ). We show the entire calculation in full.

      "Content": "Does Silicon Motion Still Offer Value After a 67.4% Surge and AI Storage Hype?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 18, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nWondering if Silicon Motion Technology is still a smart buy after its big run, or if most of the upside is already priced in? Let us unpack what the market might be missing about its value.\nThe stock is up an impressive 58.1% year to date and 67.4% over the last year, even after a recent 7.3% pullback over the past week that hints at some renewed uncertainty and opportunity.\nMuch of the recent move has been driven by optimism around demand for NAND flash controllers and broader AI related storage needs, which has pushed investors to reassess the company’s growth runway. At the same time, shifting sentiment in the semiconductor space and ongoing consolidation talk have added a layer of speculation alongside fundamentals.\nOn our valuation framework, Silicon Motion Technology scores a 3/6 for being undervalued. You can explore this in more detail via its valuation score . Next, we will walk through what different valuation approaches say about the stock, before closing with an even more intuitive way to think about its true worth.\n\nSilicon Motion Technology delivered 67.4% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: Silicon Motion Technology Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a business is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those cash flows back to today in dollar terms.\nFor Silicon Motion Technology, the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model starts from last twelve months free cash flow of about $0.49 million and uses analyst forecasts out to 2027, then extrapolates further. By 2026, free cash flow is projected at roughly $137.93 million, easing to around $121.61 million by 2035 as growth moderates from early analyst expectations to steadier long term levels.\n\nDiscounting this stream of cash flows back to today yields an estimated intrinsic value of about $36.77 per share. Compared with the current share price, this suggests the stock is roughly 135.0% above its DCF based fair value, indicating that recent optimism may already be more than reflected in the price.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Silicon Motion Technology may be overvalued by 135.0%. Discover 918 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Silicon Motion Technology.\nApproach 2: Silicon Motion Technology Price vs Earnings For a consistently profitable business like Silicon Motion Technology, the price to earnings, or PE, ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are paying for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower or more volatile earnings growth tend to pull a fair multiple down.\n\nStory Continues\nSilicon Motion currently trades on a PE of about 30.45x, which is below the broader Semiconductor industry average of roughly 36.11x and well below the peer group average of around 67.38x. On the surface, that discount could suggest the market is still somewhat cautious about the company’s earnings durability and growth profile.\n\nTo move beyond simple comparisons, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary Fair Ratio of 28.37x for Silicon Motion. This reflects its specific mix of earnings growth, margins, size, industry positioning and risk factors. This tailored benchmark is more informative than raw industry or peer averages, which can be skewed by very high growth or speculative names. With the stock’s actual PE sitting modestly above this Fair Ratio, the market appears to be pricing Silicon Motion at a slight premium to what its fundamentals imply.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1455 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Silicon Motion Technology Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, an easy framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that helps you turn your view of Silicon Motion Technology into a clear story. You can link that story to specific revenue, earnings and margin forecasts, and then translate those forecasts into a fair value you can compare to today’s price to decide whether to buy, hold or sell. The system keeps your Narrative dynamically updated as fresh earnings or news arrives. One investor might build a bullish Narrative that sees fair value closer to around $114 per share based on strong AI driven storage demand and margin expansion. Another might create a more cautious Narrative that anchors nearer to about $80 per share due to competitive and geopolitical risks. Both perspectives can coexist transparently, grounded in explicit assumptions rather than vague opinions.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Silicon Motion Technology?

      "Content": "Weak Financial Prospects Seem To Be Dragging Down Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Stock\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 17, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nIt is hard to get excited after looking at Skyworks Solutions' (NASDAQ:SWKS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 11% over the past three months. We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Skyworks Solutions' ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nHow Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Skyworks Solutions is:\n8.3% = US$477m ÷ US$5.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2025).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Skyworks Solutions' Earnings Growth And 8.3% ROE On the face of it, Skyworks Solutions' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 11% either. For this reason, Skyworks Solutions' five year net income decline of 18% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.\nHowever, when we compared Skyworks Solutions' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 5.3% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.\n\nStory Continues\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is SWKS fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Skyworks Solutions Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? Skyworks Solutions' declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 53% (or a retention ratio of 47%). With only very little left to reinvest into the business, growth in earnings is far from likely.\n\nAdditionally, Skyworks Solutions has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 50%. Still, forecasts suggest that Skyworks Solutions' future ROE will rise to 12% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.\nSummary Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Skyworks Solutions. The company has seen a lack of earnings growth as a result of retaining very little profits and whatever little it does retain, is being reinvested at a very low rate of return. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

      "Content": "Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 17, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Silicon Motion falls in, has lost 6.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 points to a change of +3.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.88 indicates a change of +37.5% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Silicon Motion.\n\nLire la suite\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate of $260.55 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +36.3%. The $863.29 million and $1.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.4% and +21.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $242 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.07 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.52%. The EPS surprise was +23.46%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(SWKS) designs, manufactures, and markets a broad range of high-performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors that enable wireless connectivity. With a market cap of $9.8 billion, the company’s operations span the US, Indo-Pacific, and EMEA region.\n\nCompanies worth between $2 billion and $10 billion are generally described as \"mid-cap stocks.\" SWKS fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size and influence in the semiconductor industry.\nMore News from Barchart While AI Panic Struck Applied Digital (APLD) Stock, the Smart Money Has a Different View\nJPMorgan Says to Sell NVDA March $160 Puts.

Sign up now!\nSkyworks touched its 52-week high of $95.46 on Jan. 21 and is currently trading 30.8% below that peak. Meanwhile, SWKS stock has declined 11.1% over the past three months, notably lagging behind the iShares Semiconductor ETF’s (SOXX) 14.6% surge during the same time frame.\nSkyworks’ performance has remained grim over the longer term as well. SWKS stock has plunged 25.6% on a YTD basis and 27.3% over the past 52 weeks, significantly underperforming SOXX’s 37.5% surge in 2025 and 30.2% returns over the past year.\nSWKS stock has traded mostly below its 200-day moving average over the past year, with some notable fluctuations and consistently below its 50-day moving average since early November, underscoring its bearish trend.\nSkyworks Solutions’ stock prices gained more than 2% in the trading session following the release of its impressive Q4 results on Nov. 4. During the quarter, the company secured 5G content across premium Android smartphones, including Google Pixel 10, Samsung Galaxy S25, and others. Further, it also expanded in-vehicle infotainment programs with BYD, Stellantis, and a leading Korean OEM.\n\nMeanwhile, Skyworks reported a notable 7.3% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.1 billion, beating the Street’s expectations by a significant margin. Moreover, SWKS delivered a notable 13.5% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.76, surpassing the consensus estimates by more than 15%.\nNonetheless, Skyworks has also underperformed its peer, Analog Devices, Inc.’s (ADI) 31% surge in 2025 and 28.7% returns over the past 52 weeks.\nAmong the 25 analysts covering the SWKS stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” Its mean price target of $84.56 suggests a 28.1% upside potential from current price levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Sarawgi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Does Qorvo’s 2025 Rebound and 28.2% Surge Justify Its Current Valuation?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 12, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QRVO\n\nWondering if Qorvo at around $89 is quietly becoming a value play or still a risky semiconductor bet? This breakdown is designed to help you decide without the jargon.\nThe stock is up 0.5% over the last week, 3.3% over the past month, and 28.2% year to date, but those gains still sit against a 5 year return of about -44.0%.\nRecently, Qorvo has stayed in the spotlight as investors focus on the long term demand for radio frequency chips in smartphones, 5G infrastructure, and connected devices. In addition, ongoing attention on reshoring and semiconductor supply chains continues to shape how the market prices companies like Qorvo.\nDespite all that interest, Qorvo only scores 1/6 on our valuation checks . We will walk through what different valuation methods are actually saying about the stock, then finish with a more holistic way to think about its real worth.\n\nQorvo scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Qorvo Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a business is worth today by projecting the cash it could generate in the future, then discounting those cash flows back to the present.\nFor Qorvo, the model starts with last twelve months free cash flow of about $539 million. Analysts provide detailed forecasts for the next few years, and beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates further out to build a 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Under these assumptions, Qorvo’s free cash flow is projected to rise to around $730 million by 2035, still in dollar terms.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the intrinsic value is estimated at roughly $74.31 per share. With the stock trading near $89, the DCF output implies Qorvo is about 20.3% overvalued on this cash flow outlook.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Qorvo may be overvalued by 20.3%. Discover 903 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Qorvo.\nApproach 2: Qorvo Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Qorvo, the price to earnings (PE) ratio is a useful shorthand for how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster earnings growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tend to pull that multiple down.\n\nQorvo currently trades on a PE of about 38.0x, which is roughly in line with the broader Semiconductor industry average of around 38.0x, but above the peer group average near 34.5x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio of 29.1x for Qorvo, which represents the PE you might expect given its specific mix of earnings growth, margins, industry positioning, market cap and risk profile.\n\nLeer más\nThis Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or sector averages because it adjusts for Qorvo’s own fundamentals rather than assuming it deserves the same multiple as every other chip company. With the shares at 38.0x versus a Fair Ratio of 29.1x, the multiple based view suggests Qorvo is trading at a premium to what its fundamentals currently justify.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1447 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Qorvo Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This is a simple framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you tell the story behind your numbers by linking your view of Qorvo’s future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast, a fair value estimate and a clear buy or sell signal. That fair value is compared to today’s price and then dynamically updated when new information, like merger news or earnings, comes in. For example, a bullish investor might build a Narrative that leans into 5G, 6G and merger synergies to justify a fair value closer to the high end of recent targets near $128. A more cautious investor could emphasize customer concentration, regulatory risk and handset cyclicality to land nearer the low end around $70. Both perspectives can coexist on the platform as approachable, side by side stories that may make it easier to decide whether Qorvo at about $89 appears attractively priced, fully valued, or too expensive for a given personal outlook.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Qorvo?

      "Content": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Cirrus Logic (CRUS) is a Great Choice\n\nZacks Equity Research\nDecember 10, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nMomentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the \"long context,\" investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Cirrus Logic (CRUS) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Cirrus Logic currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market? Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CRUS that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor CRUS, shares are up 2.89% over the past week while the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry is up 4.96% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.11% compares favorably with the industry's 4.17% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Cirrus Logic have increased 5.57% over the past quarter, and have gained 18.64% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.34% and 14.25%, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors should also pay attention to CRUS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CRUS is currently averaging 478,999 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CRUS.\nOver the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CRUS's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.07 to $7.73 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CRUS is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B.

      "Content": "Is It Too Late To Consider Tower Semiconductor After Its 140% 2025 Rally?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 9, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\nIf you are wondering whether Tower Semiconductor is still a smart buy after such a huge run up in its share price, or if you might be late to the party, this article will break down what the current valuation is actually telling us.\nThe stock has surged recently, climbing 6.5% over the last week, 47.5% over the past month, and an eye catching 140.5% year to date, while delivering a 384.0% gain over 5 years.\nThose moves have been driven by growing investor enthusiasm around analog and specialty semiconductor demand, as well as Tower's strategic positioning as a foundry partner for companies that want alternatives to the largest chip manufacturers. At the same time, shifting expectations about industry consolidation and long term chip demand cycles have added a layer of both excitement and volatility to the story.\nDespite that performance, Tower Semiconductor currently scores just 0/6 on our undervaluation checks. In this article we will walk through what different valuation approaches say about the stock today, and then wrap up by looking at a more holistic way to think about its overall worth.\n\nTower Semiconductor scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Tower Semiconductor Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a business is worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back into today’s dollars using a required rate of return.\nFor Tower Semiconductor, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company is currently generating negative free cash flow of about $25.1 Million, but analysts and extrapolations see this swinging to positive territory and then scaling materially. Projections point to free cash flow reaching roughly $34.3 Million in 2026 and climbing to about $1.43 Billion by 2035, all in $ terms. Simply Wall St only uses direct analyst estimates for the early years, then extrapolates further growth based on recent trends.\n\nAfter discounting this stream of future cash flows, the DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of around $63.19 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies the stock is about 96.2% overvalued.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Tower Semiconductor may be overvalued by 96.2%. Discover 903 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Tower Semiconductor.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: Tower Semiconductor Price vs Earnings For a profitable business like Tower Semiconductor, the price to earnings (PE) ratio is a useful way to see how much investors are willing to pay today for each dollar of current earnings. It ties directly to what the company is actually making now, which makes it more intuitive than cash flow models for many investors.\n\nWhat counts as a “normal” PE depends on how quickly earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher growth and lower perceived risk usually justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tend to hold the PE down.\nTower currently trades on a PE of 71.2x, which is well above both the Semiconductor industry average of 38.0x and the average of its peers at 44.5x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 45.6x, which is the PE you might expect once you factor in Tower’s specific mix of earnings growth, profitability, industry, market cap and risk profile. Because this Fair Ratio is tailored to Tower, it is more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry.\nWith the current PE of 71.2x sitting materially above the 45.6x Fair Ratio, the shares look expensive on this metric.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1450 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Tower Semiconductor Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple framework on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you turn your view of a company into a story tied to a financial forecast and a fair value. You can compare that fair value with the current price and decide when to buy or sell. You can also track how it updates automatically as new news or earnings arrive, and even see how different investors can look at the same Tower Semiconductor data and reach very different conclusions. For example, one Narrative might lean bullish, assuming accelerating RF Infrastructure and Silicon Photonics growth that justifies a fair value closer to $124 or even $135. A more cautious Narrative might focus on capital intensity, execution and concentration risks and land nearer the low $59 to $60 range. Both perspectives use the same building blocks of future revenues, margins and multiples, just arranged into different, clearly explained stories behind the numbers.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Tower Semiconductor?

The full narrative unpacks the bold forecasts behind that fair value and why 2027 could be a turning point for Tower’s earnings mix.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $124 (ABOUT RIGHT)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, execution missteps on Tower’s heavy CapEx buildout, or a faster than expected shift in optical transceiver technologies, could quickly challenge today’s optimistic assumptions.\nFind out about the key risks to this Tower Semiconductor narrative.\nBuild Your Own Tower Semiconductor Narrative If the consensus story does not fully resonate or you prefer to dig into the numbers yourself, you can build a custom view in minutes, Do it your way .\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 1 key reward investors are optimistic about regarding Tower Semiconductor.\nLooking for your next investing edge?

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nCirrus Logic Introduces New Family of Advanced Closed-Loop Haptic Drivers for Next-Generation Automotive Interfaces\n\nBusiness Wire\nDecember 9, 2025 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nAutomotive-qualified solutions for more intuitive, immersive in-vehicle experiences\nAUSTIN, Texas, December 09, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS), a leading provider of high-performance audio and mixed-signal semiconductor solutions, today announced the launch of its new family of closed-loop haptic drivers CS40L51, CS40L52 and CS40L53, marking the company’s first haptic driver solutions reliability qualified in accordance with the AEC-Q100 automotive standard. The new family of products brings Cirrus Logic’s proven expertise in consumer and smartphone haptics to the automotive space, enabling a more consistent, immersive and intuitive tactile user experience across a wide range of in-cabin interfaces.\n\nAs automakers look to elevate and differentiate vehicles with personalized, immersive experiences, haptics-enabled smart surfaces play a critical role in enabling premium interior designs that are sleek, modern and sustainable. Cirrus Logic’s closed-loop technology improves actuator response, creates a wider range of haptics effects and delivers consistent performance across varying conditions. This ensures high-definition haptic feedback on interactive displays, steering wheels, smart surfaces, center consoles, smart seats and more.\n\"Consumers expect a high level of responsiveness from haptics experiences. Early adoption of haptics in vehicles was not intuitive or consistently reliable, and didn’t deliver a realistic tactile experience,\" said Vlad Bulavsky, Director, Automotive Solutions, Cirrus Logic. \"Cirrus Logic’s new low latency, closed-loop haptics technology addresses this challenge for automotive designers who are redefining how we interact with our cars and take user experience to the next level.\"\n\n\"As screens replace physical controls in vehicles, the industry has recognized the need for sophisticated tactile feedback to bridge the gap,\" said Peter Cooney, Chief Technology Analyst at DATAportl, a leading market research provider. \"We are moving past basic vibration to advanced, high-definition haptics that simulate physical textures and clicks. This shift is essential for reducing distraction and is the primary force driving the automotive haptics market today.\"\nCirrus Logic’s CS40L51/52/53 family offers a range of features satisfying different use cases and budgets. It simplifies the design process for engineers by integrating key components into an efficient solution. The drivers’ advanced closed-loop hardware and algorithm improve the response time of the actuator and expand usable frequency bandwidth to create a wider range of haptic effects. These new haptics solutions support a broader range of tactile effects and enable new and better ways to leverage haptics for automotive user experiences.\n\nStory Continues\nCS40L51 – Combines advanced Sensor-less Velocity Control (SVC), real-time audio to haptics synchronization (A2H) and active vibration compensation (AVC) for immersive, high-fidelity feedback.\nCS40L52 – Features the advanced closed-loop control SVC that optimizes the system's haptic performance in real-time by reducing response time, increasing frequency bandwidth and compensating for manufacturing tolerances and temperature variation.\n\nCS40L53 – Features the Click Compensation algorithm to enable consistent haptic feedback across systems by adjusting haptic effects based on the actuator manufacturing characteristics.\nBy leveraging Cirrus Logic’s deep expertise in signal processing and consumer electronics, the CS40L51/52/53 drivers provide automotive designers with a scalable platform for both current and future generations of haptic-enabled automotive solutions.\nKey Benefits\nConsistent haptics performance across manufacturing and temperature variation through advance closed-loop algorithms\nWider frequency range of haptics feedback compared to a conventional system enabling new user experiences and textured effects\nIntuitive high-definition haptics feedback enabled by the advanced closed-loop algorithm which improves the actuator response time\nHaptics tools that simplify waveform design to accelerate development cycles\nReliability qualified in accordance with the AEC Q100 standard to support a wide range of automotive applications\n\nAvailability\nEngineering samples of CS40L51, CS40L52 and CS40L53 are available now, with mass production expected to begin in December 2025. Additional product details, including data sheets and application materials, are available at www.cirrus.com/automotive-haptics .\nAbout Cirrus Logic\nCirrus Logic is a leading supplier of innovative analog, mixed-signal, and audio DSP solutions that enable compelling user experiences in mobile, consumer, and automotive applications.

      "Content": "Has Cirrus Logic’s 24.6% 2025 Rally Already Priced In Future Growth?\n\nSimply Wall St\nDecember 7, 2025 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nWondering if Cirrus Logic is still a smart buy at today’s price, or if most of the upside has already been captured? This breakdown will walk through what the current market is really pricing in.\nThe stock has quietly climbed to around $123.82, delivering gains of 2.9% over the last week, 4.4% over the past month, and a strong 24.6% year to date. This hints that investors are warming up to its story after a 61.1% rise over three years.\nRecently, Cirrus Logic has been in focus for its role as a key audio and signal processing supplier within major consumer devices, with investors watching closely for design wins and product refresh cycles that can drive future unit demand. In addition, the broader semiconductor space has been reassessed as a potential long term growth engine, which has helped underpin sentiment around niche, high margin chip makers like Cirrus.\nDespite this, Cirrus Logic only scores 2 out of 6 on our valuation checks, suggesting the market may already be pricing in a fair chunk of good news. We will walk through different valuation approaches next and then finish with a more nuanced way to think about what the stock is truly worth.\n\nCirrus Logic scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Cirrus Logic Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A discounted cash flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and discounting those dollars back to today. For Cirrus Logic, the model uses a 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, starting from last twelve months free cash flow of about $524.8 million and then applying growth assumptions over time.\n\nAnalyst forecasts and extrapolated estimates see free cash flow easing to around $369.8 million in 2026 and then gradually rising, reaching roughly $442.9 million by 2035, all in $. Simply Wall St discounts these projected cash flows to arrive at an intrinsic value of about $92.58 per share.\nWith the stock trading around $123.82, the DCF suggests Cirrus Logic is roughly 33.7% overvalued on this methodology, implying that a lot of future optimism is already reflected in the price.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Cirrus Logic may be overvalued by 33.7%. Discover 908 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Cirrus Logic.\nApproach 2: Cirrus Logic Price vs Earnings For a profitable, established business like Cirrus Logic, the price to earnings ratio is a practical way to gauge valuation because it directly links what investors pay today to the profits the company is generating right now. In general, faster growth and lower risk can justify a higher PE multiple, while slower growth or more uncertainty typically warrant a lower one.\n\nStory Continues\nCirrus Logic currently trades on a PE of about 16.6x, which sits well below the broader Semiconductor industry average of roughly 38.0x and also beneath a peer group average of about 29.6x. On the surface, that discount might suggest the stock is attractively priced, but simple peer comparisons do not fully reflect Cirrus Logic’s specific growth outlook, margins, size and risk profile.\n\nTo address this, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary Fair Ratio, which estimates what a reasonable PE should be after accounting for factors such as expected earnings growth, profitability, industry characteristics, market cap and company specific risks. For Cirrus Logic, that Fair Ratio is calculated at around 15.5x, only slightly below the current 16.6x. This points to the market valuing the stock a little above its modelled fair level, but not by a wide margin.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1452 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Cirrus Logic Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to connect your view of Cirrus Logic’s business to concrete numbers like future revenue, earnings, margins and fair value. A Narrative on Simply Wall St is your story about the company, translated into a financial forecast and then into a fair value that you can directly compare with today’s share price to inform whether you might buy, hold, or sell. Narratives are easy to use and live inside the Community page on Simply Wall St’s platform, where millions of investors share and refine their views, and each Narrative automatically updates when new information, such as earnings or major news, is released. For Cirrus Logic, one investor might build a more optimistic Narrative that assumes strong AI driven laptop demand and diversification into automotive could justify a fair value closer to $140, while a more cautious investor might focus on smartphone concentration risks and cyclical demand and arrive at a fair value nearer $90. This provides a clear framework for what you believe and what you are willing to pay.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Cirrus Logic?
