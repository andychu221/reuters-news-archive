      "Content": "Seamless AI Integration Drives Efficiency, Accuracy, and Revenue for Radiology Groups\n\nPHILLIPSBURG, N.J. and SEOUL, South Korea , Feb. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- As the global medical AI market shifts from simple algorithm accuracy to integrated operational infrastructure, Coreline Soft has teamed up with INFINITT North America to bridge the gap between advanced technology and daily clinical practice.\n\nThe partnership has successfully deployed a fully automated, \" zero-click \" AI reading solution now live in U.S. radiology practices. This deep-embed integration allows radiologists to access AI-powered insights directly within their familiar INFINITT PACS environment—eliminating the need for extra clicks, new logins, or workflow interruptions. \" AVIEW has become an essential tool for lung CT and calcium scoring interpretation,\" said Clay Hinrichs, President of ImageCare Radiology, the first U.S. site to adopt the solution. \"We were able to roll it out across our network in just one month, and our team immediately saw benefits in both speed and accuracy.\"\n\nBy embedding Coreline's AVIEW AI platform directly into the INFINITT PACS, the integration automates coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, enhances lung nodule detection, and reduces case reading times. For high-volume radiology groups—processing over 6,000 cases per quarter—the platform has not only improved clinical sensitivity but also driven increased follow-up exams, translating directly into measurable revenue growth and return on investment.\n\nTo further support the U.S. market, Coreline Soft has launched the INFINITT Integration Suite: a dedicated package for INFINITT users that enables rapid deployment of AI modules, supports CPT-based reimbursement, and delivers a truly hands-free experience for clinicians. The suite eliminates manual steps, letting radiologists focus on patient care while AI works in the background.\n\nExperience the Future of Thoracic AI at STR 2026\nAt the upcoming Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR) 2026 annual meeting, Coreline Soft will showcase its clinically optimized chest AI portfolio. Leading the lineup is AVIEW LCS , a solution that has redefined the 'First Reader' role in lung cancer screening. Attendees can also explore AVIEW Lung Texture for ILD and AVIEW COPD , with a focus on Opportunistic Screening —simultaneously assessing lung cancer, COPD, and cardiovascular risk from a single low-dose CT scan.\n\nFor more information or to schedule a demo during STR 2026, please visit www.corelinesoft.com .\n\nView original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coreline-soft-and-infinitt-north-america-deliver-true-zero-click-ai-workflow-to-us-radiology-practices-302688199.html",

      "Content": "A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that took effect early Saturday impacts the agency responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports across the country. Travelers with airline reservations may be nervously recalling a 43-day government shutdown that led to historic flight cancellations and long delays last year.\n\nTransportation Security Administration officers are expected to work without pay while lawmakers remain without an agreement on Homeland Security's annual funding.

      "Content": "Phase 3 NATiV3 fully enrolled: Inventiva says the registrational cohort (1,009 patients randomized 1:1:1 plus ~400 exploratory patients) is in data cleaning ahead of database lock, with top-line lanifibranor results expected in H2 .\n\nPositioning and efficacy: Lanifibranor is a pan‑PPAR oral candidate intended as an add‑on to GLP‑1s for F2/F3 MASH (addressable U.S. F2/F3 population ~ 375,000 ), and Phase 2b showed fibrosis and HbA1c benefits that management says could be particularly valuable in F3 and diabetic patients.\n\nSafety and commercialization preparedness: Management characterizes weight gain as a tolerability issue (≈30% ≥5% weight gain) that can be mitigated by SGLT2 combination, and says the company is positioned to self‑launch with cash runway to Q3 2027 assuming positive data and a €118M financing tranche.\n\nInterested in Inventiva S.A. Sponsored ADR? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nInventiva (NASDAQ:IVA) CEO Andrew Obenshain said the company is preparing for a second-half phase 3 readout for lanifibranor in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), describing the trial as fully enrolled and in the process of data cleaning ahead of database lock and top-line results.\n\nObenshain said the MASH field has “evolved tremendously” in recent years after a history of clinical failures, citing two approvals, multiple acquisitions, and what he described as validation of commercial potential. He pointed to Madrigal’s work as evidence the fibrosis stage 2 and stage 3 (F2/F3) segment could represent a “billion-dollar market.”\n\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nHe also outlined how Inventiva has changed over roughly the past 18 months, beginning with an October 2024 recapitalization intended to extend cash runway. Obenshain credited board chair Mark Pruzanski—identified as former CEO of Intercept and a longtime MASH executive—with helping recruit a clinical management team and adding experienced leadership in R&D and regulatory. Obenshain said his own focus as CEO has been fundraising as well as commercial and general and administrative functions.\n\n“People and money are what actually makes a biotech hum,” he said, adding that the company now has the team and capital needed to execute the phase 3 program and prepare for potential regulatory filing.\n\n→ Is Albemarle Setting Up for a Lithium-Fueled Rebound?\n\nLanifibranor is a pan-PPAR agonist being studied for F2 and F3 patients. Obenshain argued the drug could fit as an oral therapy added on top of GLP-1 drugs, which he expects to be a common “backbone” treatment in MASH.\n\nOn market sizing, he said there are more than 15 million patients with MASH in the U.S., and that diagnosis rates are rising with new product launches and increasing awareness. He said the current addressable F2/F3 population is approximately 375,000 patients. He described a segmentation framework based on fibrosis stage (F2 vs. F3) and diabetes status (around 40% non-diabetic and 60% diabetic), forming “a nice two-by-two grid” with roughly equal patient counts in each segment.\n\n→ Cloudflare: Another AI-Disrupted Stock You Might Want to Buy\n\nObenshain suggested lanifibranor may be particularly attractive for F3 patients due to the clinical focus on preventing progression to cirrhosis (F4) and because, in his words, physicians may choose the “biggest hammer” against fibrosis in that setting. He compared lanifibranor’s phase 2b fibrosis effect size (18% after six months versus placebo) with resmetirom’s (which he said showed a 12% effect size after 12 months). He also said lanifibranor has shown an ability to reduce HbA1c, which he believes may make it more compelling for patients with diabetes.\n\nHe added that resmetirom and lanifibranor could be closer substitutes in F2 non-diabetic patients, where tolerability considerations such as weight gain may influence patient and physician preferences.\n\nObenshain said the phase 3 NATiV3 trial is randomized 1:1:1 across placebo, 800 mg daily, and 1,200 mg daily dosing arms, with 1,009 patients in the main registrational cohort. Patients are treated for 18 months, with liver biopsies at baseline and at the end of treatment, along with noninvasive tests (NITs) during the study.\n\nHe also described an additional blinded exploratory cohort for patients who screen-failed the biopsy criteria for the registrational population—those found to have F1 or F4 instead of F2 or F3. Inventiva has enrolled about 400 patients in that group, he said, with the majority being F1 and roughly 100 being F4. He said data from F1 and F4 patients could help inform a future outcomes trial, with F4 positioned as a likely next development direction.\n\nOn retention, Obenshain said the trial was powered conservatively with an assumption that dropout rates could be as high as 30% given the longer 18-month duration versus earlier studies. He said the company previously disclosed it was below the 30% threshold required for a financing tranche, without providing a specific figure, and that the trial remains “well within the power” assumptions.\n\nObenshain said Inventiva’s phase 2b study had a different primary endpoint (SAF score), but it also measured fibrosis and steatosis outcomes that are central to phase 3. He said NATiV3’s primary endpoint is a dual requirement: improvement in fibrosis stage and improvement in steatosis (fatty liver), which he described as a more difficult hurdle and potentially less vulnerable to placebo effects. He stated the dual endpoint effect size in phase 2b was 24%, while fibrosis alone was 18%, and said phase 3 powering was done more conservatively than those phase 2b results.\n\nHe highlighted several differences between phase 2 and phase 3 populations:\n\nFibrosis stages: Phase 2 included F1 patients, while phase 3 excludes them; Obenshain said removing F1 patients made effect sizes “the same to slightly better.”\n\nDiabetes prevalence: Phase 3 includes more patients with diabetes, which he attributed to U.S.-based enrollment; he said efficacy in patients with diabetes was “the same to slightly better.”\n\nGLP-1 use: GLP-1 drugs were not available during phase 2; in phase 3, about 14% of patients entered on a stable GLP-1 dose, which he said should be balanced across arms.\n\nHe added that patients were allowed to add GLP-1s or SGLT2s during the study, but not at higher “MASH dose” levels; rather, the permitted doses were intended for diabetes control. He said a “mid-single digit” percentage of patients added GLP-1 therapy during the study.\n\nAddressing historical concerns around PPAR drugs, Obenshain said lanifibranor is a novel chemical entity and not based on the thiazolidinedione (TZD) backbone. He described it as rationally designed using lessons from prior PPAR programs, including seeking more modest PPAR-gamma binding (which he compared to pioglitazone rather than rosiglitazone) while also engaging PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta.\n\nOn weight gain, he said about 50% of patients experienced no weight gain, 20% had under 5% weight gain, and 30% had 5% or more. He said the weight gain tends to rise and plateau after about six months, and described early volume expansion followed by changes in fat distribution and muscle effects as contributing factors. He also said Inventiva conducted a study combining lanifibranor with an SGLT2 inhibitor, which he said mitigated weight gain completely.\n\nHe characterized weight gain as more of a tolerability than a safety issue, noting that while about 30% of phase 2 patients gained weight, it was reported as an adverse event in only “low double digits” as a percentage, suggesting many physicians did not view it as an adverse event.\n\nLooking ahead, Obenshain said GLP-1 combinations make sense and suggested an all-oral regimen pairing an oral GLP-1 with lanifibranor could be attractive. He noted that resmetirom has been used alongside GLP-1s, citing a figure he said was about 50% based on public comments.\n\nOn strategic interest, he said some pharma executives have been “burned by PPAR” historically, but that he believes phase 3 data should address those concerns if positive.\n\nOn funding, Obenshain said Inventiva is “structuring ourselves to be able to launch this ourselves.” He said the company has cash runway to Q3 2027, assuming positive data and receipt of a third financing tranche of EUR 118 million, and that the additional runway would provide flexibility to determine next steps, including potential fundraising to support NDA approval and commercialization.\n\nInventiva (NASDAQ: IVA) is a clinical‐stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule therapies for the treatment of metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases. The company's core expertise lies in the modulation of nuclear receptors and signaling pathways that regulate fibrosis, inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Inventiva's scientific platform integrates medicinal chemistry, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, and translational sciences to advance a diversified pipeline of therapeutic candidates.\n\nThe company's lead asset, lanifibranor (IVA337), is a pan-PPAR agonist in Phase III development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nThe article \" Inventiva CEO: Phase 3 Lanifibranor MASH Trial Fully Enrolled, Top-Line Data Due in H2 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

He stated the dual endpoint effect size in phase 2b was 24%, while fibrosis alone was 18%, and said phase 3 powering was done more conservatively than those phase 2b results.\n\nHe highlighted several differences between phase 2 and phase 3 populations:\n\nFibrosis stages: Phase 2 included F1 patients, while phase 3 excludes them; Obenshain said removing F1 patients made effect sizes “the same to slightly better.”\n\nDiabetes prevalence: Phase 3 includes more patients with diabetes, which he attributed to U.S.-based enrollment; he said efficacy in patients with diabetes was “the same to slightly better.”\n\nGLP-1 use: GLP-1 drugs were not available during phase 2; in phase 3, about 14% of patients entered on a stable GLP-1 dose, which he said should be balanced across arms.\n\nHe added that patients were allowed to add GLP-1s or SGLT2s during the study, but not at higher “MASH dose” levels; rather, the permitted doses were intended for diabetes control. He said a “mid-single digit” percentage of patients added GLP-1 therapy during the study.\n\nAddressing historical concerns around PPAR drugs, Obenshain said lanifibranor is a novel chemical entity and not based on the thiazolidinedione (TZD) backbone. He described it as rationally designed using lessons from prior PPAR programs, including seeking more modest PPAR-gamma binding (which he compared to pioglitazone rather than rosiglitazone) while also engaging PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta.\n\nOn weight gain, he said about 50% of patients experienced no weight gain, 20% had under 5% weight gain, and 30% had 5% or more. He said the weight gain tends to rise and plateau after about six months, and described early volume expansion followed by changes in fat distribution and muscle effects as contributing factors. He also said Inventiva conducted a study combining lanifibranor with an SGLT2 inhibitor, which he said mitigated weight gain completely.\n\nHe characterized weight gain as more of a tolerability than a safety issue, noting that while about 30% of phase 2 patients gained weight, it was reported as an adverse event in only “low double digits” as a percentage, suggesting many physicians did not view it as an adverse event.\n\nLooking ahead, Obenshain said GLP-1 combinations make sense and suggested an all-oral regimen pairing an oral GLP-1 with lanifibranor could be attractive. He noted that resmetirom has been used alongside GLP-1s, citing a figure he said was about 50% based on public comments.\n\nOn strategic interest, he said some pharma executives have been “burned by PPAR” historically, but that he believes phase 3 data should address those concerns if positive.\n\nOn funding, Obenshain said Inventiva is “structuring ourselves to be able to launch this ourselves.” He said the company has cash runway to Q3 2027, assuming positive data and receipt of a third financing tranche of EUR 118 million, and that the additional runway would provide flexibility to determine next steps, including potential fundraising to support NDA approval and commercialization.\n\nInventiva (NASDAQ: IVA) is a clinical‐stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule therapies for the treatment of metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases. The company's core expertise lies in the modulation of nuclear receptors and signaling pathways that regulate fibrosis, inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Inventiva's scientific platform integrates medicinal chemistry, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, and translational sciences to advance a diversified pipeline of therapeutic candidates.\n\nThe company's lead asset, lanifibranor (IVA337), is a pan-PPAR agonist in Phase III development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nThe article \" Inventiva CEO: Phase 3 Lanifibranor MASH Trial Fully Enrolled, Top-Line Data Due in H2 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "A federal law requiring impairment-detection devices inside all new cars survived a recent push to strip its funding but remains stalled by questions about whether the technology is ready.\n\nRana Abbas Taylor lost her sister, brother-in-law, nephew and two nieces when a driver with a blood-alcohol level almost four times the legal limit slammed into their car in January 2019 as the Michigan family drove through Lexington, Kentucky, on the way home from a Florida vacation.\n\nThe tragedy turned Abbas Taylor into an outspoken advocate for stopping the more than 10,000 alcohol-related deaths each year on U.S. roads. Lawmakers attached the Honoring Abbas Family Legacy to Terminate Drunk Driving Act to the $1 trillion infrastructure law that then-President Joe Biden signed in 2021.\n\nThe measure, often referred to as the Halt Drunk Driving Act, anticipated that as early as this year, auto companies would be required to roll out technology to “passively” detect when drivers are drunk or impaired and prevent their cars from operating. Regulators can choose from a range of options, including air monitors that sample the car's interior for traces of alcohol, fingertip readers that measure a driver's blood-alcohol level, or scanners that detect signs of impairment in eye or head movements.\n\nMothers Against Drunk Driving called it the most important piece of legislation in the organization's 45-year history. Still, implementation has been bogged down by regulatory delays, without any clear signals that final approval is near.\n\n“The way we measure time is not by days or months or years. It’s by number of lives lost,” Abbas Taylor said in an interview with The Associated Press. “So when we hear manufacturers say, ‘We need more time,’ or ‘The tech is not ready,’ or ‘We’re not there yet,' all we hear is, ‘More people need to die before we’re willing to fix this.’”\n\nA Republican-led effort to remove the Halt Act's funding was defeated in the U.S. House last month by a 268-164 vote. Another bill to repeal it entirely awaits a committee vote.\n\nMost of the opposition has stemmed from suggestions that the law would require manufacturers to equip cars with a “kill switch\". That would essentially allow them to “be controlled by the government,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on the social platform X, drawing comparisons to George Orwell's dystopian novel “1984.”\n\nThe alcohol industry has fiercely defended the law against such arguments. Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said it specifically requires the technology to be passive, similar to other current safety mandates such as seat belts and air bags.\n\n“There is no switch, there’s no government control, there is no sharing of data,\" he said. “That’s just an unfortunate scare tactic.”\n\nBut Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who authored the defunding effort, said even the dashboard acting on its own could serve as “your judge, your jury, and your executioner.\" He cited the example of a mother who swerves in a snowstorm to avoid hitting a neighbor's pet, only for her car to deactivate itself because it determines she's impaired.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association for U.S. automakers, made a similar case to regulators in 2024, arguing that much more research was needed before mandating the technology.\n\n“Even if 1 in 10,000 trips were expected to experience a false positive, this could result in thousands of unimpaired drivers encountering problems that prevent them from driving each day,” the Alliance wrote.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is establishing the rules to implement the Halt Act, told the AP in an email that it's still “assessing developing technologies for potential deployment” and expects to report back to Congress soon. Even supporters predict the agency will push the decision at least into 2027, and auto companies still would have another two to three years to install it.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, recently announced that impairment detection and other technology aimed at curbing risky driving behavior would soon be included as criteria for a vehicle to earn one of its top safety awards.\n\nMany states already have laws requiring breath-activated ignition interlock systems to be installed on the cars of DUI offenders. The system ultimately chosen under the Halt Act is intended to detect impairment beyond just drunk driving.\n\n“We’re still sort of pushing back against this narrative that the technology doesn’t exist,” said Stephanie Manning, chief government affairs officer at MADD. “We’ve seen many different types of technology that can solve drunk driving. We just haven’t seen it deployed and implemented the way that we would like.”\n\nTo accelerate the timeline, one bill advancing in Congress would offer a $45 million prize to whoever can produce and deploy the first consumer-ready piece of technology. Abbas Taylor, whose family members were killed in the Kentucky crash, said efforts like that give her hope.\n\n“When you've lost everything, there is nothing that will stop you from fighting for what is right,” she said. “But we see the writing on the wall, and we know it’s only a matter of time before this happens.”",

The 139th Canton Fair Germany Promotion Conference will, for the first time, focus on targeted industry promotion rather than general introduction. Based on local market demand and future industrial trends, the conference will highlight three traditional categories, including vehicles & two-wheelers, health & recreation and gifts & decorations, as well as three emerging sectors including service robots, drones, and intelligent healthcare. This approach aims to help German buyers gain early insights into key exhibitors and products, enabling more efficient sourcing plans.\n\nIn Morocco, where trade with China has expanded steadily in recent years and number of buyers attending the Canton Fair has increased by over 26% for the past five sessions, the Casablanca conference will follow a similarly approach by spotlighting electronics & appliances, fashion, gifts & decorations, alongside the same group of three emerging industries. By focusing on Morocco's role as a gateway to North African markets, the conference aims to support more practical and market-oriented trade connections.\n\nBesides, both conferences will showcase Canton Fair's latest service upgrades, including its digital platforms and smart tools such as the Canton Fair App, the ASK ME intelligent assistant, and booth-level navigation services. These innovations are designed to streamline attendance procedures, improve information access, and enhance overall sourcing experience.\n\nTo enhance accessibility, both conferences will adopt an online-and-offline integrated format.

      "Content": "A few big names dominate tech stock headlines. This is rightfully so, but there are other tech companies worthy of investors' time and money.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is absolutely one. What was once a standard networking and software company is now a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) custom chip builder partnering with the world's top hyperscalers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nWhat separates Broadcom from the pack is its strong financial profile. The company's solid free cash flow, currently standing at $7.4 billion, has enabled it to pay dividends consistently while continuing to invest in growth. Recent earnings reinforce the narrative that Broadcom is a powerhouse .\n\nIn its fourth-quarter 2025 report, Broadcom's revenues grew 28% year over year, and free cash flow was up 36%. Even if growth slows slightly in the coming quarters, Broadcom's robust balance sheet has given it a true economic moat. The company also announced a 10% increase in its dividend in its latest earnings.\n\nBroadcom's stock is somewhat volatile, but historically patient Broadcom investors have been rewarded . As of Feb. 11, the stock has risen 45% over the past 12 months and an astounding 615% over the past five years. Broadcom's market cap has exploded to more than $1 trillion in this time as well, making it one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nWhat's most impressive about Broadcom is its ability to execute and deliver. Broadcom's $162 billion backlog should ensure it has room to run for the next decade.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount.\n\nPerformance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results.\n\nPerformance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal.\n\nSources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2026 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates no portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.\n\nAll data is as of January 31, 2026 unless otherwise noted.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260213409387/en/\n\nContacts\n\nLiberty All-Star® Growth Fund, Inc.\n1-800-241-1850\nwww.all-starfunds.com\nlibinfo@alpsinc.com",

Just going back to DeepSeek, you know, Broadcom was down 15% and ended up 102. Google was down 18, ended up 100. In these periods, it's very difficult to step in. And so the Nasdaq is getting punished. But we don't think the technology trade's over. And frankly, without technology, it's going to be very hard for the market to go up in any sustainable fashion.” Shares of Nvidia and Apple, both down more than 2%, were the biggest drags on the S&P 500. Shares of Applied Materials provided the strongest boost, jumping more than 8% after the chipmaking-equipment firm forecast second-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street expectations. And shares of networking equipment provider Arista Networks gained nearly 5% after forecasting annual revenue above expectations. Meanwhile, the latest inflation data showed U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in January. Traders now put the chances of an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in June at more than 50%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.",

      "Content": "When markets are up, we feel like geniuses. But when they turn volatile, investors often ask a different question: “What keeps paying me no matter what?” Having a stable income suddenly feels more valuable and can make the sting of volatility hurt a little less. I’m talking about the kind of income that shows up quarter after quarter, even when headlines turn negative and stock prices swing.\n\nThat is where companies on the Dividend Aristocrats list stands out. These are S&P 500 companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. They have managed not only to pay but also to increase shareholder payouts.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nInvestors in Search of Alpha Are Fleeing Tech Stocks for These 3 High-Yield Sectors Instead\n\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nToday, I’m screening my Dividend Aristocrats list, which are not only consistent dividend payers but also still growing earnings and cash flow, supported by solid analyst coverage.\n\nUsing Barchart’s Stock Screener, I selected the following filters to get my list:\n\nAnnual Dividend Yield % (FWD): Left blank so I can sort it from highest to lowest.\n\nCash Flow Growth Last Year (%): At least 1% increase year-over-year, displaying the company’s ability to reinvest and grow dividend payments.\n\nEPS Growth Vs Prev Yr: Greater than 1%. Companies whose net profit increased over the past year.\n\nNumber of Analysts: 12 or more. A higher number suggests greater confidence in the rating.\n\nAnalyst Rating: Consensus Moderate to Strong Buy\n\nDividend Investing Ideas: Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nWith these filters set, I ran the screen and got 19 results and I'll cover three companies with the highest forward annual dividend yield.\n\nLet’s kick off the list with the first Dividend Aristocrat:\n\nAmcor Plc is a global packaging company that makes flexible and rigid packaging for various industries, including food, healthcare, and consumer products. Its wide product portfolio helps protect products, extend shelf life, and improve sustainability across markets worldwide.\n\nIn its recent quarterly financials, Amcor reported that sales rose 68% YOY to $5.4 billion and net income was up 9% to $177 million. But that’s not the whole story- its operating cash flow grew 5.22% in 2025, and full-year EPS increased 7.5%, which suggests (slow but) steady growth.\n\nAmcor has paid increasing dividends for 27 consecutive years. Today, it pays a forward annual dividend of $2.60, translating to a yield of just over 5%.\n\nMeanwhile, 16 analysts rate the stock a “Moderate Buy”. It has around 20% upside if it achieves its high target of $60.\n\nThe second Dividend Aristocrat is Federal Realty Investment Trust , a REIT that operates retail and mixed-use properties in high-income U.S. markets, primarily through shopping centers and urban retail locations.\n\nIts most recent quarterly financials reported that sales were up 6% YOY to $322 million. Net income also increased 1% to $61 million. Federal Realty’s operating cash flow rose 3.37% over the past year, while its EPS grew 3.51%, which is pretty solid as REITs are not usually built for rapid earnings expansion.\n\nFederal Realty has increased its dividends for 58 consecutive years, and currently pays a forward annual dividend of $4.52, translating to a yield of approximately 4.3%.\n\nFurther, a consensus among 19 analysts rates the stock a “Moderate Buy” and suggests there’s around 15% upside should it reach its target high of $120.\n\nThe final Dividend Aristocrat on my list today is McCormick & Company, a renowned food company known mainly for its wide range of spices used to enhance the taste of home and commercial food meals around the world. Actually, I think there’s a strong chance that at least one of its products is already sitting in my kitchen cabinet.\n\nIn its recent quarterly financials, McCormick reported sales increased 3% YOY to $1.9 billion, and operating cash flow rose 4.37%. On the bottom line, net income grew 5.3% to $227 million.\n\nIn terms of providing shareholder value, McCormick increased its dividends for 40 consecutive years, paying a forward annual dividend of $1.92, translating to a yield of ~2.7%.\n\nWith that, a consensus among 13 analysts rate the stock a “Moderate Buy” with as much as 24% upside potential if the stock hits its high target of $89.\n\nThere you have it, three of the highest-yielding Dividend Aristocrats worth buying today. They didn’t make the noisiest headlines, but they do continue to provide a stable source of income even through volatility. Though, as they say, nothing lasts forever, and past years’ results may not be as good as this year. But remember, it’s how all funds are sold- so it’s never wrong consider the fundamentals first.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Walmart WMT shares have been standout performers this year, handily outperforming not just the broader market indexes and brick-and-mortar retail peers but also Amazon AMZN and many members of the Magnificent 7 group.\n\nWith the company set to report quarterly results on Thursday, February 19th, it will be interesting to see whether the stock can maintain its momentum after the results.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart shares (green line, up +20.2%) relative to the Mag 7 group (blue line, down -5.4%), the S&P 500 index (red line, down -0.4%), Amazon (purple line, down -13.9%) and Target shares (orange line in the chart, up +18.2%). Target has also been added to the chart, though the company will be reporting quarterly results on Tuesday, March 3 rd .\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe should keep in mind, however, that the performance pecking order shifts when we move the starting point of this chart back by 12 months, as shown below. Target has enjoyed an impressive run this year, but the retailer’s one-year performance is comparable to Amazon’s.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart’s share price outperformance reflects the market’s collective optimism about the company’s large and growing digital business, which has enabled it to tap new growth opportunities such as third-party fulfillment and advertising.\n\nWalmart’s e-commerce business complements its core merchandise, which remains heavily indexed toward groceries, other essentials, and must-have necessities. This orientation towards essentials, coupled with Walmart’s well-earned reputation for low prices, provides the company’s results with a high degree of cyclical stability.\n\nWe should note, however, that a big contributing factor to Walmart’s stock market momentum over the last few years reflects its ability to gain market share among higher-income households. Driving those gains has been a combination of higher-income households trading down to Walmart in response to inflation and the ease of using the company’s e-commerce capabilities. Walmart has consistently flagged market-share gains across all income categories, particularly in the high-income category, and we expect further gains on that front in this quarterly report as well.\n\nResults likely benefited from pulled-forward demand in anticipation of tariffs, particularly in some categories like electronics. Growth in e-commerce and steadily lower losses in that business, coupled with gains from third-party fulfillment and advertising, are some of the other areas that will benefit results this quarter.\n\nThe e-commerce business in the U.S. is now profitable and will likely become a significant contributor to earnings in 2026 and beyond. E-commerce accounts for an estimated 15% of total ex-gasoline sales at present, which management sees eventually increasing to more than double that level over time.\n\nWith respect to tariffs, management noted earlier in the year that roughly two-thirds of U.S. sales were from domestically sourced products, which gave them a degree of insulation from the tariffs issue compared to others. A big part of this is Walmart’s groceries business, which accounts for almost 60% of its sales, unlike Target, where groceries are a much smaller part of the revenue mix.\n\nManagement has reiterated its commitment to maintain price advantage over rivals, a function of Walmart’s size, the nature of its supplier relationships, and the increasing automation of its logistical operations. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.73 in EPS on $189.9 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +10.6% and +5.2%, respectively. Estimates have been stable, though they have nudged up a hair since the quarter began.\n\nIn terms of same-store sales, the expectation is of U.S. comps (ex fuel) of +4.17%, which will compare to a +4.4% gain in the preceding quarter (vs. expectations of +4.02%), and a +4.9% gain in the year-earlier period (vs. expectations of +4.36%). A positive general merchandise read will also have positive read-throughs for Target.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2025 Q4 earnings season scorecard , we now have results from 13 of the 31 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 13 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have already reported Q4 results belong mostly to the e-commerce and restaurant industries, though we have several restaurant companies on deck to report this week as well.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for these 13 retailers that have reported are up +6.3% from the same period last year on +11.6% higher revenues, with 46.2% beating EPS estimates and 76.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the EPS beats percentages for these online players and restaurant operators are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. In fact, the Q4 EPS beats percentage at 46.2% matches the lowest beats percentage for this group of Retail sector companies in the preceding 20-quarter period. Unlike EPS beats, revenue beats are far more numerous and tracking above historical averages.\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 13 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q4 earnings were up +5.9% on +13.6% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart now a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s coming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player, thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThrough Friday, February 13 th , we have seen Q4 results from 371 S&P 500 members, or 74.2% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +8.8% higher revenues, with 75.5% beating EPS estimates and 72.5% beating revenue estimates.\n\nWe have more than 400 companies on deck to report results this week, including 56 index members. The week’s lineup includes a blend of operators such as Palo Alto Networks, DoorDash, Etsy, and Booking Holdings, as well as traditional bellwethers such as Toll Brothers, Deere, and others.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the growth rates for these 371 index members with what we had seen from this same group of companies in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages for this group companies relative to what we had seen from them in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison chart below puts the Q4 net margins for the 371 companies that have reported in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimates for the current period (2026 Q1) have risen modestly in recent days, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n2026 Q1 estimates have increased modestly for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the start of January, including Tech, Industrials, Retail, Utilities, and Business Services. On the negative side, Q1 estimates have come down for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Energy, Medical, and Consumer Discretionary sectors.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Analyzing the Evolving Earnings Picture: What Should Investors Know?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) is causing Amazon to invest heavily across the infrastructure value chain -- from building data centers, designing its own custom silicon, and complementing these chips with GPUs from Nvidia .\n\nAmazon reported earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2025 on Feb. 5. Prior to the report, Wall Street was expecting management to guide for around $150 billion in capex this year. With this in mind, investors had sticker shock when the company's plans for $200 billion capex were revealed.\n\nThe trends in the chart sum up why Wall Street is getting skittish over Amazon. The inverse correlation between rising infrastructure spend and decelerating cash flow generation is a major concern for investors.\n\nWhere investors may be missing the mark is looking at Amazon's revenue growth. Over the last year, sales and operating profits from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division have consistently risen. In other words, Amazon's high-margin cloud business is experiencing both accelerating sales and profit margins.\n\nThis dynamic is allowing the company to allocate capital across so many different AI-related projects. Building its own data centers and custom chips, alongside its strategic investment in Anthropic, is helping Amazon vertically integrate its AI operations.\n\nIn the long run, this should significantly reduce costs and lead to stronger earnings growth. When you think about it this way, Amazon's playbook to double down on its AI infrastructure roadmap looks savvy. While rising capex may be a near-term dent for free cash flow, the long-term gains are hard to deny.\n\nAs of this writing, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is hovering near its lowest level throughout the entire AI revolution.\n\nConsidering sales from AWS are beginning to reaccelerate and are complemented by robust profit margins, I am confident that Amazon's decision to continue investing in AI infrastructure makes sense strategically.

Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nRad AI's award-winning artificial intelligence technology helps transform data chaos into actionable insights, enabling the creation of high-performing content with measurable ROI. Their Regulation A+ offering allows investors to participate at $0.85 per share with a minimum investment of $1,000, providing an opportunity to diversify portfolios into early-stage AI innovation. For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly growing AI and tech sector, Rad AI offers a chance to get in on the ground floor of a data-driven growth story.\n\nBacked by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nLightstone DIRECT gives accredited investors direct access to institutional-grade real estate, going beyond typical crowdfunding platforms. By cutting out middlemen, it aligns investor and manager interests while providing exposure to a $12B+ portfolio spanning multifamily, industrial, hospitality, retail, office, and life science properties. This approach allows investors to diversify their portfolios across multiple property types and markets , gaining professional-grade real estate exposure without the fees or misalignment common on other platforms.\n\nMasterworks enables investors to diversify into blue-chip art, an alternative asset class with historically low correlation to stocks and bonds. Through fractional ownership of museum-quality works by artists like Banksy, Basquiat, and Picasso, investors gain access without the high costs or complexities of owning art outright. With hundreds of offerings and strong historical exits on select works, Masterworks adds a scarce, globally traded asset to portfolios seeking long-term diversification.\n\nBAM Capital offers accredited investors a way to diversify beyond public markets through institutional-grade multifamily real estate . With over $1.85 billion in completed transactions and guidance from Senior Economic Advisor Tony Landa, the firm targets income and long-term growth as supply tightens and renter demand remains strong—especially in Midwest markets.

      "Content": "In early February 2026, Silicon Motion Technology Corporation reported that fourth-quarter 2025 sales rose to US$278.46 million with net income of US$47.75 million, while full-year 2025 sales reached US$885.63 million and net income was US$122.64 million, all higher than the prior year.\n\nAlongside these results, the company issued first-quarter 2026 guidance calling for sequential revenue growth and double-digit operating margins, while also reaffirming its regular dividend, highlighting a combination of earnings momentum and ongoing cash returns to shareholders.\n\nNow we’ll examine how this stronger-than-prior-year profitability and upbeat first-quarter guidance could reshape Silicon Motion’s existing investment narrative.\n\nUncover the next big thing with 28 elite penny stocks that balance risk and reward.\n\nTo own Silicon Motion, you need to believe its NAND controller niche can stay profitable despite intense price competition and customer concentration. The latest beat-and-raise quarter strengthens the short term catalyst of execution on revenue growth and margins, but it does not eliminate the key risk that rising R&D and operating costs could again outpace sales and pressure profitability if demand or pricing weakens.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement is the first quarter 2026 guidance for revenue of US$292 million to US$306 million and operating margins in the low to mid teens. This outlook builds on the stronger than prior year 2025 results and puts the spotlight squarely on whether Silicon Motion can convert its design wins into sustained top line growth while keeping expenses in check and margins within its guided range.\n\nYet, against this stronger backdrop, the ongoing risk that margin pressure could re emerge from high R&D spend is something investors should be aware of...\n\nRead the full narrative on Silicon Motion Technology (it's free!)\n\nSilicon Motion Technology's narrative projects $1.2 billion revenue and $196.6 million earnings by 2028. This requires 14.8% yearly revenue growth and an increase in earnings of about $118.4 million from $78.2 million today.\n\nUncover how Silicon Motion Technology's forecasts yield a $114.00 fair value , a 16% downside to its current price.\n\nBefore this news, the most optimistic analysts were already assuming about US$1.1 billion of revenue and US$184 million of earnings by 2028, so if you believe the recent guidance signals that operational bottlenecks are easing faster than expected, you may see their narrative as far more optimistic than the baseline view that focuses on controller concentration risk.\n\nExplore 5 other fair value estimates on Silicon Motion Technology - why the stock might be worth less than half the current price!\n\nDisagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "Applied Materials ( AMAT ) reported its Q1 earnings on February 12. The earnings beat consensus estimates for adjusted EPS and revenue, and the stock is trading 10% higher at the time of writing, Friday morning, Feb. 13, according to Yahoo Finance .\n\nThe supplier of semiconductor and semiconductor-related fabrication equipment reported revenue of $7 billion, a 2% year-over-year decline, yet the earnings report got investors excited and prompted Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya to raise his price target for Applied Materials.\n\nThe cause of excitement was CEO Gary Dickerson’s prepared remarks during the earnings call : “For Applied, we expect to grow our semiconductor equipment business more than 20% this calendar year. We see the demand profile weighted towards the second half of the calendar year, with availability of customer cleanroom space being a key factor pacing the rate of investment.”\n\nDickerson continued by making this great outlook sound even better. “Our largest customers are giving us increased longer-term visibility to ensure we have operational capacity and service support in place for their ramps,\" he added.\n\n\"Based on this visibility, we expect strong growth momentum to be carried into 2027.”\n\nTo put it all in perspective, we can look at the complete Q2 guidance versus what analysts expected. The numbers come from the Bank of America research note shared with TheStreet.\n\nMetric\n\nManagement Guidance (Q2 2026)\n\nWall Street Consensus\n\nBank of America\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n$7.65 Billion (±$500M)\n\n$7.03 Billion\n\n$6.85 billion\n\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS\n\n$2.64 (±$0.20)\n\n$2.29\n\n$2.20\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\n\n~49.3%\n\n48.5%\n\n48.4%\n\nThe great outlook makes even more sense when we consider what the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) estimates for 2026.\n\n“The global semiconductor industry posted its highest-ever annual sales in 2025, nearly hitting $800 billion, and global sales in 2026 are projected to reach roughly $1 trillion,” stated SIA CEO John Neuffer.\n\nFollowing the report’s release, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya and his team updated their view on AMAT stock.\n\nRevenue of $7.65 billion\n\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.64\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 49.3%\n\nThe team estimates the company will gain approximately 1% in 2026, thanks to cyclical growth, leadership in DRAM, advanced packaging, and deposition and conductor etch systems.\n\nAnalysts raised their non-GAAP EPS estimates for 2026 and 2027 by 18% and 24% to $11.86 and $14.57, respectively.\n\nApplied Global Services could grow at a rate higher than the typical low-double-digit pace through steady install base expansion, with all recurring revenue helping fund capital returns.\n\nApplied Materials captures more than 50% of the serviceable addressable market share in inflection points such as Gate-All-Around (GAA) and backside power delivery, where revenue opportunities increase by 30% versus FinFET .\n\nSystems' gross margins of 54% improved by 1% year over year and can expand further as Applied Materials prices to value.\n\nRelated: Bank of America resets Amazon stock price target after earnings\n\nArya reiterated his buy rating for AMAT stock and raised the price target to $420 from $350, based on his 29 multiple of his price-to-earnings ratio estimate for calendar year 2027.\n\nHe said the multiple is at the high end of Applied Materials’ historical trading range of 10 to 30. The numbers are justified by the potential for wafer fab equipment outgrowth in 2026 and 2027, Arya added, and they remain at a discount relative to other large peers, given a more balanced growth profile and lower profitability.\n\nSlower-than-expected capital spending cycle\n\nDelay in memory capacity adds\n\nMarket share loss in deposition, implant, thermal, chemical mechanical planarization, etch, or process control segments\n\nDemand destruction in PCs and mobile as a headwind\n\nMerger and integration risk, along with macro headwinds\n\nApplied Materials reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, regarding allegations that certain customer shipments to China between November 2020 and July 2022 did not comply with the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, based on the company’s misunderstanding of the applicability of those regulations.\n\nThe company has agreed to pay $252.5 million to the Department of Commerce. The U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have closed their related investigations without action.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nApplied Materials announced that Samsung Electronics will join the new, $5 billion Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization (EPIC) Center in Silicon Valley. According to Applied Materials, its EPIC Center will open this year as the world’s largest facility for collaborative research and development of semiconductor process technology and manufacturing equipment.\n\nThe co-development programs at the EPIC Center will be designed to speed up the development and deployment of next-generation semiconductor technologies. The joint research and development programs will work on new materials and process technologies for chips, multiple manufacturing processes (nodes) ahead of the current generation.\n\nApplied Materials introduced new deposition, etch, and materials-modification systems that boost the performance of logic chips at 2nm and beyond. The transition to GAA transistors is a pivotal moment for the industry, as it will enable energy-efficient computing needed to deliver more powerful AI chips.\n\n“The rapid progress of AI is pushing compute performance to the limit, and breakthroughs in computing begin with the transistor,” said Dr. Prabu Raja, president of the Semiconductor Products Group at Applied Materials.\n\n“To keep pace in the angstrom era, Applied is delivering materials engineering breakthroughs that improve energy-efficient compute. Together, these new systems extend Applied’s longstanding leadership in driving major transistor and wiring inflections, while helping customers accelerate their chip roadmaps to keep up with the blistering pace of AI.”\n\nRelated: Bank of America resets Qualcomm stock price target after earnings\n\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 13, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "It has been just under a year since digital storage giant Western Digital spun off flash storage specialist Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) , and the latter has turned into one of the hottest stocks on the market since its separation.\n\nShares of the company -- which specializes in NAND flash storage solutions for smartphones, personal computers (PCs), tablets, automotive applications, wearable devices, and data centers -- have shot up a stunning 1,400% since the spin-off. Investors may now be wondering whether it is worth holding this semiconductor stock after its red-hot rally.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nLet's take a closer look at Sandisk's long-term prospects and check whether it can deliver more upside over the next three years.\n\nWe have already seen that Sandisk's storage solutions are used across multiple applications. The edge devices market, which includes PCs and smartphones, is its largest business segment, accounting for 55% of its revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on Jan. 2, 2026). Sandisk's revenue from this segment shot up by 63% from the year-ago period, to just under $1.7 billion.\n\nThe company pointed out that the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the PC and smartphone markets is a major catalyst for this segment. That's not surprising, as generative AI-capable smartphones and PCs are equipped with higher storage to support local AI tasks. Importantly, shipments of these devices are poised to accelerate at a healthy pace over the next three years.\n\nMarket research firm IDC estimates that generative AI smartphone shipments could jump to 912 million units in 2028, up from 234 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, generative AI PC shipments are predicted to jump to 138 million units in 2028, up from just over 24 million units in 2024. So, Sandisk should continue to witness healthy demand from these end markets in the long run.\n\nAt the same time, investors should note the strong growth Sandisk is witnessing in data centers, where demand for fast flash storage solutions such as solid-state drives (SSDs) is increasing. SSDs offer much faster data transfer speeds and greater energy efficiency than hard-disk drives (HDDs). Specifically, SSDs can be a hundred times faster than HDDs, enabling instant data transfer at higher bandwidths.\n\nOf course, HDDs are significantly cheaper than SSDs. However, the shortage of HDDs is pushing AI infrastructure companies toward SSDs. SSDs can also reduce the total operating costs of data centers thanks to their energy efficiency and faster data transfer rates.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see the data center business moving the needle in a bigger way for Sandisk over the next three years, especially considering the massive investments in this space . The company reported a 76% year-over-year increase in data center revenue in the previous quarter to $440 million. This impressive growth seems sustainable, as Sandisk's storage solutions have been qualified for use by a second hyperscaler customer, and it is on track to bring additional hyperscalers on board.\n\nSandisk notes that it will begin recognizing revenue from its new hyperscaler customers in the next few quarters. All this explains why analysts are expecting a sharp spike in Sandisk's top line. Specifically, its revenue is expected to more than double in the current fiscal year from $7.36 billion in the previous one, followed by another significant jump in the next fiscal year.\n\nSandisk isn't just enjoying healthy top-line growth. The supply-constrained nature of the memory market is also pushing prices higher. According to market research firm TrendForce, NAND flash memory prices could jump by 55% to 60% in the ongoing quarter, up from the earlier estimate of 33% to 38%.\n\nWhat's more, NAND flash memory is expected to remain in short supply through 2028, driven by a jump of almost 3x in demand by that time as compared to 2024 levels. This should pave the way for a robust jump in Sandisk's earnings, following a projected 1,220% increase in the current one to $39.45 per share. As the following chart indicates, Sandisk's earnings could almost double in the next fiscal year.\n\nGiven that the flash storage market is likely to sustain solid growth beyond next year, Sandisk could see a big jump in its earnings after the next couple of years. But even if we assume a conservative 25% increase in its bottom line in fiscal 2028, its earnings could jump to just over $95 per share within the next three years.\n\nMultiplying the projected earnings by the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 25 points toward a stock price of $2,375, which is over 4x Sandisk's current stock price. So this AI stock has the potential to become a multibagger over the next three years. That's why investors should consider buying it hand over fist, as it is trading at just 15 times forward earnings right now.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sandisk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sandisk wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Where does the time go? Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRKA) (NYSE: BRKB) first earnings report in the post- Warren Buffett era is almost upon us. Buffett, of course, is still on the scene as chairman, but as of Jan. 1, he's no longer CEO.\n\nRegardless, Berkshire -- which hasn't formally set a date for disseminating its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results -- will likely unveil them toward the end of February. Here's my take on whether it's wise to load up on the popular stock in the run-up to the event, or sit on the sidelines.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nBerkshire's business comprises its sizable insurance operations (anchored by the well-known Geico), full or partial stakes in private enterprises, and its vaunted equity portfolio.\n\nWhile the insurance end of the company is the foundation of its business and that portfolio of private companies is considerable, it's the equity holdings that get the most attention. The major development recently with this daunting lineup is Berkshire's chunky stock sell-offs , such as Apple and Bank of America , and its accumulation of highly liquid assets (specifically cash and cash equivalents and U.S. Treasuries).\n\nSince the end of the first quarter of 2024, shortly before it started seriously unloading its stakes in those companies, to Q3 2025's quarter-end, the stack of those liquid assets has doubled and then some from $182 billion and change to more than $377 billion. This figure, by the way, exceeds the under $330 billion market cap of the entire equity portfolio at present.\n\nThe consensus on Berkshire's strategy is that its cash and other liquid holdings are a kind of flexibility tool that will come in handy when more stock market bargains present themselves. And snapping up shares of undervalued companies is one of the activities the company excels at.\n\nGiven that, I'd say we'll see impressive growth in its equity portfolio over the coming quarters and years, and, as ever, it'll lift the value of Berkshire as a whole. I think the company's stock is a smart buy in advance of earnings.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) 7.3% move over the past 24 hours, as of 4:00 p.m. ET, is one I think investors are right to cheer today. After all, we haven't had many days in which Ethereum has trended higher over the past four months or so. Thus, a move of more than 7% higher in such a short time frame is worth celebrating.\n\nNow, as is the case with most rallies in the cryptocurrency sector, it's a sea of green today, with most tokens moving in the same direction. That said, among the five largest digital assets in the market, Ethereum is leading the way with today's move.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nLet's dive into three key factors shaping today's direction of travel for those invested in Ethereum.\n\nWhen a world-class asset like Ethereum gets beaten down to the extent it has over the past few months (falling more than 55% from its peak), one could argue that this crypto token has become too cheap to ignore for some investors. In concert with an inflation reading from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released this morning (which showed lower-than-expected inflation), investors increasingly believe that a weakening jobs market and continued improvements in inflation could lead to lower interest rates over time. That would be broadly beneficial for those who want to remain invested in more speculative, high-growth investments like Ethereum.\n\nAnother key factor to consider is Ethereum's stalwart status as the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) player in the market. Given Ethereum's outperformance when risk-on sentiment proliferates, due to its incredible network effects and importance in derivatives markets, this broad-based rally today has an outsize impact. That's not a coincidence, in my view.\n\nThat brings me to my final point: a mass unwinding of bearish bets on Ethereum, mainly in the perpetual futures and derivatives markets, has led to a buying surge that has propelled this token higher faster than many of its peers. I'd expect this rally to continue, so long as momentum remains strong, and this token doesn't enter overbought territory. Given how oversold Ethereum has become in recent weeks, I think it would take a much larger and protracted rally for such a scenario to unfold.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "If you haven't looked at Nokia (NYSE: NOK) stock lately, you might be surprised. Most consumers remember Nokia as a leading cellphone company that found itself pushed aside by the introduction of the smartphone.\n\nHowever, Nokia has reinvented itself as a telecom equipment company, and the tech stock now trades at its highest levels in more than 10 years. Despite those gains, its long-term growth may have barely begun; here's why.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nSo, what happened? The one reason investors have suddenly become interested in the stock is because of a deal with Nvidia . The two companies will create AI-RAN (radio access network) products powered by Nvidia's GPUs. This will tie Nvidia to the cellular network infrastructure business and give Nokia a competitive edge in optimizing 5G and later 6G networks.\n\nThanks to this deal, Nokia's stock is surging, with the stock rising by almost 50% over the last year.\n\nMoreover, despite breaking out of a range, the stock may not stop moving higher, although it now sells at a 54 P/E ratio, with a forward earnings multiple of just 19.\n\nThe falling forward multiple is likely a product of the anticipated revenue growth, which usually boosts profits. Analysts forecast a 7% increase in revenue this year, and they expect that revenue growth rate to rise to 15% in 2027. Accelerating revenue growth tends to be bullish for stocks over time, giving prospective shareholders time to buy. Additionally, faster revenue growth tends to lead to expanding multiples, which could serve as another tailwind for the stock.\n\nHence, between the rising demand for Nokia's Nvidia-powered equipment and the company's improving financials, Nokia stock could become a surprising long-term winner .\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nokia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nokia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor , and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 13, 2026.\n\nWill Healy has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "Friday, February 13, 2026\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), as well as two micro-cap stocks Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc. (NGVC) and Team, Inc. (TISI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is benefiting from the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI)-driven memory and storage markets. The positive impacts of inventory improvement across multiple end markets are driving top-line growth.\n\nThe surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery will aid significant revenue and earnings growth in the coming quarters. Its solid financials, positive free cash flow and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while enhancing shareholder value.\n\nMicron Technology&rsquo;s long-term customer agreements and expanding AI partnerships reduce volatility and enhance revenue visibility. Nonetheless, rising operating costs and a massive increase in capital expenditure pose a downside risk to Micron&rsquo;s near-term profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>> )\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past six months (+22.3% vs. +7.5%). The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. It is refocusing on the core strengths of investment banking (IB) and trading businesses through restructuring and scaling back its consumer banking footprint, which will likely support top line growth in the upcoming period.\n\nHowever, its high dependence on overseas revenues is worrisome. The rising expense base due to ongoing investments in technology and elevated transaction-based costs during periods of higher client activity might hamper near term profitability.\n\nNonetheless, the company's expansion in the private equity credit market is expected to diversify revenues and will support its growth over the long run. Further, a solid liquidity profile will support its capital distribution activities.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Goldman Sachs here >>> )\n\nVerizon&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past six months (+17.7% vs. -1.3%). The company recorded solid fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The buyout of Frontier Communications has accelerated its broadband expansion plans.\n\nVerizon appears to be at a critical inflection point and remains focused on making necessary capital expenditures for steady 5G deployment, the densification of the 4G LTE wireless network to cater to huge traffic demands across multiple verticals and fiber densification.\n\nHowever, the spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage surging data traffic. High spending on promotional activities to attract customers is straining Verizon&rsquo;s profits. Weakness in the wireline business is another concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>> )\n\nShares of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage have underperformed the Zacks Food - Natural Foods Products industry over the past six months (-32.8% vs. -25.9%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $595.64 million is facing risks which include margin pressure from inventory shrink, long-term lease obligations limiting flexibility, macro and supply chain vulnerabilities, and weak digital capabilities. Trading at just 0.43X EV/sales and 6.02X EV/EBITDA, valuations are attractive versus peers.\n\nNevertheless, Natural Grocers posted a 14% YoY rise in Q1 FY26 net income to $11.3M, with EPS up to 49 cents, supported by disciplined cost control and 1.6% revenue growth. EBITDA rose to $22.6M, highlighting operational leverage despite modest top-line gains. Strong liquidity ($23.2M cash, $67.6M credit availability) and a debt-light balance sheet support a 25% dividend hike and active buybacks.\n\nNatural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage is expanding cautiously with 6&ndash;8 new stores planned, enhancing brand reach in underserved markets. Its 900+ private-label SKUs support margin and loyalty, reinforcing differentiation in the competitive organic segment. Operating efficiency improved.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage here >>> )\n\nTeam&rsquo;s shares have underperformed the Zacks Building Products - Maintenance Service industry over the past six months (-34.3% vs. +2.5%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $65.64 million is facing structural leverage, high interest burden, persistent GAAP losses, working capital drag, MS segment margin volatility and contingent legal liabilities. Upside hinges on sustained margin expansion, cash flow conversion and progress toward double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins.\n\nNevertheless, Team benefits from a large, durable opportunity in critical infrastructure services, supported by aging assets, regulatory requirements, and sustained energy, midstream and industrial demand. The third-quarter 2025 results showed solid execution, with 6.7% year-over-year revenue growth, strong momentum in the IHT and MS segments, and meaningful margin expansion,driven by pricing, mix and cost discipline.\n\nCanadian operations are recovering, validating localized commercial strategies, while an integrated service model supports lifecycle-driven growth and operating leverage.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Team here >>> )\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT), Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) and Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC).\n\nMark Vickery\nSenior Editor\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monolithic-power-systems-links-cfo-211316162.html",
      "Content": "Find your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems (NasdaqGS:MPWR) announced the planned retirement of long-serving CFO and Executive Vice President Bernie Blegen.\n\nThe company named an interim CFO to support continuity in its finance leadership during the transition.\n\nAlongside the leadership changes, Monolithic Power Systems approved a higher quarterly dividend following robust quarterly results.\n\nFor investors watching Monolithic Power Systems at a share price of $1,155.93, these updates connect leadership change directly to recent business performance. The stock has gained 23.5% year to date and 66.5% over the past year, with a 218.9% return over five years. This performance places the latest board and management decisions under a brighter spotlight.\n\nThe higher dividend and CFO transition, together with what the company describes as robust quarterly results, reflect management's current view of the business. For you as a shareholder or prospective investor, this combination of capital return and leadership reshuffle is a useful moment to reassess how Monolithic Power Systems fits within your broader portfolio and risk tolerance.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Monolithic Power Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Monolithic Power Systems.\n\nDoes the team leading Monolithic Power Systems have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\n\nThe leadership change at Monolithic Power Systems comes at a time when the business is reporting strong revenue but materially lower earnings compared to last year. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2025 were US$751.16 million versus US$621.67 million a year earlier, while net income for the quarter and full year fell versus 2024. At the same time, the Board lifted the quarterly dividend from US$1.56 to US$2.00 per share and guided first quarter 2026 revenue to US$770 million to US$790 million. For you, that pairing of a higher cash payout with a long-planned CFO retirement and interim appointment signals confidence in the balance sheet and cash generation, but it also puts more attention on how the next finance leader will manage costs and capital allocation. With Bernie Blegen staying on to support the handover and Rob Dean stepping in as interim CFO after nine years as Corporate Controller, the company is emphasizing continuity rather than a reset in direction.\n\nThe earnings beat and record quarterly revenue line up with the existing narrative that AI data center, enterprise data and automotive demand are important drivers of Monolithic Power Systems’ growth story.\n\nLower net income and earnings per share versus last year raise questions about how much margin pressure rising investment, supply chain costs or mix shifts could create, which is a potential counterpoint to expectations of sustained earnings leverage.\n\nThe dividend increase and CFO transition are not central in the existing narrative, which focuses more on end markets and capacity build out, so income-focused capital returns and leadership succession may not be fully reflected in that story.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Monolithic Power Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\nProfit margins of 22.1% are lower than 81% last year, which shows a large compression in profitability that you may want to understand in more detail.\n\nThere has been significant insider selling over the past 3 months, which can sometimes signal that management and directors are reducing exposure at current levels.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings to grow 21.26% per year, which, if achieved, would support the view that Monolithic Power Systems can continue to build on its current scale.\n\nThe company reports strong demand in enterprise data, communications and automotive, which helps diversify away from a single end market and can reduce reliance on any one customer segment.\n\nFrom here, you may want to watch three things in particular. First, how the interim CFO and eventual successor explain margin trends and capital allocation, including the sustainability of the higher US$2.00 quarterly dividend. Second, whether revenue in early 2026 stays within or above the guided US$770 million to US$790 million range, especially in AI data center and automotive segments where Monolithic Power Systems competes with peers such as Texas Instruments, Analog Devices and ON Semiconductor. Third, how insider trading activity evolves now that compensation related stock sales have been disclosed. Together, these factors will help you judge whether the leadership transition is simply a well managed handoff or a point where the company’s risk and return profile starts to change.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Monolithic Power Systems, head to the community page for Monolithic Power Systems to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the tech landscape at breakneck speed, and investors are scrambling to lock in the biggest winners. Yet even in a crowded AI trade, few names have delivered like Micron Technology (MU). The memory-chip giant has ridden the AI wave to record highs, with MU stock delivering massive returns over the past year. Surging demand for memory chips from AI hyperscalers racing to build out massive data center capacity has been the primary engine behind Micron’s remarkable ascent.\n\nBut every rally eventually meets a reality check. Micron’s momentum recently hit a speed bump earlier this week after reports suggested that Samsung Electronics is nearing certification from Nvidia (NVDA) for its next-generation HBM4 chips. High-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized chip designed to move enormous volumes of data at ultra-fast speeds, is a critical component inside AI accelerators.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nNvidia relies heavily on HBM for its AI processors, making supplier approvals a closely watched development on Wall Street. Now, with Samsung reportedly preparing to begin mass production of its next-generation HBM chips earlier than expected, competitive dynamics in the AI memory space could shift quickly.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant’s progress threatens to add meaningful pressure on Micron, which is a key supplier of advanced memory products used across data centers and AI infrastructure. Given this latest development, should you buy, sell, or hold MU stock? Let's take a closer look.\n\nBased in Boise, Idaho, Micron Technology stands at the center of the global memory market, supplying the chips that quietly power today’s data-driven world. The company designs and manufactures a broad portfolio of DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory products that sit inside everything from cloud data centers to smartphones and connected devices.\n\nWith a strong emphasis on engineering expertise and manufacturing scale, Micron plays a critical role in enabling AI workloads and other compute-intensive applications. From large-scale data centers to edge devices and mobile platforms, its memory and storage solutions form the backbone of systems that process, store, and move vast amounts of information every day. With a market capitalization of roughly $465 billion, Micron has grown into a semiconductor heavyweight.\n\nShares dipped about 2.8% on Feb. 9 following news surrounding Samsung, but that pullback barely dents what has been an extraordinary run. Over the past year, the stock has skyrocketed an eye-popping 336%, leaving the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) — up just 12% over the same stretch — far in the dust. After touching a record high of $455.50 last month, Micron now sits only about 9% below that peak, underscoring just how powerful its AI-fueled rally has been.\n\nWhile Micron has delivered a breathtaking rally, its valuation remains far from excessive. MU stock trades at roughly 12.6 times forward earnings, a sharp discount to the sector median of 23.6 times. For a company powering the AI memory boom, that gap suggests investors are still paying a relatively modest price for its growth trajectory, even after an extraordinary run.\n\nMicron kicked off fiscal 2026 with a strong quarter. In its Dec. 17 earnings report, the company crushed both top- and bottom-line expectations, posting revenue of $13.6 billion, up 57% year-over-year (YOY) and comfortably ahead of the $12.7 billion consensus estimate. The results marked Micron’s third-straight quarter of record revenue, powered by a 69% surge in DRAM sales and a 22% increase in NAND revenue.\n\nDRAM alone generated $10.8 billion, accounting for 79% of total sales, while NAND contributed $2.7 billion, or 20%. Notably, total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, HBM and data center revenue, and revenue across each business unit all reached new records. Cloud memory sales climbed to $5.28 billion, doubling YOY, while core data center revenue rose 4% annually to $2.38 billion.\n\nThe company said performance across both major segments was driven by higher pricing. Profitability also followed a similar growth trajectory. Adjusted gross margin came in at 56.8%, up from 39.5% in the year-ago quarter. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS soared a stunning 167% YOY to $4.78, crushing the Street’s $3.78 estimate.\n\nLooking ahead, Micron struck an optimistic tone for Q2 fiscal 2026, projecting revenue of around $18.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.42. Management expects strong AI-driven demand across data centers and edge computing to continue, even as supply constraints are likely to persist through 2026, a backdrop that could further reinforce pricing strength.\n\nDespite intensifying competition, Wall Street’s conviction in Micron remains firmly intact. MU stock carries a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, with 33 out of 42 analysts calling it a “Strong Buy,” six assigning a “Moderate Buy” rating, and just three recommending a “Hold.”\n\nEven after its powerful run, optimism hasn’t faded. While MU has already surged beyond its average price target of $345.97, the Street-high target of $500 implies that there could still be roughly 21% upside ahead. That's a sign that many analysts believe the AI-driven momentum is far from over.\n\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Title": "NVIDIA vs. SMCI: Which AI Hardware Stock Is the Better Buy Now?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-vs-smci-ai-hardware-200000479.html",
      "Content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI are both currently riding the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom. But with Supermicro facing margin pressure and NVIDIA offering far stronger profitability metrics, could NVDA now be the better investment? Let’s take a closer look –\n\nThe rise in data center capital spending has led to stiff competition between NVIDIA and its peers, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC. However, despite the challenges, NVIDIA managed to post solid quarterly results consistently, banking on the rapid progress in AI. Quarter after quarter, NVIDIA’s performances were commendable due to the increasing demand for its chips, including the latest Blackwell architecture and cloud-based graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNVIDIA’s revenues jumped 62% year over year and 22% sequentially to $57 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2026, according to investor.nvidia.com. In fact, the company expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to come in at nearly $65 billion, with a plus or minus 2%. And why not? Thawing trade tensions between the United States and China are expected to support NVIDIA’s sales. The U.S. government has approved the shipment of NVIDIA’s H200 AI chips to China, while Chinese authorities have permitted their sale to selected customers.\n\nAI is significantly increasing demand for hardware, which is likely benefiting Supermicro. The company’s Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) has seen growing adoption among AI clients, offering a comprehensive package that includes integrated servers, networking, storage, cooling, software and related services. This momentum has translated into robust revenue growth, with its fiscal second-quarter 2026 sales climbing 123% year over year to $12.7 billion, easily exceeding analysts’ expectations of $10.4 billion, according to ir.supermicro.com.\n\nCEO of Supermicro, Charles Liang, added that Supermicro is scaling its AI server and storage capabilities and that its DCBBS helps customers deploy AI infrastructure faster and cost-efficiently, positioning the company to gain from the next wave of AI demand. Management remains bullish about Supermicro’s sales outlook, expecting fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues to reach $12.3 billion, and full-year net sales to hit $40 billion or more.\n\nDespite Supermicro’s rapid rise in revenue growth, ongoing pressure on its gross margins for some time has remained a concern. So, Supermicro earns less profit per dollar of sales. This is largely because, acting as an intermediary between NVIDIA and cost-conscious customers, its products have offered limited differentiation in a highly challenging, commoditized market.\n\nNonetheless, Supermicro’s gross margins dropped to 6.3% in fiscal second-quarter 2026 from 11.8% in the same quarter last year and 9.3% in the fiscal first quarter of 2026. Such low margins indicate that the company may face difficulties in generating profits once operating expenses are considered. In contrast, NVIDIA continues to demonstrate strong profitability, with its gross margin increasing to 73.4% in fiscal third-quarter 2026 from 72.4% in the fiscal second quarter of 2026, alongside steady revenue growth.\n\nNVIDIA, anyhow, consistently delivered stronger profits than Supermicro, reflected in its return on equity (ROE) of 99.2% compared with SMCI’s 17.8%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSupermicro, meanwhile, has a debt-to-equity ratio of 66.9%, higher than NVIDIA’s 6.3%, suggesting greater financial risk and increased exposure to economic headwinds.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTherefore, NVIDIA clearly stands out as the better stock to buy at this time, thanks to robust demand for its advanced chips and improving trade relations. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Supermicro has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Chinese tech firms have placed large orders for the H200, leading Nvidia to push Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd .

      "Content": "Wall Street may argue all about the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, but big tech's spending plans in global AI infrastructure are too large to ignore, right now. Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms expect to collectively spend roughly $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up about 60% year over year.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWith a significant portion of this spending already locked in through data center permits, power contracts, and supply agreements, core AI infrastructure players such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are likely to benefit from the near-term demand.\n\nHere's why stocks of these two companies can go parabolic in the coming years.\n\nNvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, refers to AI as the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history.\" The company estimates global AI infrastructure spending to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of 2030. With a full-stack AI platform that includes hardware, software, and enterprise platforms and an annual product cadence (releasing new upgrades and architectures each year), the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nIn 2026, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting Nvidia's Blackwell B200 systems, which the company claims deliver up to 30x higher inference (real-time model deployment) performance and better power efficiency than the prior-generation H100 chips. The company is also focusing on selling rack-scale solutions such as GB200 NVL72 \"AI factory\" systems, which bundle CPUs, GPUs, networking interconnects, and supporting software into complete AI server solutions, instead of stand-alone chips. This transition can eventually boost average selling prices and the company's margins.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, the company has introduced the Vera Rubin system, a six-chip platform designed to deliver even higher performance and power efficiency than Blackwell systems for complex AI and agentic AI workloads. With Vera Rubin currently in full production, the company expects to launch these systems in the second half of 2026. Management has highlighted cumulative revenue visibility for Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin systems of over $500 billion from the start of 2025 through the end of 2026.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, Nvidia's stock may soar in the coming years.\n\nBroadcom is also a major beneficiary of the increasing enterprise and hyperscaler spending on custom chips and high-speed networking in AI data centers.\n\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, hyperscalers are increasingly deploying custom AI server chips for specialized AI training and real-time deployment workloads. Broadcom is estimated to account for almost 60% share of this market by 2027.\n\nThat growing adoption is already translating into a multiyear backlog. Broadcom exited fiscal 2025 (ending Nov. 2, 2025) with a consolidated backlog of $162 billion, of which custom AI chips accounted for $73 billion to be delivered over the next 18 months. The company's networking switches are also seeing increased demand in AI data centers, as evidenced by the over $10 billion AI switch backlog at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nBroadcom reported a 65% year-over-year jump in AI revenues to $20 billion, driven by demand for custom chips, high-speed networking, and optical interconnects. This revenue growth trajectory can become even steeper if the company's backlog converts as expected or faster, and it has a few new multiyear client wins.\n\nHence, Broadcom can see parabolic growth even at current elevated valuation levels.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-boom-defense-backlogs-2-190000716.html",
      "Content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently projected global GDP growth of approximately 3.3% for 2026, reflecting steady expansion supported in part by continued corporate investment in digital infrastructure and advanced technologies. Labor market data further supports this resilience. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently reported that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 in January 2026, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.3%. The labor force participation rate was 62.5%, signaling a broadly stable employment environment.\n\nWithin this macro backdrop, hiring momentum remains firm across aerospace and defense, technology and digital services, with electronics among the faster-growing segments.\n\nAs per Deloitte’s recent industry projection report, the global semiconductor industry is expected to reach $975 billion in annual sales in 2026, a historic peak fueled by an intensifying AI infrastructure boom.\n\nTaken together, steady global growth, resilient labor markets and sustained technology investment create a constructive setting for equity markets. In this environment, AI-linked infrastructure and healthcare innovation stand out as two sectors offering clear earnings visibility and structural support heading into mid-2026.\n\nBelow are the two sectors that we expect to outperform the broader market this year, supported by strong demand drivers and favorable earnings momentum.\n\nAI-driven capital expenditure remains a core earnings catalyst in 2026. Hyperscalers, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, continue allocating substantial budgets toward AI data centers and cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association projects global semiconductor sales to approach $1 trillion in 2026, implying 26% industry growth, driven primarily by advanced logic and high-bandwidth memory tied to generative AI workloads. This underpins earnings visibility for GPU and accelerator suppliers such as NVIDIA NVDA and foundry leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor TSM. Equipment vendors, including ASML ASML and Applied Materials AMAT, also benefit from leading-edge node expansion. While TSM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NVDA, ASML and AMAT carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe industrial sector is supported by sustained defense spending, commercial aerospace backlog strength and accelerating electrification investment. U.S. national defense spending has remained above $800 billion annually in recent fiscal years, providing multi-year revenue visibility for prime contractors. This supports substantial funded backlogs at companies such as Lockheed Martin LMT, which exited 2025 with a record $194 billion backlog and RTX, which reported a $268 billion backlog, signaling extended revenue streams. LMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nBeyond aerospace and defense, electrification and grid modernization remain powerful structural drivers. Companies such as Eaton and Siemens continue to highlight data center power demand, transmission upgrades and energy transition investments as key growth catalysts. Collectively, these factors provide tangible backlog visibility and earnings support heading into mid-2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-potential-steel-aluminum-rollback-would-be-latest-tariff-reversal-amid-broader-affordability-push-185956950.html",
      "Content": "A significant tariff concession may be on the horizon, as the Trump administration acknowledged Friday that it could scale back some tariffs on goods containing steel and aluminium.\n\nA Friday report from the Financial Times outlined the White House's plan to reduce tariffs on some products made with the metals, from ovens to drink cans. Trump's team has responded that any decision isn't final, but this potential concession would be the latest among more than half a dozen moves to lower tariffs over the past three months.\n\nThe changes range from a reduction of food tariffs to a deescalation of tensions with trading partners to new tariff plans with exclusions so wide that they are expected to have little impact on consumers' pocketbooks.\n\nThe administration's shift in its tariff approach has been apparent since last November, when affordability emerged as a potent political issue that led to Republican election losses that month.\n\nAnd these moves have already had some apparent effects. Friday's cooler-than-expected inflation reading saw some politically sensitive food prices in decline.\n\nThe price of coffee — a key area of White House focus — fell 0.9% between December and January. Similarly in focus have been prices for beef and veal, with those prices down by 0.4% over the same stretch. That came as the overall Consumer Price Index showed a price increase of 0.2% in January from a month earlier.\n\nRead more: January CPI breakdown: Gas prices ease, housing costs remain elevated\n\nThe move also comes as a political backlash to tariffs is evident, even among Republicans. Earlier this week, six GOP lawmakers crossed party lines to reject Trump's tariffs on Canada.\n\n\"This may be an indication that President Trump's trade policy is moving into a new, more nuanced phase,\" international trade lawyer Ted Murphy of the firm Sidley Austin wrote in a note to Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\nMurphy added that an initial tariff phase — defined in his view by big tariffs, quickly imposed — is being gradually replaced by a recognition \"that, at least in some cases, expanding tariffs may actually do more harm than good.\"\n\nA possible action on some steel and aluminium tariffs would represent perhaps the sharpest pivot yet.\n\nSteel and aluminum tariffs have been a priority for Trump stretching back to his first term and were some of the earliest new tariffs announced last year when he returned to office. Trump team visits to US steel plants that they say are being bolstered by these tariffs have also become a regular feature of administration travel.\n\nThe response on Friday from the Trump administration was largely to downplay the move.\n\nIn a CNBC appearance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent didn't deny that some changes could be in the works, but said it remains up to Trump and described the potential changes as \"clarification on some incidental objects.\"\n\nYet a wide array of goods could see price relief if the move goes forward — from washing machines to ovens to pie tins to drink cans — and would quite literally hit home for many consumers.\n\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\n\nFriday's news came after months where the White House has offered a variety of step-backs around tariffs, all in apparent concessions to affordability worries.\n\nOn Nov. 14, grocery store tariff carve-outs were announced, including exclusions on a wide array of agricultural tariffs on items from beef to coffee to pineapples.\n\nThat was followed by tariff reductions on goods from specific countries. Brazilian food products also saw significant new exclusions in November after Trump had imposed 50% tariffs on imports.\n\nThe administration has also downplayed tensions with China in recent months ahead of an April summit. Recent months have also seen a deal with India, which cut many tariffs from 50 to 18% across a range of goods. A new deal with Taiwan , which also saw some lower duties, was announced this week.\n\nElsewhere, long-promised tariffs were revealed to be less than initially promised.\n\nTrump unveiled semiconductor tariffs in January that were notable for their limited scope , with exclusions for entire companies and chips earmarked for internal US consumption.\n\nThat means most consumer electronics — from Apple's iPhone on down — have often managed to dodge tariffs so far in Trump's second term, diminishing expectations that any change there is forthcoming.\n\nIt has been a similar story with pharmaceutical tariffs. Initial promises of 100% or higher tariffs on those goods have been replaced in recent months with a drug pricing deal that has ensured major drugmakers are excluded from tariffs, likely for the next three years.\n\nBen Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

Big tech plans over $700B in AI infrastructure spending for 2026.\n\nWestern Digital (WDC) surged 466% over the past year while Seagate (STX) jumped 2.5% on memory chip shortages driving industry momentum.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nIt won't come as much of a surprise if you have been closely watching the market that shares of Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) climbed 4% over the past week, coinciding with a noticeable shift in retail investor sentiment on platforms like Reddit and X from neutral to very bullish. The memory chip maker has surged 338% over the past year, driven by AI infrastructure demand and persistent supply shortages that are pushing memory prices sharply higher. Micron's 57% year-over-year revenue growth and 28.1% profit margin reflect how tight supply and surging AI demand are creating a perfect storm for memory manufacturers.\n\nMentions of Micron on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets have surged recently, with users sharing bullish commentary and massive-gain posts. Sentiment jumped from 32 (bearish) on February 10 to 88 (very bullish) by February 13, a remarkable reversal that followed Morgan Stanley raising its price target from $350 to $450.

The broader data storage industry is experiencing explosive growth as global memory chip shortages drive prices higher. Western Digital ( NASDAQ:WDC ) has surged 466% over the past year, while Seagate Technology ( NASDAQ:STX ) jumped 2.5% on positive industry outlooks. Morgan Stanley notes that DRAM prices could double from current levels while still remaining below spot prices, signaling how constrained supply has become. For investors watching the AI infrastructure buildout, memory manufacturers like Micron are positioned at the center of a massive spending wave that shows no signs of slowing.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

      "Content": "Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) reported positive free cash flow (FCF) for the latest quarter ending Jan. 24, 2026, albeit lower than last year. Nevertheless, its FCF margin is still strong, and despite higher capex, management's guidance was for higher earnings.\n\nAs a result, analysts have higher target prices for CSCO stock. For example, Yahoo! Finance now reports that the average of 26 analysts' price targets is $87.86. That's 14% higher than today's price.\n\nDespite a Blistering Start to the New Year, the Smart Money is Still Riding with Intel (INTC) Stock\n\nExxon Mobil’s Options Heat Up—31 Unusually Active Contracts Signal Key Trading Setups\n\nOXY Earnings Play: Using Puts to Get Paid While You Wait\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nCSCO is trading at $76.87 , down from a recent peak of $86.78 on Feb. 9, just before the Feb. 11 earnings release.\n\nBased on its strong FCF and FCF margins, despite higher AI-related investments and capital expenditures (capex), Cisco Systems' stock has good upside. This article will show why and a conservative way to play CSCO.\n\nCisco reported that its fiscal Q2 revenue (ending Jan. 24, 2026) was up 10.3% to $15.3 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) rose faster, +11%.\n\nHowever, its operating cash flow (OCF), which includes all cash flow before capital expenditures (capex), was down from $2.24 billion last year to $1.82 billion.\n\nNevertheless, that still represented 11.8% of its quarterly revenue, albeit lower than last year's 16 OCF margin and 21.% in the prior quarter. This can be seen on page 17 of its slide deck:\n\nHowever, after higher capex spending, its Q2 FCF was $1.539 billion (10.0% of revenue) compared to $2.03 billion last year (14.5% FCF margin), according to Stock Analysis.\n\nMoreover, over the trailing 12 months (TTM), its FCF was still strong ($12.24 billion), representing 20.73% of TTM revenue. That was down less from the prior year's 23.6% FCF margin.\n\nAs a result, based on management's higher revenue forecasts for this year, we can expect that FCF could be higher over the next 12 months (NTM).\n\nFor example, management guided that this year it expects revenue to range between $61.2 billion and $61.7 billion (see page 4 of its earnings release). The midpoint of $61.45 billion is 8.5% higher than last year's $56.65 billion revenue.\n\nIn fact, analysts' forecasts are higher. Seeking Alpha shows that 19 analysts project $61.56 billion for the year ending July 2026, and $64.93 billion for the following fiscal year. That implies that over the next 12 months (NTM) revenue could rise to $63.245 billion , up 11.64% over FY 2025.\n\nAs a result, if we assume that Cisco Systems could maintain around 21% FCF margin (slightly higher than its TTM 20.73% margin), FCF could rise to almost $13.3 billion:\n\n$63.245 billion NTM revenue x 0.21 = $13.28 billion NTM FCF\n\nThat would be over $1 billion higher than its LTM FCF of $12.24 billion, or +8.5%.\n\nAs a result, CSCO's value over the next 12 months (NTM) could be higher. Here's why.\n\nRight now, Cisco's stock has a market capitalization of $302.456 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance. As a result, its FCF yield on a trailing 12-month (TTM) basis is just over 4%:\n\n$12.24b TTM FCF / $302.456 b mkt cap = 0.0405 = 4.05% FCF yield\n\nAssuming its FCF yield improves to 4.0% over the next 12 months, the market value could rise to $332 billion:\n\n$13.28 NTM FCF / 0.04 = $332 billion NTM mkt cap\n\nThat's $30 billion higher than todays mkt cap or about 10% higher.\n\nIn other words, even before share buybacks, which have been strong at Cisco, its price target (PT) is 10% higher:\n\n$76.87 x 1.10 = $84.56 PT (i.e., +10%)\n\nThat is even lower than Yahoo! Finance's survey PT of $87.86, and Barchart's mean survey PT of $87.15 per share. Moreover, 18 analysts surveyed by AnaChart.com, which tracks recent analyst write-ups, show an average PT of $98.23. These surveys average $91.06 , or +18.5% higher.\n\nThe bottom line is that CSCO stock could be worth between 10% to 18.5% more than today's price.\n\nOne way to conservatively play this is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in one-month expiration periods. That way, an investor can get paid while setting a potential lower buy-in point.\n\nFor example, look at the March 20, 2026, expiration period. It shows that the $72.50 strike price put, over 5% lower than today's price, has a midpoint premium of $0.87 per put contract.\n\nThat means a short-seller can make $87 immediately after securing $7,250 with their brokerage firm and placing a “Sell to Open” trade order for this contract.\n\nThat represents a one-month yield of 1.20% (i.e., $87/$7,250). The worst that can happen is CSCO falls to $72.50 or lower, and the collateral is used to buy 100 shares at that price.\n\nThis could result in an unrealized capital loss. But the breakeven point is $71.63 (i.e., $72.50-$0.87), which is 6.8% lower than today's price. So, it provides a good potential entry point.\n\nMoreover, less risk-averse investors could use the premium to help buy longer-dated in-the-money (ITM) CSCO call options. That way, they can gain upside in CSCO stock that is potentially greater than buying CSCO shares. I have discussed this in other articles.\n\nThe bottom line is that Cisco Systems' stock looks cheap here, and shorting OTM puts and buying ITM calls are conservative ways to play CSCO.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AMD.\n\nIs AMD fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nGil Luria, an analyst, noted that the company's caution has nothing to do with AMD's overall business, which is still strong in consumer and server CPUs. Instead, the worry is about AMD's ability to compete in the rapidly rising market for artificial intelligence accelerators.\n\nLuria said that performance at scale depended on more than just chip characteristics, even if AMD's Instinct MI300 GPUs seem to do well on technical benchmarks. Nvidia is ahead of the game when it comes to sophisticated networking, software integration, and ecosystem support, which are all things that large AI training clusters need.\n\nThe expert said that AMD was behind in AI accelerators and that big AI developers still relied largely on Nvidia systems for heavy workloads.\n\nEven if the company is neutral, the overall mood on Wall Street is still favorable, and many analysts still give AMD buy recommendations because they think the company has a lot of room to develop in the long run.",

      "Content": "In August, I predicted that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) would reach at least $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030. But Netflix is down 38.6% from its 52-week high at the time of this writing, while Oracle has fallen a staggering 56.5%.\n\nNetflix's market cap is now just $346.9 billion as I write this, and Oracle is at $410.4 billion -- a far cry from joining Nvidia , Alphabet , Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Broadcom , Meta Platforms , Tesla , Berkshire Hathaway , and Walmart on the list of U.S. companies with at least $1 trillion in market cap.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nHere's why both growth stocks are under pressure, and if they are still buys now.\n\nLike many software stocks, Oracle is undergoing a steep sell-off as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts the once seemingly intractable moat of the software-as-a-service business model. But Oracle's investments are mainly centered around building out data centers for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), as well as multicloud data centers that embed its database service into third-party clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.\n\nThe market has become (rightfully) more skeptical about capital-intensive AI spending. Especially for companies like Oracle that are depending heavily on a handful of customers to fulfill order volume.\n\nOracle exited its most recent quarter with $99.98 billion in notes payable and other non-current borrowings (basically long-term debt) compared to just $19.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOn Feb. 1, Oracle announced a plan to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in gross cash proceeds in calendar year 2026 to fund the rapid expansion of OCI and meet contractual demand from companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , Meta Platforms, TikTok, and xAI. The funding will come from a mix of selling at-the-market equity, convertible preferred securities, and bonds. None of these options is good, as the interest rate won't be ideal on the bonds, and Oracle's stock price is already so beaten down.\n\nTaking on debt isn't the worst thing in the world if a company is generating enough cash flow to pay it off. But Oracle reported negative $13.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the second quarter of its fiscal 2026 compared to $9.5 billion in FCF in the same quarter from a year ago. Oracle has gone from being a high-margin cash cow to a capital-intensive money pit while it expands OCI. And that has investors worried that Oracle is betting too big on AI.\n\nThe silver lining is that spending should decline in the coming years as Oracle's capital expenditures decrease and it starts realizing revenue from its backlog. But the company is highly vulnerable to a slowdown in AI spending.\n\nIf Oracle comes even remotely close to its forecast for $144 billion in fiscal 2031 (calendar year 2030) OCI revenue, the company will likely be worth far more than $1 trillion. But it could also continue underperforming the broader indexes if it doesn't get its balance sheet under control.\n\nUnlike Oracle, which has legitimate issues challenging its investment thesis, Netflix is selling off mainly for valuation concerns and mixed reactions to its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) .\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix's valuation has come down significantly since the stock peaked at a split-adjusted intraday high of $134.12 on June 30, 2025.\n\nTrading at just 26.3 times forward earnings, Netflix is within striking distance of the S&P 500 's forward P/E of 23.6. But Netflix is a far better company than the typical S&P 500 component.\n\nNetflix generates high margins and is growing at a solid rate. The company's cash flow means it can fund its content spending without relying on debt, giving it a clear runway for compounding over time.\n\nNetflix has had tons of success with both live-action and animated series and movies, from Stranger Things to its most successful film ever, KPop Demon Hunters .\n\nAdding Warner Bros. Discovery assets would broaden Netflix's content suite and allow it to pair HBO and HBO Max programming as a dual offering with Netflix or simply bundle it into a high-octane streaming subscription.\n\nWarner Bros. is a smart acquisition, but Netflix doesn't need it to succeed. Which is why the stock is still a buy even if the deal falls through.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) have struggled so far this year, with the stock down more than 18% year-to-date (YTD) and nearly 32% below its 52-week high. Despite the significant pullback, unfavorable industry dynamics around memory supply could weigh on QCOM’s earnings. With sentiment already negative, the possibility of the stock revisiting its two-year low of $120.80 cannot be ruled out.\n\nQualcomm delivered better-than-expected Q1 financial numbers. Revenue of $12.3 billion rose 5% YoY and slightly exceeded consensus expectations, reflecting steady demand across key end markets. The Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) segment delivered $1.6 billion in revenue with a strong EBT margin, supported by higher unit volumes and a favorable product mix.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nThe core Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) business posted revenue of $10.6 billion, driven by demand across smartphones, automotive, and IoT markets. Handset revenues within QCT climbed to a record $7.8 billion, benefiting from the launch cycle of premium flagship devices. IoT revenue grew 9% YoY to $1.7 billion, driven by consumer and networking applications, while automotive revenue reached $1.1 billion, up 15%, as adoption of Snapdragon Digital Chassis platforms accelerated.\n\nIts adjusted EPS of $3.50 rose 3% YoY and surpassed expectations.\n\nThe market’s negative reaction to QCOM stock reflects management’s weak guidance. Management guided for second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.45 to $2.65, both below Wall Street expectations. This raised concerns that near-term headwinds will likely weigh on its growth.\n\nThe most significant challenge impacting Qualcomm's growth is the uncertainty in global memory markets. Surging demand for memory solutions, led by AI data centers, has diverted supply away from smartphones, driving higher prices for handset manufacturers. This has been especially disruptive in China, where OEMs are responding by scaling back production plans and tightening inventory management.\n\nWhile Qualcomm maintains that the fundamental demand environment for handsets remains intact, highlighting better-than-expected global shipments in the December quarter and a strong Snapdragon design win pipeline, the near-term outlook remains cautious. OEMs are adjusting build plans downward to manage cost pressures, and Qualcomm is seeing reduced chipset orders as a result.\n\nFor the second quarter, Qualcomm forecasts QCT handset revenues of $6 billion, reflecting a sharp sequential decline. While management expects QCT handset revenues to return to their prior growth trajectory once memory supply and pricing normalize. However, until visibility into memory availability improves and OEM production plans stabilize, Qualcomm’s earnings may remain under pressure. That uncertainty helps explain why the shares have continued to slide despite solid underlying execution.\n\nWhile the company’s handset revenues could continue to face near-term pressure, management has pointed to meaningful strength in other businesses.\n\nQualcomm’s QCT IoT revenue is projected to grow by a low teens percentage YoY. That growth will likely be driven by expanding demand across both industrial and consumer IoT applications. Further, the momentum in the QCT automotive business will be sustained. Qualcomm anticipates YoY revenue growth accelerating to more than 35% in the second fiscal quarter.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, QCOM stock appears inexpensive at 16.3 times forward earnings. However, that multiple fails to attract. Analysts expect QCOM’s earnings to decline 14.7% in fiscal 2026, and there is still limited visibility into a meaningful reacceleration in fiscal 2027. With handset revenues under pressure and earnings momentum weakening, Qualcomm's stock could still remain under pressure.\n\nAnalysts maintain a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating on QCOM stock. However, if memory constraints persist longer than expected, the risk of Qualcomm shares drifting toward their two-year low increases.\n\nOn the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Read more here .\n\nThe AI infrastructure arms race has reached a staggering scale. Hyperscalers are collectively pouring approximately $700 billion into AI CapEx in 2026. Amazon ( Nasdaq: AMZN) just announced $200 billion in planned spend, Alphabet ( Nasdaq: GOOGL ) is projected $185, Meta Platforms ( Nasdaq: META ) up to $135 billion, and Microsoft will reveal an updated capex target closer to summer.\n\nThat kind of spending makes it \"hard to bet against Nvidia,\" as one analyst put it. But here's the paradox: Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) stock has struggled despite this thesis, up just 0.24% year-to-date while the broader AI infrastructure buildout accelerates. Let's explore what's going on and why stocks like Broadcom ( Nasdaq: AVGO ), Micron ( Nasdaq: MU ), and Bloom Energy ( Nasdaq: BE ) have seen stronger recent gains.\n\nHyperscaler spending is concentrated among the mega-cap tech giants. Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon are deploying massive capital into AI infrastructure and cloud computing, with Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's AWS competing for AI workload dominance. Together, these hyperscalers are funding the largest technology infrastructure expansion in history.\n\nSecondary spending comes from 'neoclouds' like CoreWeave and Nebius , while other projects like sovereign AI data centers add even more fuel to the rapidly growing spending pie.\n\nNvidia should be the obvious winner. The company has seen explosive Data Center growth, with AI revenue exponentially growing across training and inference. Yet the stock trades at $186.94, essentially flat for the year. The market seems to be pricing in execution risk or questioning whether $700 billion in CapEx translates to sustained GPU demand beyond the initial buildout phase.\n\nPersonally, I'm betting this is a mistake on Wall Street's part. NVIDIA is my largest personal position, and I own it in the $500,000 portfolio I manage as part of 24/7 Wall Street's AI Investor Podcast. Since we first recommended a buy of NVIDIA on 9/12/2024, shares are up 55%. That's a healthy return in a year and a half for stock that was considered 'overbought' at the time by most of the media.\n\nStill, you might be wondering what other stocks benefit from this $700 billion buildout beyond NVIDIA. Here are some stocks to consider.\n\nThe $700 billion wave creates opportunities across the entire supply chain. These picks-and-shovels plays are seeing explosive growth as AI infrastructure spending accelerates.\n\nBroadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ) is capturing custom chip demand, with strong AI semiconductor revenue growth driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. The stock is up 41% over the past year. We first recommended it in the $500,000 Portfolio on October 11, 2024 and later re-recommended it. Both recommendations are up more than 80%.\n\nBroadcom shares are down 4% year-to-date despite its primary customer Google announcing $185 billion in capex, a number that was more than 50% above analyst expectations.\n\nOptical components are seeing explosive growth. Lumentum ( NASDAQ:LITE ) has seen strong data center and long-haul momentum, with optical circuit switches and co-packaged optics as next growth engines. The stock has surged 637% over the past year.\n\nWe first recommended it in the AI Portfolio on 11/8/2024 and shares are up 590% since. We've pounded the table since, such as when we brought on an optics expert on our March 28th episode last year titled 'These Optical Stocks Could Be Set to Ride an Optical Supercycle.'\n\nMemory is another winner. Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) has seen AI memory demand driving record results as the only US-based memory manufacturer. The stock is up 353% over the past year. Once again, we recommended Micron before its most significant gains. Our January 17th recommendation last year is now up 292%.\n\nPower infrastructure plays are emerging. Bloom Energy ( NYSE:BE ) has seen strong momentum addressing AI data center power demands, with product backlog growing significantly. The stock has jumped 492% over the past year. Bloom Energy isn't a stock we've recommended in our $500,000 AI Portfolio, but it could make the cut when we record our next episode.\n\nIf you're looking for other stocks that could benefit from the $700 billion buildout, make sure to subscribe to the AI Investor Podcast.

This decrease was primarily attributed to a higher mix of hardware sales.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins also fell 150 basis points sequentially to 40.2%, driven by a $16 million increase in operating expenses due to the expansion of the R&D organization, including the aiXscale acquisition.\n\nALAB’s shares have also plunged 33.6% in the trailing six-month period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 10.3% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of 20.3% over the same time frame. The underperformance can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition in the PCIe retimers market.\n\nHowever, the company is benefiting from its robust and diversified product portfolio to address the growing demands of AI infrastructure and connectivity solutions, as well as its expanding partner base. It benefits from strong demand for its PCIe solutions, which have also been a major growth driver.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ product portfolio, including Scorpio, Aries, and Taurus, has been a key catalyst. In the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB started increasing production of its Scorpio X-Series lead platform.\n\nThe company also expanded the Smart Fabric Switch roadmap with hyperscaler partners, adding new features to meet the needs of next-generation scale-up networking. Early interest from customers is pushing more investment into the quickly growing merchant scale-up switching market, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB expanded its product portfolio with custom NVLink Fusion connectivity solutions designed with hyperscaler partners to optimize heterogeneous AI infrastructure performance, improve energy efficiency, and reduce cost across diverse next-generation AI workloads.\n\nALAB’s expanding portfolio underpins the company’s expectation that its served addressable market opportunity will expand by more than 10x over the next five years to reach $25 billion. This growth is expected to be driven by its copper-based product families, including Aries and Taurus signal conditioning solutions, Scorpio AI fabric switches, Leo CXL Memory Controllers, and custom solutions for scale-up connectivity.\n\nAster Lab is benefiting from strong demand for its Aries, Taurus, and Scorpio product families, all of which are expected to drive growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAstera Labs expects first-quarter 2026 revenues between $286 million and $297 million. Earnings are expected to be between 53 cents and 54 cents per share for the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure calls for a year-over-year increase of 57.58%.\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Astera Labs, Inc. Quote\n\nDespite an expanding portfolio and strong partner base, ALAB is facing stiff competition from other industry players like Marvell Technology MRVL, Credo Technology CRDO, and Broadcom AVGO in the connectivity space.\n\nMarvell Technology is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. Marvell Technology recently completed its acquisition of Celestial AI, strengthening its scale-up optical connectivity capabilities for large-scale AI deployments.\n\nCredo Technology is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market with a healthy pipeline of PCIe Gen6 AECs and retimers, with further customer wins expected to support fiscal 2026 growth. Credo Technology’s shares have rallied 3.8% in the trailing six-month period.\n\nBroadcom is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market by developing advanced solutions that enhance signal quality and extend the reach of PCIe connections in high-speed data environments. Broadcom shares have surged 50.3% in the trailing 12-month period.\n\nAstera Labs’ stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 17.67X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.51X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ strong fundamentals, expanding partnerships, and rising AI demand reinforce its leadership in connectivity solutions. However, challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition remain a headwind. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.\n\nAstera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

      "Content": "After some share-price ups and downs, Cisco Systems (CSCO) now trades at a fairly reasonable 21.44 times historic earnings.\n\nCisco reported a respectable 10% year-on-year net income gain in Q2 FY2026.\n\nCSCO stock should have a clear path to $150, but keep an eye on Cisco’s expenditures.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nSometimes favored but other times reviled, Cisco Systems ( NASDAQ:CSCO ) is a technology firm that never ceases to garner interest. Cisco stock is always in motion, but the burning question is whether the share price will be higher or lower in five years' time.\n\nAt the very least, bulls and bears must concede that Cisco has come a long way since the dot-com-era days. Today, Cisco is a strong networking/communications technology market contender that's deeply immersed in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe pessimists might declare that Cisco peaked in the dot-com days, but that's an overly harsh assessment. Frankly, it's fine that some folks underestimate Cisco as this leaves the door open to significantly higher share prices in the coming years.\n\nOver the past year and a half, CSCO stock has been on a rocket ride that undoubtedly put some short sellers out of commission. There's been a recent price pullback which we'll discuss in a moment, but overall, the momentum has been decidedly to the upside.\n\nIt's probably a good thing that Cisco stock dipped from $85 to $75 as this will allow for some digestion of the gains. Notably, Cisco's trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 21.44x, which is 8.43% below the sector average.\n\nTo put it another way, Cisco appears to be reasonably valued and you don't have to worry about buying at the top now. On its multi-year trajectory, CSCO stock has the potential to double to $150 in five years -- and wouldn't you rather get in at $75 than at $85?\n\nBy the way, Cisco stock also happens to pay a decent dividend for a large-cap technology stock. At the moment, Cisco's forward annual dividend yield is nearly 2%, and our five-year share-price forecast doesn't include the dividend-reinvestment opportunities.\n\nThe naysayers can complain about a CSCO stock \"rug pull\" from $85 to $75 if they want to. Yet, it's really an opportunity instead of a problem if Cisco is doing well from a financial standpoint.\n\nIndeed, value seekers ought to consider it positive news that Cisco stock sank despite perfectly good financial results. Consider, for example, that Cisco grew its second-quarter fiscal 2026 revenue by 10% to $15.3 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, Cisco's management projects current-quarter revenue in the range of $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion. Thus, the $15.3 net revenue recorded in the second fiscal quarter probably wasn't just a fluke.\n\nTurning to the bottom-line results, Cisco's Q2 FY2026 non-GAAP net income increased 10% year over year to $4.1 billion. It looks even better if we use GAAP measurements and then observe that Cisco's net income grew 31% to $3.2 billion.\n\nThere's nothing objectionable in Cisco's headline numbers, so it's the bears' burden to explain why CSCO stock shouldn't at least hit $150 in five years. Moreover, Cisco is upping the ante in AI integration with its recent acquisitions of enterprise AI platform company NeuralFabric Corp. and AI software business EzDubs, Inc.\n\nRemember, the market will find excuses to rotate out of stocks temporarily even if the companies are in good shape. Technology stocks have been shaky lately, but that's not a Cisco-specific problem. If and when the market collectively decides to buy NASDAQ 100 stocks again, Cisco stock should move higher.\n\nIf there's a topic that investors ought to pay more attention to, it's financial outlays. Too much time is spent on revenue growth and not enough is spent on cost controls.\n\nWe can use Cisco's Q2 FY2026 data as an example of what investors need to keep tabs on. Sure, Cisco's revenue and income grew substantially on a year-over-year basis, but it's important to watch out for what I call \"expenses creep.\"\n\nIn this day and age, technology firms' financial outlays on AI technology continue to creep higher, quarter after quarter and year after year. That's fine as long as revenue growth continues at its current pace for these companies.\n\nChecking in on Cisco during the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company's GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year over year to $6.2 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, those expenses grew 6% to $5 billion.\n\nThis isn't a cause for panic right now, but it's definitely something to monitor closely. If Cisco starts to creep up its expenditures into the double digits, the shareholders should call for better fiscal discipline.\n\nSo, feel free to keep track of Cisco's operating expenses to make sure that the AI arms race isn't too costly for this company. That said, the upside potential remains strong for CSCO stock and unless circumstances change drastically, a five-year price target of $150 is absolutely attainable.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

This includes a roughly 13% gain over the past week.\n\nLooking at slightly longer periods, GlobalFoundries has returned about 18% over the past month and 47% over the past 3 months, inviting closer scrutiny of what is currently priced into the shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for GlobalFoundries.\n\nThat recent momentum sits within a mixed track record, with a 32.09% year to date share price return and a 12.84% 1 year total shareholder return, contrasted against a 27.49% 3 year total shareholder return decline.\n\nIf GlobalFoundries has you thinking about where else chip related trends might show up, it could be worth scanning 34 AI infrastructure stocks as a starting point for other ideas.\n\nSo, with recent gains, analyst targets close by and mixed longer term returns, is GlobalFoundries still offering value, or are you looking at a stock where the market is already pricing in future growth?\n\nGlobalFoundries’ most followed valuation narrative puts fair value at about $40.28, which sits well below the recent $48.70 share price, so the story behind that gap matters.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\n\nWant to see what kind of revenue build, margin lift and future earnings multiple have to come together to support that fair value gap?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etfs-gain-us-taiwan-sign-151700576.html",
      "Content": "The landmark trade agreement signed between the United States and Taiwan on Feb. 12, 2026, has ignited a new wave of optimism for the island&rsquo;s industrial powerhouses. By reducing reciprocal tariffs from 20% to 15%, the deal directly lowers the cost of entry for Taiwanese high-tech exports &mdash; particularly semiconductors, generic pharmaceuticals and aircraft parts &mdash; into the world&rsquo;s largest economy.\n\nThis reduction effectively places Taiwan on a \"fair footing\" with other Asian allies like Japan and South Korea, removing the competitive disadvantage previously caused by \"Trump-era\" reciprocal duties.\n\nFor investors, this pivotal deal creates a significant tailwind for Taiwanese giants like Taiwan Semiconductor TSM and, by extension, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that hold heavy concentrations of them, as these companies remain poised for margin expansion and increased shipment volumes in the days ahead.\n\nBy holding a diversified basket of these firms, ETFs offer a direct route to capitalize on this improved competitive landscape without the risk of picking individual stocks.\n\nBefore suggesting these ETFs for your portfolio, let us delve a little deeper into the specifics of this trade deal and the prospects for Taiwanese companies, so you can make a more informed investment decision.\n\nThe U.S.-Taiwan relationship is far from simple, operating within a complex geopolitical framework.\n\nAs the United States steadily pushes for a &ldquo;Silicon Shield&rdquo; by reshoring 40% of the semiconductor supply chain to its shores, Taiwan leverages its dominance in AI hardware to secure more favorable trade terms.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the agreement effectively codifies the mutual dependency between the two nations, with the United States lowering trade barriers in exchange for Taiwan deepening its critical technology investments in America.\n\nThe deal includes an $84 billion commitment from Taiwan to purchase U.S. goods &mdash; including LNG, crude oil and aircraft &mdash; between 2025 and 2029, along with a $250 billion investment pledge by Taiwanese firms into U.S. manufacturing. Taiwan has also pledged to remove or reduce 99% of tariff barriers on U.S. goods, as well as provide &ldquo;preferential market access&rdquo; for U.S. exports, including autos, beef products and minerals (as per a CNBC press release).\n\nThis \"reciprocal trade\" framework, while aimed at narrowing the U.S. trade deficit, will add impetus to the booming Taiwanese economy by fueling the insatiable global demand for AI.\n\nBolstered by this deal, Taiwan&rsquo;s economy, which grew 8.6% in 2025, is expected to maintain its momentum despite global \"AI bubble\" fears. According to Fortune, this growth was largely fueled by a 78% surge in exports to the United States, backed by ballooning AI demand.\n\nNow that the tariff is reduced, more export volumes are expected to be registered this year, which should help Taiwanese \"enablers\" capture efficiency gains in the coming days.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, for those looking to capitalize on this transformation, the following ETFs offer the most direct exposure:\n\niShares MSCI Taiwan ETF EWT\n\nThis fund, with net assets worth $8.15 billion, offers exposure to 88 large and mid-sized companies in Taiwan. Its top three holdings include TSM (24.66%), Mediatek (4.72%) and Hon Hai Precision Industry HNHPF (4.56%).\n\nEWT has surged 37.5% over the past year. The fund charges 59 basis points (bps) as fees. It traded at a good volume of 6.98 million shares in the last trading session.\n\nFranklin FTSE Taiwan ETF FLTW\n\nThis fund, with net assets worth $706.3 million, offers exposure to 130 Taiwan large and mid-capitalization stocks. Its top three holdings include TSM (22.09%), HNHPF (6.35%) and Mediatek (6.25%).\n\nFLTW has soared 46.2% over the past year. The fund charges 19 bps as fees. It traded at a volume of 0.49 million shares in the last trading session.\n\nFidelity Emerging Markets Multifactor ETF FDEM\n\nThis fund, with net assets worth $448.1 million, offers exposure to 250 stocks of large and mid-capitalization emerging markets companies that have attractive valuations, high quality profiles, positive momentum signals, lower volatility than the broader emerging markets equity market, and lower correlation to the U.S. equity market. TSM holds the first position in this fund, with 10.30% weightage.\n\nFDEM has gained 30.6% over the past year. The fund charges 28 bps as fees. It traded at a volume of 0.20 million shares in the last trading session.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "ASML Holding ASML shares have surged 11.3% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 3.4%. ASML stock has also outperformed its peers, namely Lam Research LRCX and KLA Corporation KLAC, while underperforming Applied Materials AMAT in the same time frame.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of Lam Research, KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have returned 10.8%, 1.1% and 19.1%, respectively. This surge in stock price has also made ASML stock overvalued. ASML stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 12.66X compared with the sector average of 6.37X, which makes it overvalued at present, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of F.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow the question remains: Should the investors buy, sell or hold shares of this semiconductor manufacturing equipment player?\n\nSustained demand for artificial intelligence and high performance computing chips by global data centers, AI labs and hyperscalers has reinforced ASML’s long-term growth outlook as the company provides extreme ultraviolet (EUV) semiconductor lithography tools to chip manufacturers that enable them to accelerate capacity expansion.\n\nASML’s management on the fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call noted that ASML’s customers have become more confident about medium-term AI demand, leading to stronger order intake and investment plans as chipmakers transition from 4-nanometer to 3-nanometer and prepare for the 2-nanometer transition.\n\nAs EUV intensity per wafer continues to rise, AI and HPC workloads are addressed more efficiently. In memory, robust demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced DRAM nodes is expected to tighten supply through at least 2026, further supporting EUV demand.\n\nASML is also benefiting from a growing installed base, which is driving high-margin service and upgrade revenues as customers increasingly view upgrades as the fastest way to add capacity. With a €38.8 billion backlog and reaffirmed long-term targets, ASML remains well-positioned to capitalize on the AI-led semiconductor investment cycle.\n\nFor 2026, ASML expects its revenues in the range of €34-€39 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2026 revenues is pegged at $43.31 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 17%.\n\nAlthough ASML faces competitive pressure from players like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA Corporation in the broader wafer equipment manufacturing market, ASML holds a near-monopoly in EUV technology.\n\nEUV is crucial for the world’s most advanced chips at 3nm and below; it benefits from extraordinary pricing power and strategic importance with major customers like TSMC, Samsung and Intel.\n\nASML’s venture into sub-2nm production with High Numerical Aperture (High-NA) EUV systems is the next technological leap for chipmakers. This technology will provide ASML with long-term potential as the industry moves toward denser and more efficient chips. ASML’s High-NA machines will be central to that shift.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2026 earnings is pegged at $33.63, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 20.3%. The consensus estimate has been revised upward in the past seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nASML’s unmatched EUV leadership, AI-driven demand visibility, and strong earnings momentum support a long-term bullish view, making this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock attractive at present.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\n\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\n\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\n\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\n\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\n\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\n\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target.

      "Title": "Is It Worth Investing in Analog Devices (ADI) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-analog-devices-adi-143004519.html",
      "Content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.52 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.7% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Analog Devices, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.9% over the past month to $9.97.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices.

      "Content": "Investing.com -- D.A. Davidson initiated coverage of four major semiconductor names, AMD, Intel, Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in notes to clients on Thursday, with only one receiving a Buy rating.\n\nAnalyst Gil Luria initiated coverage of the group, pointing to diverging competitive positions.\n\nOn Broadcom , D.A. Davidson stated that the company is “sitting on a shrinking iceberg” as hyperscalers increasingly favour customised accelerators.\n\nThe firm warned that the largest of customers could internalise more of their silicon stack, ultimately “pressuring supplier economics.” Luria believes Broadcom’s AI ASIC exposure does not justify “a premium multiple versus market leaders such as NVIDIA,” initiating the stock at Neutral with a $335 price target.\n\nIntel was also started at Neutral. D.A. Davidson said “it wouldn’t be an overstatement to claim that Intel is attempting one of the hardest resets in semiconductor history,” arguing the company must rebuild leading-edge process capability while proving itself as a third-party foundry.\n\nWhile noting “real developments” in the business, the firm said Intel remains “the ultimate ‘show me’ story,” and set a $45 price target.\n\nAMD received a Neutral rating as well. D.A. Davidson said AMD is “a marginal AI accelerator player … in the act of playing catch-up,” despite strength in CPUs. The firm initiated with a $220 price target.\n\nFinally, TSMC was the lone Buy. Luria said the company’s leading-edge execution represents “a durable, self-reinforcing advantage” as AI compute demand expands. He also highlighted “a compounding execution moat in leading edge manufacturing.” The analyst assigned TSM a $450 price target.\n\nRelated articles\n\nD.A.

      "Content": "Cisco Systems (CSCO) just released an artificial intelligence (AI) networking chip that could reshape how the world's biggest data centers handle AI workloads. The Silicon One G300 delivers 102.4 terabits per second of switching capacity.\n\nThat's more than double what the previous generation could handle. The chip powers new systems designed specifically for massive AI clusters, where thousands of GPUs must constantly communicate.\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nHere's what investors should know about CSCO stock in light of the news.\n\nThe G300 chip tackles AI's biggest infrastructure problem. When training large language models or running AI inference at scale, data must be constantly moved between GPUs. Any delays or dropped packets can stall entire jobs, wasting expensive compute time.\n\nCisco's chip uses something called Intelligent Collective Networking. Think of it as traffic management for data. The chip has an industry-leading buffer that can absorb sudden bursts of traffic without dropping packets. It also continuously monitors the network and reroutes traffic around issues before they cause failures.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Cisco reports that the technology delivers 33% higher network utilization than traditional approaches. Job completion times drop by 28%. That means more AI tokens generated per hour from the same GPU hardware. For companies spending millions on AI infrastructure, those improvements translate directly to better returns on investment.\n\nCisco has built complete systems around the G300 that address AI's power and cooling challenges. The new Cisco N9000 and Cisco 8000 systems come in both liquid-cooled and air-cooled versions. The liquid-cooled systems achieve nearly 70% better energy efficiency. One new system delivers the same bandwidth as six older systems. That matters enormously as data centers struggle with power constraints, fitting more AI capacity in the same physical space while using less energy.\n\nCisco also introduced 1.6 terabit optics and new 800G linear pluggable optics that cut power consumption by 50% compared to older designs. Overall, switch power consumption drops by 30%, improving operational reliability and sustainability.\n\nCisco's management shared compelling numbers during recent investor conferences. The company took in $1.3 billion in AI infrastructure orders during just the first quarter of fiscal 2026. That's from hyperscalers alone. The figure doesn't include sovereign cloud providers, neoclouds, or enterprise customers.\n\nFor fiscal 2026, Cisco expects to take in at least double the $2 billion in AI orders from fiscal 2025, while AI-powered revenue should increase to $3 billion. Even more impressive, Cisco now has design wins at five of the six largest hyperscalers. In Q1 alone, the company won four new design wins across four different hyperscalers. These aren't one-time purchases, as design wins can generate orders for three-plus years. Four hyperscalers increased their orders with Cisco by more than 100% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter. That shows deepening relationships beyond initial trials.\n\nSilicon One gives Cisco real advantages. CFO Mark Patterson called it one of the company's \"most strategic assets.” The chip is also highly programmable. Customers can upgrade equipment with new features even after deployment. That protects long-term infrastructure investments and creates stickiness. Cisco now has a variety of Silicon One product families, covering everything from AI data centers to enterprise networks.\n\nThe hyperscaler business receives the most attention, but Cisco sees significant opportunities elsewhere. For example, the sovereign cloud and neocloud pipeline exceeds $2.5 billion. These customers want AI infrastructure but need local control over their data and operations. Cisco's relationships with partners such as HUMAIN position it well.\n\nEnterprise AI remains early, but could dwarf everything else. Cisco's partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) focuses on simplifying enterprise AI deployment. The companies offer validated reference architectures that remove complexity.\n\nPresident Jeetu Patel noted at Cisco's AI Summit that token generation will become \"one of the core currencies of every company and every country.\" Organizations that can generate AI tokens efficiently and cost-effectively will gain a competitive advantage.\n\nWhile AI grabs headlines, Cisco's campus networking refresh provides steady growth. The company has billions of dollars worth of installed switches approaching the end of support. These older systems pose security risks and can't handle modern AI workloads.\n\nCisco refreshed virtually its entire campus portfolio in June. The new switches incorporate AI and security directly into the fabric. Campus networking orders accelerated in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Adoption of new platforms is happening faster than previous product launches.\n\nThis isn't a one-quarter spike. The campus refresh will unfold over multiple years as enterprises modernize their networks to support AI-powered applications and agile workloads.\n\nCisco generated strong cash flow while investing heavily in AI. The company bought back $2 billion in CSCO stock during Q1 at an average price of $68. That shows management's confidence while returning capital to shareholders.\n\nGross margins held steady at around 68% despite the inclusion of a lower-margin hyperscaler business. The company manages its diverse portfolio to maintain profitability while growing revenue.\n\nOperating expenses are growing more slowly than revenue. Earnings are growing faster than the top line in every recent quarter and in the full-year guidance.\n\nOut of 24 analysts covering Cisco stock, 15 recommend a “Strong Buy,” one recommends a “Moderate Buy,” and eight recommend a “Hold” rating. That makes for a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating. The average CSCO stock price target is $86.90, which represents 16% potential upside from current levels.\n\nThe AI networking opportunity is massive, and Cisco has real technological advantages. Design wins at multiple hyperscalers validate the technology and create multi-year revenue streams.\n\nThe sovereign cloud and enterprise markets are just beginning. As AI moves beyond hyperscalers into broader deployment, Cisco's full-stack approach becomes even more valuable. Cisco's campus refresh also supports steady growth as the company scales its AI infrastructure. Security through Splunk adds another growth vector as customers prioritize protecting AI deployments.\n\nNear-term volatility is possible if AI spending pauses or memory costs spike. But Cisco's diversified business model and strong balance sheet can handle bumps. For investors who can handle some volatility, Cisco offers exposure to AI infrastructure growth at a reasonable valuation with dividend income while you wait.\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU ) stock is trading higher Wednesday after Morgan Stanley reiterated its Overweight rating and boosted its price target from $350 to $450. Here’s what you should know .\n\nAnalyst Joseph Moore pointed to continued DRAM price strength and persistent supply shortages as the main reasons behind the improved outlook, Investing.com reported.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nBefore the IPO: How One Company Quietly Locked Up 500+ Iconic Character Rights\n\nMorgan Stanley noted that mainstream DRAM prices could double again and still remain more than 10% below current spot levels, which continue to trend upward. Contract pricing has already climbed 86% since December, and the firm says buyers who waited too long to secure inventory are now paying close to high teens ASP per GB.\n\nMicron is also preparing to announce a new investment in memory‑chip manufacturing capacity in Singapore, focused on NAND flash production, signaling that the company expects long‑term demand to remain strong, according to the report.\n\nSee Also: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\nMicron Technology has recently received favorable ratings from several analysts, with most maintaining an optimistic outlook. Similarly to Morgan Stanley’s rating, Mizuho kept its Outperform rating, increasing the target from $390 to $480 on Jan. 27.\n\nOther significant rating actions include William Blair initiating coverage with an Outperform rating on Jan. 22. In addition, TD Cowen and Stifel both maintained their Buy ratings on Jan. 20. TD Cowen set a new target of $450, up from $300, while Stifel raised its target from $300 to $360.

      "Content": "「我自己投資台股、美股，長期報酬不是更高嗎？」「而且勞退要等到退休才能領，資金完全被鎖住。」這是多數上班族面對勞退自提 6% 時的第一個疑問。勞退自提 6% 到底是不是一個「一定要做」的選擇？還是其實只適合某些人？\n1. 勞退基金是什麼？自提 6% 是什麼意思？\n依《勞工退休金條例》規定，雇主每月必須為勞工提繳薪資 6%，存入個人退休專戶，由勞動部勞動基金運用局統一管理，屬於個人帳戶制，就算公司倒閉也不影響這筆資金，離職後也仍會持續累積。 在雇主提繳之外，勞工可再自願提繳 1%～6% 的薪資，這就是所謂的「勞退自提」。自提金額不計入當年度薪資所得課稅，即稅前扣除，並設有最低收益保障機制，保證比定存好， 但資金須等符合法定退休條件後才能動用，且投資標的由政府統一運作。因此，自提 6% 的本質，是一種結合稅務優惠與強制儲蓄機制的退休準備工具。\n\n2. 什麼時候可以領？怎麼領？\n\n請領退休金課稅方式\n年滿 60 歲即可請領。年資不同，能選的領法不同：提繳年資滿 15 年以上：可選月領或一次領；未滿 15 年：原則一次領。\n「一次領」與「分期領（月領）」的差別在課稅方式不同。簡單說， 一次領是用「年資」去算免稅門檻，領越多、超過門檻的部分才會被計入所得；分期領則是每年先扣一個固定免稅額，超過的部分才算所得。\n舉例來說，假設工作 30 年退休，並選擇一次領取。免稅額度 = 19.8 萬 x 30 年 = 594 萬元。只要領取的退休金總額沒超過 594 萬元，就不須繳稅；若超過則按照級距有半額課稅或全額課稅的差別。如果選擇每月請領，免稅額度是看全年的請領總額，若不超過 85.9 萬元，則免課稅，一般來說這是不容易達到的課稅門檻。若好奇以目前薪資做自提，在退休後可以領到多少金額可以到 勞動部 網站做試算。\n3. 自提 6% vs 自己投資差在哪？\n我們直接用 2004 年至 2024 年的歷史實際資料來回測。假設每月投資 6,000 元，持續 20 年，分成兩種情境比較：第一種是每月把 6,000 元全額自提進勞退帳戶；第二種是不自提，而是把每月 6,000 元扣除當年度所得稅後的實際可投資金額，定期定額分別投資於台股、美股與美國科技股。\n從結果來看，成長型市場在這 20 年間確實累積出明顯優勢。即使在 40% 高稅率下，美國科技股約 833 萬元，仍高於勞退的 361 萬元，顯示報酬率對最終成果的影響相當關鍵。不過，隨著稅率提高，差距會逐步縮小。以台股為例，5% 稅率下最終約 738 萬元，但 40% 稅率時降至 466 萬元，與勞退 361 萬元的距離明顯拉近。 原因在於稅率越高，稅後可投入的本金越少，自提「完整投入」的優勢便開始浮現。因此，成長型資產決定長期累積速度，而稅率高低則影響起跑點。當稅率達 20% 以上時，自提的節稅優勢逐漸明顯化。\n不過，必須注意股票有崩盤並賠掉本金的風險，而勞退基金依法有「保證收益機制」 ，政府承諾就算勞退基金操盤賠得亂七八糟，最後結算給你的收益，絕對不會低於銀行定存利率。換句話說，這是一筆保證不賠本的投資。\n勞退自提與扣除稅率後投入股市的累積金額相比\n4. 我適合自提 6% 嗎？\n在討論自提之前，更重要的其實是檢視自己的理財習慣。如果單純追求長期報酬最大化，不自提、將扣稅後的資金持續投入高成長股市，理論上確實可能累積出更高的金額。但這個前提包含幾個條件：你能選到合適的標的、未來市場能延續過去的成長趨勢，以及你能在市場波動甚至大幅下跌時，仍然堅持定期定額、不恐慌贖回。此外，還有一個更現實的問題：每個月薪水發下來後，這筆原本打算投資的錢，是否真的會被確實投入，而不是被日常開銷慢慢侵蝕？\n如果你是一位具備良好投資紀律 、能長期執行計畫且能承受波動的投資人， 自行投資確實更具潛在成長空間 。但 如果對自己的執行力沒有那麼有把握 ，或擔心情緒影響決策，那麼 勞退自提的價值就在於把紀律制度化 。薪資尚未入帳即完成提撥，既節稅又強制儲蓄，讓退休準備成為一個穩定、持續的過程。\n再進一步來看， 如果你的適用稅率達 20% 以上 時，自提屬於稅前扣除，節稅效果會隨稅率提高而放大，對高稅率族群而言， 自提的優勢更加明顯 ；若 稅率較低，則節稅效益有限，建議優先建立緊急預備金與基本投資配置 ，再評估是否提高自提比例。\n鉅亨投資策略\n該不該自提 6%？依稅率與紀律做出適合的選擇\n若單純追求長期報酬最大化，自行投資高成長市場通常更具優勢；但若考量稅務效率、強制儲蓄與資產穩定性，自提 6% 仍有其制度價值。第一，先檢視自己的稅率與現金流狀況。第二，評估自身是否具備長期投資紀律與風險承受能力。第三，將自提視為退休配置的一部分，而非全部。成熟的退休規劃，不是二選一，而是在成長與穩定之間取得平衡。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nA20106\n富邦 NASDAQ-100 指數基金 (本基金之配息來源可能為本金及收益平準金)\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "這兩週市場同時遭受 AI 海嘯、利率轉向與政治黑天鵝接連衝擊。美國聯準會立場轉鷹，川普提名前理事華許接掌聯準會主席，加上英國工黨面臨執政危機，以及日本高市早苗政府在大選勝出後，形同獲得一張擴張財政與強硬外交的空白支票。同時，從比特幣到白銀都在上演高台跳水，投資人忽然想起本益比三個字。當股匯債與原物料同步劇烈波動，這波震盪到底是短期情緒，還是新一輪景氣與政策循環的序曲？\n1. 利率與聯準會市場從等降息變成別作夢\n\n鮑爾在一月會議後明確表示經濟明顯改善且就業穩健，等於把上半年降息空間先行封鎖，聯邦基金期貨也乖乖把降息預期往後延。川普拋出凱文華許作為新任聯準會主席提名人選，市場開始重新計算未來利率路徑與美元走勢。降息不再是何時開始，而是會不會比想像中更少。在這種情況下，高估值科技股首當其衝，標普五百與那斯達克連日回檔。避險情緒升高卻無處躲避，連黃金都被追繳保證金的賣壓波及，提醒投資人利率週期尚未轉向。\n\n2. AI 熱潮與科技股從萬能解答變成估值殺手\nAI 依舊是故事主角，但這回是以反派姿態上場。Anthropic 推出新工具後，市場開始認真計算如果 AI 能寫程式、審合約與處理資料，那些靠人力與訂閱服務生存的軟體公司，未來利潤如何支撐股價？結果美國軟體股單日蒸發 2,850 億美元市值。另一邊 SpaceX 收購 xAI，Meta 與甲骨文大舉投入重金建置 AI 基礎設施，說明資本支出仍在加碼，但股價卻因利率與估值承壓。簡單說 AI 長期前景亮眼，短期卻淪為回檔藉口，尤其是漲多的美股科技龍頭。\n3. 地緣政治與政策英日劇烈轉向、川習再度交鋒\n政治局勢完全沒有平息跡象。英國工黨幕僚長請辭，首相史塔默的人事與外交任命陷入風暴，執政穩定性遭質疑，英鎊與英國資產面臨折價風險。相反地日本眾議院選舉讓高市早苗大勝，市場解讀為日本將大開財政大門。擴張財政、國防支出與更鷹派的外交路線，對日股與日債殖利率都是強烈訊號。川普與習近平通話再度把焦點拉回貿易與台海，從大豆、石油到軍事溝通，全都牽動資金對台灣與中國資產的風險溢酬定價。中東方面，美伊在阿曼預備重啟核談，若有進展，能源供給風險可望緩和，但在那之前，油價仍對任何飛彈或談判破局高度敏感。\n4. 資產波動加密貨幣、高貴金屬與飆過頭的銅\n在利率高檔震盪與 AI 泡沫疑慮雙重壓力下，風險資產首先重挫。比特幣單日重挫約一成，白銀一度暴跌兩成，黃金也被拖下水，說明這一輪不是避險買盤，而是去槓桿化。同時前一波在中國投機資金推升下大漲的銅價，也被重新檢驗基本面。中國製造業 PMI 再度掉回預警區間，地方財政與信用風險消息不斷，讓中國需求復甦這個論點顯得底氣不足。相較之下，台灣因 AI 供應鏈帶動，上調成長預測。美日股也在震盪中維持中長期成長趨勢。市場開始用更苛刻但理性的眼光，選擇繼續追求成長或先保留現金。\n鉅亨投資策略\n在震盪中聚焦核心資產，避免盲目進場\n在利率延長賽與 AI 估值修正下，美股、日股與台股因經濟與產業結構具備成長動能，中長期持續看好，但短期需接受劇烈波動，特別是高本益比科技股的修正過程。大宗商品方面，貴金屬與工業金屬近期價格大起大落，既反映槓桿去化，也暴露出市場對全球需求的疑慮，配置上建議相對保守，以避險與分散投資為主，而非短線追價。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nB15112\n富蘭克林坦伯頓 - 日本\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "A highly volatile stock can deliver big gains - or just as easily wipe out a portfolio if things go south.

      "Content": "Got some idle money you're ready to put to work for a while? Is there $1,000 you have available (or any amount, really) that you'd like to turn into something more? That's easier said than done right now. Too many stocks have demonstrated a bit too much vulnerability of late. Another wave of weakness feels possible.\n\nNot every name is uncomfortably risky here, however. Even if the market does get upended again, a few stocks are apt to hold up well enough and then enjoy more than their fair share of any recovery. Here's a rundown of three of these names.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nQualcomm 's (NASDAQ: QCOM) 23% share price pullback from its early January peak makes enough superficial sense. Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\n\nPayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\n\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\n\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\n\nFinally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\n\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "The global semiconductor industry appears to be going through structural tailwinds. Fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, global semiconductor industry annual sales are projected to touch $975 billion in 2026, a historic peak. Furthermore, with sustained growth, annual sales may touch $2 trillion by 2036.\n\nWith that in mind, it's unsurprising that semiconductor stocks have surged higher. While some investors might have missed out on the big rally, there also still seem to be pockets of opportunity left. Amid volatility, shares of STMicroelectronics (STM) have trended 43% higher in the last 52 weeks. This lesser-known chip stock seems to hold significant potential.\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\nPfizer Reports Strong Earnings Outlook - Unusual Call Options Activity Shows Investors are Bullish\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nSTMicroelectronics recently announced a partnership with Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS), and this multi-billion-dollar collaboration underscores the point of scope for value creation. As part of the deal, STM will be a supplier of advanced semiconductor technologies and products to AWS. Further, STM will issue warrants to AWS for up to 24.8 million shares. Besides establishing credibility, this deal is likely to be a top-line growth driver for STMicroelectronics and STM stock.\n\nBased in the Netherlands and headquartered in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics is a designer, developer, and manufacturer of semiconductor products globally. The company’s key business segments include RF & Optical Communications, Analog Products, MEMS & Sensors, Embedded Processing, and Power & Discrete Products. In terms of end users, the automotive, industrial and personal electronics segments are business growth drivers for the company.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, STMicroelectronics reported revenue of $11.8 billion with a gross margin of 33.9%. For the same period, the firm reported free cash flow of $265 million.\n\nWhile STMicroelectronics reported revenue degrowth in fiscal 2025, SMT stock has trended higher by 28% in the last six months, in part due to a positive long-term outlook backed by key strategic partnerships.\n\nWhile revenue degrowth is a concern, STM stock has been in an uptrend. After all, the company has multiple growth catalysts in the next few years. The partnership with AWS is one growth trigger. Similarly, the company’s chip supply to SpaceX for Starlink is expected to double in the next two years.\n\nSTM has also indicated that revenue from silicon carbide power devices is expected to return to 2024 levels by next year. This is after a contraction in revenue in 2025. Further, the firm is targeting data center revenue of $1 billion before the end of the decade.\n\nIn another important development in December 2025, the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed a €500 million financing agreement with the company. This is the initial tranche for a €1 billion credit line that’s intended to boost Europe’s competitiveness in the semiconductor sector. According to the agreement, 60% of the funds will be utilized toward “high-volume manufacturing capabilities” within Europe while 40% will be dedicated to research & development activities. These investments are likely to translate into growth and provide STM with an innovation edge, especially with the emphasis on R&D.\n\nGiven the ratings of 17 analysts, STM stock is a consensus “Moderate Buy.” While eight analysts assign a “Strong Buy” rating to STM, another eight have a “Hold\" rating while one analyst has a bearish “Strong Sell” rating.\n\nBased on these opinions, STM stock has a mean price target of $33.25 currently, implying potential downside of 1% from current levels. However, the most bullish price target of $45 suggests that STM could rise as much as 34% from here.\n\nOne important point to note is that STM stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 times. With analysts estimating earnings growth of 100% and 68% for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively, shares will likely remain in an uptrend.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n\nFeb 12 (Reuters) - Applied Materials ( AMAT ) forecast second-quarter revenue and profit above market estimates on Thursday, betting on a boom in demand for AI processors ‌and a worldwide memory shortage to help drive sales of its chipmaking equipment.\n\nThe ‌rapid build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure — a major driver for Applied — has absorbed much of the world's memory chip ​supply, boosting production capacity, and further helping the company's sales.\n\nThe company's shares rose 12% during premarket trading on Friday. Shares of peers Lam Research ( LRCX ) and KLA ( KLAC ) rose nearly 3% each before the bell, as Applied's upbeat outlook lifted sentiment.\n\nApplied Materials expects second-quarter sales of about $7.65 billion, plus or minus $500 million, ‌compared with estimates of $7.01 billion, ⁠according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe results were \"fueled by the acceleration of industry investments in AI computing,\" CEO Gary Dickerson said in a statement.\n\n\"The ⁠need for higher performance and more energy-efficient chips is driving high growth rates for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\"\n\nThe largest U.S. semiconductor equipment maker forecast second-quarter adjusted profit of about $2.64 ​per share, ​plus or minus 20 cents, compared with estimates ​of $2.28.\n\n\"Memory and logic-foundry capex growth are ‌two sides of the same coin. They are both growing significantly – with memory a greater growth driver near-term,\" said Timm Schulze-Melander, a Rothschild & Co. Redburn analyst.\n\nLogic generally refers to a type of chip that is capable of serving as the brains of a system, such as graphics processors and central processing units.\n\nHigh-bandwidth memory (HBM), made by stacking layers of dynamic random ‌access memory (DRAM) on top of each other, refers ​to a type of advanced memory chip used alongside ​pricey AI processors such as those sold ​by Nvidia .\n\nApplied expects DRAM to be its fastest growing segment in ‌2026, coupled with 3D chiplet stacking — a ​technique used extensively in ​producing AI processors — Dickerson said during a post-earnings call.\n\nThe company reported first-quarter revenue of $7.01 billion, beating estimates of $6.87 billion.\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended January 25 included record DRAM ​sales on a year-on-year basis, ‌finance chief Brice Hill said during the call.\n\nThe company reported first-quarter profit of $2.38 ​per share, excluding items. Analysts had expected $2.20 per share.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in ​Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona and Sriraj Kalluvila)",

      "Content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus .\n\nRelease Date: February 12, 2026\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group ( NASDAQ:BTDR ) achieved a significant revenue increase of 226% year-over-year, reaching $225 million in Q4 2025.\n\nThe company has expanded its self-mining hash rate to over 63 exahashes per second, establishing itself as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miners.\n\nBTDR is making strategic progress in AI infrastructure, with plans to retrofit a 225-megawatt facility in Norway for AI workloads, leveraging hydropower for cost efficiency.\n\nThe company is actively expanding its GPU as a service platform, with plans to add capacity in Malaysia and the United States, targeting sectors like biomedical, robotics, and gaming.\n\nBTDR's vertically integrated strategy, including proprietary chip design and a robust global power portfolio, positions it well for future growth in both Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure.\n\nDespite revenue growth, BTDR's gross profit and adjusted EBITDA declined sequentially due to lower Bitcoin prices and higher electricity costs.\n\nThe company faces litigation that could potentially delay development at its Clarington site, impacting its AI data center expansion plans.\n\nBTDR's gross margin significantly decreased to 4.7% in Q4 2025 from 24.1% in Q3 2025, driven by lower Bitcoin prices and increased depreciation expenses.\n\nOperating expenses increased to $66.3 million in Q4 2025, up from $60.5 million in Q3 2025, due to higher headcount and general corporate activities.\n\nThe company reported an adjusted net loss of $82.6 million in Q4 2025, primarily due to higher energy and depreciation costs, despite higher revenue.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BTDR.\n\nIs BTDR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nQ : What are the main items being discussed in your co-location negotiations? Is it down to price, duration, timing, or design? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: Discussions vary with different counterparties, covering all those aspects. These discussions are sensitive and active, and while we are confident about closing deals soon, predicting the exact timeframe is challenging.\n\nQ : Regarding financing, what should we expect in terms of debt, cost of capital, and credit enhancements? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The cost of capital will depend on the counterparties and deal terms, making it hard to predict until deals are finalized. Credit enhancements are crucial for determining development costs, and we are exploring various approaches, though nothing dramatically different from existing market practices.\n\nQ : Can you provide more details on the infrastructure piece, specifically the Tel Norway site and its customer profile? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The Tel Norway site retrofit is expected to complete by year-end, with production GPUs installed early next year. The site benefits from a low PUE of around 1.1 due to its hydropower and cold climate. Customer discussions are sensitive, but there is overlap with US customers.\n\nQ : How should we think about the growth of your Bitcoin mining business in 2026, especially with AI infrastructure deals in play? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: We are long-term believers in Bitcoin and will continue investing in mining capacity. While we haven't projected future hash rates, we remain committed to expanding our self-mining operations.\n\nQ : With lower Bitcoin prices, is there a point where you would slow mining activity due to higher costs? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: There is a price point where we might slow down, but we haven't reached it yet. Our fleet's efficiency and low energy costs allow us to continue operations even if prices drop further. Older machines might be turned off first, but we don't anticipate reaching that point soon.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .",

      "Content": "Never miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\n\nAnalog Devices (NasdaqGS:ADI) has responded to a shareholder proposal seeking changes to special meeting rights.\n\nThe company is urging investors to vote against the proposal and is pointing to prior changes that lowered the threshold for calling special meetings.\n\nManagement is highlighting its broader governance approach, including a stated focus on shareholder rights and board accountability.\n\nAnalog Devices, known for its analog and mixed signal semiconductors used in industrial, automotive and communications applications, is putting governance firmly in focus with this response. For you as an investor, special meeting rights touch on how quickly shareholders can react when material issues arise. This can be relevant alongside fundamentals like balance sheet strength or end market exposure.\n\nBy stressing both the existing special meeting terms and its stance on accountability, Analog Devices is signaling how it wants to manage shareholder influence over major decisions. As you weigh NasdaqGS:ADI, this type of governance disclosure can sit alongside product mix, customer concentration and capital allocation policies when you think about overall risk and oversight quality.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Analog Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Analog Devices.\n\nSee which insiders are buying and buying and selling Analog Devices following this latest news.\n\nThis governance update is really about where the balance of power sits between ADI’s board and its shareholders. By urging investors to vote against a further expansion of special meeting rights, the company is arguing that the current 25% threshold already offers meaningful influence while limiting the risk that a small group can force company specific events onto the calendar. For you, this is a signal about how ADI prefers to manage activist pressure and board accountability at a time when interest in the stock has been reinforced by recent earnings beats and positive analyst sentiment. It also shapes how long term holders might think about stability, especially when management is already committing capital to areas such as buybacks and growth investments in data centers, autos and industrial markets.\n\nThe company’s emphasis on “long term shareholder value” and governance discipline aligns with the narrative that ADI is positioning for autos, AI and automation, where consistent execution and board oversight can support multi year product and R&D plans.\n\nCalls from some shareholders to loosen special meeting rights could challenge that narrative if they signal impatience with capital allocation choices or with how quickly ADI is pursuing opportunities in areas such as AI infrastructure.\n\nThe investor presentation on special meeting rights adds a governance dimension that is not explicitly covered in the narrative, which mainly focuses on end markets, earnings potential and capital deployment rather than how shareholder rights might influence those plans.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Analog Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ A shareholder base that is pushing for easier special meetings may be a sign of rising activism risk, which can lead to distractions for management or pressure for short term moves that do not match your own time horizon.\n\n⚠️ If some investors view ADI’s stance as too protective of the board, it could create governance related criticism, especially when peers such as Texas Instruments, NXP or Microchip adopt different approaches to shareholder rights.\n\n🎁 The existing 25% threshold is lower than the prior 80% requirement and may help ADI maintain operational focus while still giving a sizeable group of shareholders the ability to act when they see material issues.\n\n🎁 Clear communication that the board is focused on accountability and long term value can support confidence for investors who are already watching ADI’s earnings momentum and analyst interest in its data center and auto exposure.\n\nYou will want to see how the vote on the proposal turns out and whether support for the shareholder resolution is high enough to suggest persistent governance pressure. Watch for any follow up from large holders or governance advisory firms, as their reaction can shape future proposals or board engagement. It is also worth tracking how ADI’s board decisions on capital returns, acquisitions and R&D align with this message about long term value, especially compared with peers in the analog and mixed signal space that face similar investor activism.\n\nTo stay informed on how the latest news affects the investment narrative for Analog Devices, visit the community page for Analog Devices to keep up with the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Title": "What Makes Monolithic Power (MPWR) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-monolithic-power-mpwr-strong-170004817.html",
      "Content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In \"long context,\" investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Monolithic Power (MPWR) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monolithic Power currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MPWR that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor MPWR, shares are up 9.4% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is up 7.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.67% compares favorably with the industry's 11.65% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Monolithic Power have increased 35.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 71.09% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.65% and 15.6%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of MPWR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now MPWR is averaging 710,006 shares for the last 20 days..\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MPWR.\n\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPWR's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.91 to $21.63 in the past 60 days.

      "Content": "Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThursday, Feb. 12, 2026 at 8:00 a.m. ET\n\nChief Executive Officer — Jihan Wu\n\nChief Business Officer — Haris Basit\n\nChief Financial Officer — Matt Linghui Kong\n\nHaris will provide a high-level overview of Bitdeer Technologies Group's fourth quarter 2025 results and discuss the company's strategy, provide a detailed business update, and review the financial results for the quarter. Jihan, Matt, and Haris will be available for questions after the formal remarks. To accompany today's call, we have provided a supplemental investor presentation available on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s investor relations website under Webcasts and Presentations. Before management begins their formal remarks, I would like to remind everyone that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.\n\nFor a more complete discussion on forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties related to Bitdeer Technologies Group's business, please refer to the company's filings with the SEC. In addition to discussing results calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, we will also reference certain non-IFRS financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit and loss. For more detailed information on our non-IFRS financial measures, please refer to our earnings release published earlier today, which can be found on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s IR website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Haris. Thank you, John, and good day, everyone.\n\nHaris Basit: It is great to be with you today. The 2025 marked a defining period of execution and strategic progress for Bitdeer Technologies Group. Achieved critical milestones across our three strategic pillars, and position the company for sustained growth as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company. I will start with a brief overview of our financial performance for the quarter. Fourth quarter total revenue reached $225,000,000, up 226% year over year and 33% sequentially. Gross profit totaled $10,600,000, adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000 for the quarter.\n\nWhile both metrics declined sequentially, the results primarily reflect a combination of lower average Bitcoin pricing, modestly higher electricity costs, substantially higher depreciation expense due to the rapid expansion of our self-mining capacity, and further investment in new talent to support our growing AI HPC initiatives. I will discuss these factors in greater detail later in the call. Let me begin with a brief review of our power and infrastructure portfolio. We continue to make meaningful progress during the quarter, advancing a global portfolio of sites that we believe are well suited to support both large-scale Bitcoin mining and next-generation AI and HPC workloads.\n\nAcross regions, our focus remains on developing power-rich, capital-efficient infrastructure that provides flexibility, speed to market, and long-term strategic optionality. From an energy infrastructure perspective, execution during the quarter remained on track. At the January, we had over 1.66 gigawatts of capacity online, and a total global power pipeline of three gigawatts. We believe this represents one of the most attractive and AI-suitable power portfolios in the industry and provides us with a vast opportunity as the demand for such capacity continues to grow. Over the past several months, have seen a significant shift in market dynamics around AI data center development.\n\nDemand for large-scale colocation capacity has increased substantially and we have responded by refining our approach to better align with this opportunity. Therefore, we are currently prioritizing colocation services provided to Norway and the United States that are suitable for large-scale AI HPC deployments. Let me walk through a few sites and where we stand with our development plans. First, Teadle, Norway, represents our most near-term colocation opportunity. This 225-megawatt facility was originally constructed to Tier III data center specifications, which puts us in a favorable position for conversion to AI workloads.\n\nWe estimate the retrofit will require much less incremental capital expenditure to add uninterruptible power supply systems, backup batteries, and generation, as well as some additional cooling capacity compared to industry benchmarks for greenfield Tier III data center development, which typically run in the $8,000,000 to $12,000,000 per megawatt range. The site benefits from hydropower with attractive economics; independent 100-megawatt transformers provide redundancy. We are currently in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expect to be in a position to announce a signed lease agreement for Teadle as soon as possible in 2026, although the exact timing is very difficult to predict.\n\nThis site should be capable of supporting initial test GPU deployment late 2026 and first production GPUs expected in early 2027. Second, our 570-megawatt site in Clarington represents one of the larger AI data center development opportunities in the United States. Have made progress on two fronts here. First, the local utility has accelerated our interconnection timeline. Second, we are currently in discussion with multiple prospective tenants. These are well recognizable companies in the space, and the discussions are progressing. While litigation has recently been filed that could potentially delay development at this location, believe that we have meritorious claims and a strong defense and will pursue an expedient solution.\n\nGiven the scale of this site, even a partial or first phase lease would represent a significant milestone for Bitdeer Technologies Group and would provide substantial contracted revenue while derisking our development capital. Third, at Rockdale, we are pursuing a strategy that allows us to maintain our current Bitcoin mining operations while developing new HPC capacity. We are evaluating the acquisition of adjacent land to our existing facility we could potentially construct a purpose-built HPC data center. This approach would minimize disruption during data center development to our 563-megawatt mining operation, which continues to generate revenue. The greenfield HPC build would be designed from the ground up for AI workloads.\n\nThe Rockdale site benefits from its location in the ERCOT market, provides operational flexibility. We are currently talking with prospective colocation tenants for this site. The dual-track approach, maintaining Bitcoin mining while developing HPC capacity, reflects our commitment to both businesses and our ability to optimize our power portfolio across use cases. While we are prioritizing colocation for our larger sites, continue to see opportunity in GPU-as-a-service for targeted markets. We are expanding our cloud platform in Malaysia by 10 to 15 megawatts, building on the success we have had in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming sectors who need fully managed orchestrated infrastructure.\n\nIn the United States, we are planning to add 10 megawatts of GPU capacity in Washington state and are evaluating a partial conversion of our Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud. I want to be clear that the scale of our long-term US GPU-as-a-service expansion is predicated on signing customer contracts. Do not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. Expect all major GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customers who are seeking meaningful capacity with comprehensive managed services. This disciplined approach ensures we are deploying capital we have revenue certainty. A key element of our strategy is how we are approaching data center development.\n\nWe have built an internal development team with experience in very large data center construction and we are augmenting that team through strategic hires, working with experienced EPC contractors and general contractors on a fee basis rather than through joint venture arrangements. This gives us greater control over timelines and specifications, and importantly, it allows us to retain more of the economic value these assets generate. As we look ahead, the growth will continue to be anchored by our three strategic pillars, between mining, ASIC development, and HPC AI. Together, these represent a vertically integrated, highly defensible platform that leverages our deep technology expertise, proprietary chip design capabilities, and extensive global power portfolio.\n\nThe supply-demand imbalance for AI compute continues to widen, and we expect this shortage to persist well into 2027. Time to power is a critical variable, and we believe Bitdeer Technologies Group is exceptionally well positioned to serve customers seeking both near-term and midterm capacity. On the Bitcoin mining side, the rapid expansion of our self-mining platform continues. We exited the year with more than 55 exahash per second of self-mining hash rate, and in the month of January alone, we brought another eight exahash per second online, exiting the month of January at over 63 exahash per second. This firmly establishes Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miners by total hash rate under management.\n\nSupported by the disciplined rollout of our SealMiner fleet, accelerated deployment of SealMiner rigs has driven material improvements in fleet-wide efficiency. The SealMiner A2 and A3 being actively deployed in our self-mining business operate at approximately 15 to 16.5 joules per terahash and 12.5 to 14 joules per terahash respectively, and represent industry-leading power efficiency. As these next-generation rigs replace legacy third-party equipment, our blended fleet efficiency continues to improve, with our overall fleet-wide efficiency currently standing at 17.5 joules per terahash as of 01/31/2026. As SealMiner penetration increases throughout 2026, we expect our overall fleet-wide efficiency to continue to improve, enhancing our mining margins. Looking ahead, our self-mining operations are not plateauing.\n\nOur investments in chip design are delivering tangible results. During the quarter, we commenced mass production of the SealMiner A3 series. Initial shipments began in November, and we have deployed a total of 8.7 exahash of our SealMiner A3 to date. As we continue to retire older-generation third-party rigs, we expect the A3 series to continue to meaningfully contribute to our fleet efficiency improvements and growth throughout 2026. On the R&D front, our CLO4-1 chip was completed back in September. The CLO4-1 represents a meaningful step forward in efficiency and positions Bitdeer Technologies Group to maintain technological leadership as the industry continues its relentless drive towards lower power consumption per unit of hash rate.\n\nMass production of mining rigs based on the CLO4-1 chip will begin in Q1 2026. CLO4-2 chip design remains under development at our US-based design center. Additionally, we have successfully taped out a new Litecoin chip, SEAL-DL1, designed for Doge and Litecoin mining. The initial test results of SEAL-DL1 have exceeded comparable rigs in both energy efficiency and hash rate. On the recent market conditions, the CLDL1 generates higher fiat-based returns per megawatt than our SealMiner A2. Preparation for USA SealMiner manufacturing remains in progress. This initiative is a core component of our vertically integrated strategy and aligns with both operational resilience objectives and evolving trade and supply chain dynamics.\n\nNow let me walk through our detailed financial results for the quarter. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that all figures I refer to today are in US dollars. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $224,800,000, up 225.8% year over year and up 32.5% sequentially. The year-over-year growth and sequential growth in revenue was primarily driven by significantly higher self-mining hash rate as a result of continued CLMiner deployment, as well as contributions from SealMiner sales, offset in part by slightly lower Bitcoin prices for the quarter. Self-mining revenue was $168,600,000, compared to $41,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $130,900,000 in Q3 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 306% and a sequential growth of 28.7%.\n\nContinued growth from Q3 2025 levels reflects a significant increase in average operating hash rate and associated Bitcoin production during the quarter, offset in part by 13% lower average Bitcoin prices quarter on quarter. SealMiner sales revenue was $23,400,000, up 105.4% over the $11,400,000 reported in Q3 2025. Total gross profit for the quarter was $10,600,000, reflecting a gross margin of 4.7%, versus 7.4% in Q4 2024 and $40,800,000 or 24.1% in Q3 2025. Significant decline in gross margin reflects the combined impact of several drivers during the quarter. First, obviously, we experienced 13% lower Bitcoin prices during the quarter along with the gradual increase of the global hash rate.\n\nSecond, on the cost side, experienced an approximately 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit during the quarter when compared to Q3 2025, mainly due to the seasonal winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites. Third, the growth in our self-mining hash rate comes with a concurrent noncash depreciation expense associated with this fleet of new miners. Additionally, during the quarter, we changed our methodology for calculating depreciation expense to reflect a more conservative approach. Now depreciate rigs using a three-year straight-line method versus our prior assumption of a five-year depreciable life for hardware. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $66,300,000 compared to $42,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $60,500,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following factors compared to Q3. We added more headcount to support both mining site operations and our AI infrastructure expansion, incurred additional holiday season compensation, along with an increase in year-end general corporate activities. These expenditures reflect the operational requirements of our growing infrastructure footprint and the resources necessary to execute on our strategic initiatives. Other operating expenses for the quarter was $43,800,000 compared to $3,700,000 in Q4 2024 and other operating income of $26,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to the fair value change of Bitcoins pledged for the Bitcoin-collateralized loan since Q3 2025.\n\nOther net gain for the quarter was $208,900,000 compared to other net loss of $4 and $79,800,000 in Q4 2024 and $238,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to noncash fair value change of derivative liabilities related to the convertible senior notes issued in November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025. Adjusted net loss was $82,600,000 versus $37,400,000 in Q4 2024 and $36,300,000 in Q3 2025. The increase in loss was primarily due to higher energy and depreciation costs, higher operating and interest expense, partially offset by the year-over-year higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000, versus negative $4,300,000 in Q4 2024 and positive $39,600,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential decline was primarily driven by higher energy costs and higher operating expenses attributed to salaries and wages for recent additions to our headcount, as well as a number of elevated costs associated with year-end holiday allowance and year-end general corporate activities. To provide a better sense of our G&A expense on a run-rate basis, our Q4 2025 results reflect approximately $3,000,000 of salary, wage, and benefits expense which will largely be recurring, as well as another $6,000,000 to $7,000,000 in consulting, legal, and travel expenses which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was $599,500,000, primarily driven by SealMiner supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs from the mining business, general corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97,900,000, which includes $50,700,000 of capital expenditures relating to data center infrastructure construction, GPU equipment procurement, and tariffs and freight for mining rigs delivered to the data centers, and $150,600,000 of proceeds from the disposal of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the quarter $454,500,000, which resulted primarily from $388,500,000 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $168,000,000 in borrowings from a related party, and $141,500,000 of proceeds from shares sold under our ATM and ELOC program, free offset by $171,100,000 of repayments of borrowings. For the full calendar year 2025, capital expenditures for the continued build out of our global power and data center infrastructure totaled $176,000,000. Looking to full year 2026, we anticipate total infrastructure spend in the range of $180,000,000 to $200,000,000 for crypto mining data center construction.\n\nPlease note that this guidance covers power and crypto mining data center infrastructure only and does not include CapEx for SealMiners and GPU. AI cloud and colocation capital expenditures are also not included. Turning to our balance sheet and financial position. We exited the year with $149,400,000 in cash and cash equivalents, $83,100,000 in cryptocurrencies, held at cost less impairment, $135,600,000 in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1,000,000,000 in borrowings excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities were $501,100,000, relate to the November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025 convertible senior notes.\n\nThis represents $171,400,000 reduction compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a noncash fair value adjustment driven by the change in our stock price and settlement for partial principal of November 2024 convertible senior notes. As I mentioned earlier, this does not impact our liquidity or operations. Regarding our outstanding ATM and ELOC facility, we received approximately $143,600,000 in gross proceeds during the quarter. Approximately 6,700,000 additional shares issued. We have exercised disciplined capital allocation throughout the year using the ATM and ELOC opportunistically to support our growth initiative while minimizing dilution.\n\nAs a final note to our financial update, we wish to note that starting in Q1 2026, we will begin to use GAAP instead of IFRS as our accounting standard. In summary, we are proud of our team's execution this quarter and throughout 2025. I want to express my deep pride what our team has accomplished this year. Established Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the world's largest publicly listed Bitcoin mining operators by total hash rate under management. Our leadership position in self-mining and our proprietary SealMiner technology provide multiple paths to value creation that few, if any, competitors can match.\n\nOur pipeline of developed and contracted power capacity gives us a meaningful competitive edge in serving a variety of customers. The colocation opportunity ahead of us is immense, we are pursuing it proactively. We enter 2026 with strong operational momentum, a differentiated asset base, and a team that has proven its ability to execute at scale. Excited about what lies ahead and remain committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, Operator. Please open the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open for questions. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press *11 and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press *11 again. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Giles of B. Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nNick Giles: Yes. Thank you so much, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Haris, really appreciate the comprehensive update, especially on the colocation side. And my first question was just, and I am sure you are speaking to a range of customers, and you know, at this point of negotiations or discussions, what is really the main items that are being discussed? Is it down to price, duration, timing? There is still a lot of work ongoing around design. Just any additional color on where you stand in the process.\n\nHaris Basit: It is different with different potential counterparties, and we are all of those things that you mentioned are being discussed, maybe not with the same counterparty, but you know, I hesitate to say too much about these discussions. They are sensitive, and you know, very active at this time. So you know, we feel pretty confident that we are going to get colocation deals done in the near future. Predicting that time frame is going to be hard. And, you know, the discussions are pretty intense with several counterparties.\n\nNick Giles: No. Understood. That is helpful, and just my second question was, we think about financing, you made some important comments there on having a larger share of the economics. But should we be expecting in terms of debt cost of capital and what kind of credit enhancements are you looking at, if any?\n\nHaris Basit: Cost of capital for these projects, for the colocation projects, will be very much determined by the counterparties and exact terms of the deal. So I think that is hard to predict right now until we, you know, announce which of these deals are done with which counterparties. Was that responsive to your question? I am not sure if that is what you were.\n\nNick Giles: Asking.\n\nHaris Basit: I mean, that is an important part of any deal. And, you know, it is because it does determine the cost of development to a large extent. And so we are, you know, we are looking at many different approaches here. It is a very important part of getting the deal done right. So it is something that we are focusing on as well. I cannot really say which ones are better or worse. It depends a lot on the counterparty, and it depends on, you know, there is a number of ways to do this. Most of them have been already done in the Marketplace.\n\nAnd know, I do not think you will see anything too dramatically different from those when we announce.\n\nNick Giles: Got it. Understood. Well, again, I appreciate the update, and continue. Best of luck.\n\nJihan Wu: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Colonnese of H.C. Wainwright & Co. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Colonnese: Today. First one for me on the infrastructure piece. It sounds like you are pretty far along in negotiations for a potential colo deal at the Teadle site. Curious what type of customers you are in discussions with specifically at that campus. And, Haris, if I heard correctly, it sounds like the full retrofit for the 225 megs could be completed by the end of this year. There a PUE you guys are assuming that number? I know it is built with Tier III standards in mind, but any additional color would be helpful there.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is correct. We do expect completion of that Teadle Norway site in at the end of this year and then installation of production GPUs at the beginning of next year. And the PUE at that site is actually very low, which is one of the biggest advantages of that site. It is, you know, it is 100% hydropower. It is a nice cold climate. And there is chilled water available from a nearby lake. So the PUE there, for estimation purposes, is around 1.1. It is dramatically better than most locations.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. And then, the typical customer profile for that site specific, I know you are in discussions with the range of customers across the portfolio. I would be just curious with that international facility, the type of customers you are looking at.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, there is some difference, but, you know, there is still a lot of overlap with the customers there versus customers in the United States. So but, you know, I really do not want to say too much about who we are talking to and the exact nature of those deals. They are fairly sensitive negotiations at this point. Understood. Understood. And then as it relates to the Bitcoin mining business, you guys are one of the few public miners that continue to rapidly expand your self-mining capacity. How should we think about growth in this business in 2026? Particularly as you look to pursue these AI infrastructure deals across parts of the portfolio?\n\nHaris Basit: So one thing to say is that we are long-term believers in Bitcoin. And, of course, Bitcoin is in a little bit of a down cycle right now. But long term, we believe in Bitcoin. And we will continue to invest in our Bitcoin mining capacity. We have not given any projections for what the total hash rate for our company might be by the end of this year or in any future quarter yet. We are still evaluating that and we may project that at a later time. But at this time, we do not have any projections to share publicly for future growth of our hash rate.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. Thanks for the color, Haris, and best of luck with these opportunities.\n\nOperator: Thank you, Mike. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on all this capacity you have activated. But maybe along those lines that was asked before, with the lower Bitcoin prices, is there a price where you slow your mining activity because costs are higher versus what the hash price would be?\n\nHaris Basit: I am sure there is such a price, so we just have not reached it yet. So you know, our efficiency of our fleet keeps improving. And, so it also, you know, as price goes down, it be the entire fleet. Some parts of the fleet, you know, because of the efficiency and because of the energy price at that location, can continue to operate for quite some, you know, in quite some even further decrease beyond here. And then you will, some of the older machines that have been around for several years, those could be turned off first. Right? In fact, just in our normal upgrade cycle, we will be replacing those.\n\nSo there is, you know, we have not reached that point now, and I do not anticipate that we will. But, you know, of course, there is such a price. It is just much lower than what we are at now.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. That is good information. I guess as you keep lowering your costs, then you can handle lower Bitcoin prices. But just as another topic, is the GPU-as-a-service, is there a good market for the, say, N minus one GPU clusters rather than spending money on the very leading edge of GPUs? Is there still a need for GPU-as-a-service for the older GPUs?\n\nHaris Basit: Yes. There is. We are, though, however, typically pursuing the latest and greatest GPUs. But I mean, we still get demand for, you know, even our oldest H100s that we have in Singapore.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi of ROTH. Your line is now open.\n\nDarren Aftahi: Yes, good morning. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Haris, could you dive a little bit more into sort of the scale and scope of the hires you have made for digital infrastructure towards the end of the year that you spoke to, and then kind of the cadence of continued investment in maybe Q1 and into 2026? I guess, at what point do you feel like you have an adequate team to kind of attack this opportunity?\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, we are very pleased with some of our recent hires. We have hired people with direct expertise in AI, in cloud services. And a lot of those folks have been in the United States, but also in Asia. The team is, you know, the number of people dedicated to this has grown dramatically. I do not think I have an exact number. But we continue to hire. I do not think we have reached, you know, a place where we think we have enough folks yet. But we are still looking for people, especially on the side of the engineering part of building data centers with still open racks there. So no.\n\nI expect that we will continue to hire throughout the year. And a lot of those folks will be in the United States. But, you know, we have also done significant AI hiring in Asia.\n\nDarren Aftahi: Got it. And then same question on the Rockdale site is sort of twofold. In terms of land acquisition for that, kind of where are you, and what is the timeline on process? And then I know Oncor is supposed to put another substation in, and I think you guys have spoken to additional capacity there. I think it is in the 100-some plus megawatts. But in light of kind of the seesaw that is going on with ERCOT and decision on batching, just kind of curious about your thoughts about prospects of Rockdale actually growing as a site. Thanks.\n\nHaris Basit: The recent, you know, information around ERCOT and power allocation in that region, we do not believe that applies to the growth at Rockdale. So the 179, up to 179 megawatts that we anticipate we could add there, should not be affected by that. And I say it that way because, of course, we do not know what the exact regulations will be. They are just still under discussion. So we do expect that we will get most of that, if not all of that additional capacity. The land acquisition there is moving forward. You know, it is not done until it is done, but we are, we are, yeah.\n\nI am not sure how to characterize where we are in that process, but, you know, we are actively pursuing it. And we expect that we will finish it. But until we do, it is hard to say exactly when that is going to happen. Great. Appreciate the insights. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Greg Lewis of BTIG. Your line is now open.\n\nGreg Lewis: Hey. Thank you, and good morning. Good open. Hey, I guess first, I mean, on published numbers, I guess you guys are the bitcoin miner of the listed companies by XFASH. So congrats on that. I did want to talk a little bit about the GPU business. You noted about potential expanse. You should a mouthful. The potential expansion in Malaysia. Know, just kind of curious, is that infrastructure that we are building, are we leasing? And then just kind of how should we think about, you know, the rollout of that, I guess, I think you mentioned 15 megawatts in Malaysia for the GPUs.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is infrastructure that we are leasing. I welcome Matt or Jihan to add to that. They want. But what was the second part of your question? How should we think about the rollout of bringing those 15 megawatts online and generating revenue from that? I mean, we have proactively purchased some, I think, the GB200 NVL72 and installed it just recently there. So that is in place right now. In terms of additional machines there, do not think we have made any announcements at present. So that is actually.\n\nGreg Lewis: Okay. But it is, but it sounds like it sounds like we could start seeing revenue maybe in the second quarter, and then maybe that scales up sequentially for a couple of quarters?\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I think, John and Matt are closer to that than I am. So I do not know if, is that a, is that a correct statement that you have?\n\nJihan Wu: I think we will be able to deploy GPUs into those infrastructures at the fourth quarter or third quarter of this year. It depends on when that infrastructure will be ready. We will no tests. It will be ready around June. But, and maybe there will be one or two month delays. So I sent 2024 can be more conservative estimation.\n\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Super helpful. Alright. Hey, everybody. Thanks for the time, and have a great day.\n\nJihan Wu: Thank you, Greg.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Todaro: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question and the all the extra hash, bro. I guess, can we just get a bit more color on Clarrington? Like, do you need litigation results before signing an HPC customer there? You view that differently. Maybe any guardrails on timeline there? And then I have a follow-up on the mining piece.\n\nHaris Basit: So because it is litigation, we have to be sort of, you know, more careful in what we say here. You know, our attorneys feel very strongly that we have a very good case here, and the litigation has little merit, and we will, you know, prevail here. And on the business side, we are, you know, exploring alternative that can mitigate the impact of the litigation. I do not really want to say a lot more than that. You know, as we said in our scripted remarks, we do anticipate that there will be, you know, some potential delay. But, you know, we are still confident in the site overall.\n\nBut it is early days, and we, you know, we are looking at some significant alternatives.\n\nJihan Wu: Yeah. I think the alternative, alternative here, we have multiple alternative options. Creating alternative options is to solve those problems. I believe it is very critical solving those problems. And at a company level, Clarrington, Rockdale, and our lower chin size, we would be able to have lots of alternatives. Other than Carrington. This is the company level. And under the Clariton level, we believe we have several solutions. So I do not think that we are really caught at this kind of litigation.\n\nJohn Todaro: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then on the that latest tape out for the Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, do you anticipate mining some of these other assets? Alongside Bitcoin? And maybe I was looking at some of the margin profile. It looks like there is still some margin there. But maybe the opportunity in those as well.\n\nJihan Wu: Well, I think 99% or 98% will still be Bitcoin mining. This autochrome mining operations cannot really be scalable very much due to the market cap. So we count into a very small size operations. But on those, on those capacity, we deploy those manual rates yield out of from those capacity will be significantly improved. So I think it is worth the effort to add some, add some. And then, by the way, this is our first b commanding chip and the manual machines that are designed and manufactured totally depends on our Singapore and the Malaysia office. And the Malaysia operation as well. Malaysia operation, we started to build since last year or earlier.\n\nI think that this product, it also means that our supply chain center in Malaysia has been quite mature. So Malaysia and Vietnam, we will have two supply chain center. For companies. Think it is very strategic and important for the resilience of our business in the future.\n\nHaris Basit: Understood. That is helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Thanks, John.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Knoblauch of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\n\nBrett Knoblauch: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe now that we are several weeks into the year, I am curious if you have any insights into what wafer allocation is going to look like this year compared to last year? And on the back of that, with Bitcoin price coming down, network cash staying resilient, hash price going to kind of near all-time lows, does that, you know, more incentivize you guys to use manufacturing capacity for, call it, internal use rather than sell external? Or how should we kind of look at the split between what you guys manufacture for yourselves Versus sell this year? Thank you.\n\nJihan Wu: We cannot tell the exact number or situation with the different allocation, but we have a really good relationships. And even though the we all know that the demand for AI business is huge, several times. Then take them to rehab, but we will get some co coda from additional capacity. And the hash price drops to historically due now recently. And it became very difficult for sending the money works with profit. But we have our own capacities or electricity cost is one of the lowest on the market. And our CapEx, so perhaps combined together, we are the lowest on the market.\n\nSo our self money definitely became kind of very defensive, very safe strategy for our companies to make sure that even though in this kind of environment, our Bitcoin mining operations will be profitable. So self deployment will be a very important strategy in 2006, especially in the kind of a very bearish marketplace. I think our market share for the Bitcoin mining output will continue to grow. Into something.\n\nHaris Basit: Perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl of Northland. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Grondahl: Hey, thank you. Hey, Haris, I just wanted to ask, on the November call, there was a significant emphasis on, you know, GPU rental, and that is what Bitdeer Technologies Group wanted to do. And now it seems like you are adjusting that a little bit on some of the larger sites, you know, colocation. Can you just talk about pivot away or why you are seemingly deemphasizing GPU rental at some of those large sites?\n\nHaris Basit: Maybe, Jihan, do you want to do that answer first, and then I can chime in if there is still.\n\nJihan Wu: Yes. I as an on the very live site, colocation is kind of very natural and good choice for a company. And for GPU rental, we have a smaller size Washington State and Tennessee State. We can absolutely handle that ourselves. And maybe a larger capacitors for a lot of interest is besides, like, 10 megawatts or 50 megawatts. They want the nitrocytes anyway, and the nitrocytes in before company better to have some coefficient deal.\n\nHaris Basit: Do you have another question, Mike?\n\nMike Grondahl: No. So hey. Just so I understand, you have just sort of the larger sites, you will go colocation. The smaller ones, you go GPU rental. I guess that was kinda my takeaway. Is that fair?\n\nHaris Basit: Yes. That is correct. Got it.\n\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line Steven Glagola of KBW. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Glagola: Hey, thanks for the question. I have two. First for Haris. I would like to clarify whether Bitdeer Technologies Group’s US AI cloud expansion and potential expansion in Washington and Tennessee is dependent on securing multiyear reserve capacity agreements? And if so, one of those commitments would primarily be for bare metal deployments. That is one. And then second, for Jihan and Matt, you know, it would be helpful to hear your perspective on why USA cloud expansion is strategically attractive at this stage. You know, how do you think about sort of long-term competitive advantages in AI cloud as you broaden beyond your current Asia-centric footprint? Thank you.\n\nHaris Basit: So the first part, our expansion of GPU in the United States is dependent on, you know, signing contracts, at least any significant large-scale expansion is. You know, we can speculatively do small expansion in the United States. But as we said in the statement, anything significant would be backed by contracts.\n\nJihan Wu: And we have our own data centers. I think that is very important advantage right now in the US market. Means that under the end of this year, we will be able to deploy the H300 and about rubings with our own data centers. In the United States right now is the center of AI innovation globally. The demand in US market is so much stronger than any other market. And also the US customers also just one. Capacity on US soil. So we have this kind of capacity in US. And we are going to build it, and then we can build it. We will finish it.\n\nI think this will be the most important advantage on the market right now.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

      "Content": "On February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners disclosed a new position in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (NYSE:MSGS) , acquiring 214,891 shares in an estimated $55.59 million trade based on quarterly average pricing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners initiated a new position in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp., purchasing 214,891 shares. The estimated transaction value was $55.59 million, calculated using the average price during the quarter. The fund’s quarter-end stake in MSGS was valued at $55.59 million, with the net position change reflecting both purchase volume and share price fluctuation in the period.\n\nThis was a new position for the fund, representing 1.66% of its 13F reportable assets under management.\n\nTop five holdings after the filing:\n\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\n\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\n\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares of MSGS were priced at $279.76, up 34.3% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 by 19.92 percentage points.\n\nMetric\n\nValue\n\nMarket Capitalization\n\n$6.73 billion\n\nRevenue (TTM)\n\n$1.07 billion\n\nNet Income (TTM)\n\n($16.56 million)\n\nPrice (as of market close February 10, 2026)\n\n$279.76\n\nOperates professional sports franchises, including the New York Knicks (NBA), New York Rangers (NHL), development league teams, and esports organizations\n\nOwns and manages sports assets, generating revenue from media rights, sponsorships, and merchandising\n\nServes sports fans, media partners, and corporate sponsors, with a focus on the New York metropolitan area and global sports audiences\n\nMadison Square Garden Sports Corp. is a leading owner and operator of major professional sports franchises, leveraging iconic brands such as the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. The company capitalizes on its strong market presence and diversified sports assets to drive revenue from multiple streams, including media, sponsorship, and merchandising. Its strategic focus on marquee teams and premier sports entertainment positions it as a key player in the U.S. sports and entertainment industry.\n\nRecently, Reinhart Partners, a Wisconsin-based investment management firm, acquired approximately 215,000 shares of Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (MSGS) valued at around $55.6 million. Here’s what it means for investors.\n\nTo begin, MSGS stock has performed well recently. Over the last five years, shares of MSGS have advanced by 63%, with much of that gain coming in the last year alone. MSGS operates legendary sports franchises, including the New York Rangers and New York Knicks.\n\nAcross sports leagues like the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA), franchise values are soaring. In addition, video streaming services and advertisers are desperate to land exclusive rights to must-watch live events, with sports being the most sought-after category.\n\nTherefore, organizations like MSGS (and their associated leagues) now find themselves in a powerful position to negotiate lucrative media rights deals with both local, national, and even international distributors. All that said, MSGS still remains a relatively small company (market cap of around $6 billion). Moreover, it remains stubbornly unprofitable, with a net income of ($16.6 million) over the last 12 months.\n\nTo close, investors may want to tread with caution. While MSGS stock does have great potential, its lack of consistent profitability could hold it back. Those interested in sports stocks would be wise to consider this list of best sports stocks to buy in 2026 .\n\nBefore you buy stock in Madison Square Garden Sports, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Madison Square Garden Sports wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "On February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners disclosed a significant buy of Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) , adding 537,726 shares in a transaction estimated at $95.28 million based on quarterly average pricing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners increased its holding in Paycom by 537,726 shares. The estimated transaction value was $95.28 million, based on the average closing price during the quarter. At quarter-end, the value of the stake rose by $82.74 million compared to the prior period, a figure that includes both the impact of share purchases and market price changes.\n\nThe move was a buy, resulting in Paycom accounting for 2.9% of the fund’s reportable assets as of December 31, 2025.\n\nTop holdings after the filing:\n\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\n\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\n\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares were priced at $124.94, down 38.5% over the past year and trailing the S&P 500 by 53.0 percentage points.\n\nMetric\n\nValue\n\nRevenue (TTM)\n\n$2.00 billion\n\nNet income (TTM)\n\n$453.20 million\n\nDividend yield\n\n1.3%\n\nProvides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions, including payroll, talent acquisition, time and labor management, and analytics applications.\n\nOperates a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, generating recurring revenue from subscription fees for its suite of integrated HCM tools.\n\nServes small to mid-sized businesses in the United States seeking comprehensive workforce management and compliance solutions.\n\nPaycom provides cloud-based HCM software delivered through a SaaS model, offering end-to-end workforce management solutions for small to mid-sized businesses in the United States.\n\nReinhart Partners, a Wisconsin-based investment management firm, acquired approximately $95 million worth of Paycom shares during the fourth quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2025). Here’s what investors should take away from this transaction.\n\nFirst off, it’s important to contextualize this purchase. Paycom shares have been in steady decline for several years. Indeed, since 2021, Paycom stock has fallen by roughly 70%. While there are many reasons for this slide, the biggest has to be the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMany analysts are concerned that AI will serve as a replacement to many ‘off-the-shelf’ software products — particularly in the field of payroll and human resources. That would be a major problem for Paycom, whose business model revolves around the sale of such products. What’s more, the concern isn’t simply theoretical. Paycom’s revenue growth has slowed from 30% in 2021 to under 10% in 2025.\n\nThat’s not to say that Paycom stock can’t bounce back. However, given the rapid development of AI, SaaS companies like Paycom remain at risk. While Paycom stock could be the right choice for investors betting on a turnaround, average investors may be wise to consider these tech stocks to watch in 2026 .\n\nBefore you buy stock in Paycom Software, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paycom Software wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Bitdeer’s Q4 earnings are out (NASDAQ: BTDR), and the financial results show the bitcoin miner increasing its revenue by 225% to $224.8 million over the quarter.\n\nBitdeer booked a net profit of $70.5 million compared to a net loss of $531.9 million in Q4 2024. Bitdeer’s total revenue for the quarter was triple the $69.0 million it reported in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe #1 podcast for emerging tech stocks, Bitcoin, and weekly news analysis. Subscribe to the Blockspace Podcast here, on Apple, Spotify, or anywhere you listen to podcasts.\n\nThe surge in top-line growth stemmed primarily from the expansion of self-mining operations, which generated $168.6 million during the quarter. Bitdeer expanded its proprietary hashrate to 58.0 EH/s, up from 8.9 EH/s in the prior year period, and expanded its total hashrate under management to 71 EH/s.\n\nBitdeer mined 1,673 bitcoin in the quarter, a sharp rise from the 469 bitcoin produced a year earlier. It improved its bitcoin mining fleet efficiency to 17.9 J/TH as the firm replaced older machines with its proprietary SEALMINER rigs.\n\nBitdeer sales of SEALMINER rigs and accessories contributed $23.4 million to quarterly revenue. Bitdeer recently taped out its new SEAL-DL1 chip for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining as production of its bitcoin mining rigs topped 65 EH/s in January.\n\nBitdeer earned $2.3 million from its HPC and AI Cloud segment for the quarter. The firm recently deployed NVIDIA GB200 systems in a Malaysian data center to service AI workloads. This move aligns with Bitdeer’s stated dual-track strategy to leverage high-performance computing demand.\n\nThe company’s management outlined a strategic shift toward AI/HPC infrastructure, prioritizing colocation models for its largest power assets. Matt Kong, Chief Business Officer, noted the firm plans to prioritize colocation for sites like Tydal, Norway, and Clarington, Ohio, to capture superior economics.\n\nThe timeline for the 570 MW Clarington project remains under review following legal complications. Bitdeer faces a lawsuit from a neighboring tenant alleging the data center plans violate shared infrastructure rights. This dispute has introduced uncertainty regarding the deployment schedule for one of the company’s largest sites under development.\n\nBitdeer’s balance sheet featured $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, with an additional 2,017 bitcoin valued at approximately $218.6 million. Bitdeer’s debt stands at $1.0 billion following recent convertible note issuances.",

      "Content": "Revenue surged 225.8% YoY to $224.8 million in Q4 2025, but gross profit fell to $10.6 million (4.7% margin) as a ~13% lower average Bitcoin price, higher electricity costs and a shift to a three‑year depreciation schedule materially pressured profitability.\n\nBitdeer is rapidly scaling self‑mining and hardware: self‑mining revenue hit $168.6 million, the company exited 2025 with >55 EH/s and topped >63 EH/s in January, began mass production of SEALMINER A3 and plans SEAL04‑1 volume production in Q1 2026 (SEAL‑DL1 Litecoin chip taped out).\n\nThe firm is pivoting toward AI/HPC colocation and GPU-as-a-Service with 1.66 GW online and a 3 GW pipeline (key sites Tydal, Clarington, Rockdale), while reporting heavy cash use (net operating cash outflow $599.5 million), ~$1.0 billion of borrowings and a switch to GAAP reporting in Q1 2026.\n\nInterested in Bitdeer Technologies Group? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\n4 Blockchain Stocks That Aren’t Coinbase\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported fourth-quarter 2025 revenue of $224.8 million, up 225.8% year over year and 32.5% sequentially, as the company highlighted continued scale-up in self-mining and growing focus on AI and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure opportunities. Management described the quarter as a period of “execution and strategic progress” as Bitdeer positions itself as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Bitdeer posted gross profit of $10.6 million, representing a gross margin of 4.7%, down from 24.1% in the third quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.2 million, compared with $39.6 million in the prior quarter and negative $4.3 million in Q4 2024.\n\n→ Once Upon A Farm: Buy the $1B Growth Story?\n\nBeyond the Halving: The Future of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nChief Strategy Officer Haris Basit said the sequential decline in profitability primarily reflected a 13% lower average Bitcoin price versus Q3 2025, a roughly 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit driven mainly by winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites, and “substantially higher depreciation expense” tied to rapid expansion of self-mining capacity. The company also increased headcount to support mining operations and AI/HPC initiatives and incurred higher year-end compensation and corporate activity costs.\n\nBitdeer also changed its depreciation methodology to a more conservative approach, moving to a three-year straight-line method for mining rigs compared with a prior five-year useful life assumption, which contributed to higher depreciation expense.\n\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nSelf-mining revenue was $168.6 million, up from $41.5 million in Q4 2024 and $130.9 million in Q3 2025. Management attributed the quarter-over-quarter increase to a higher average operating hash rate and Bitcoin production, partially offset by lower Bitcoin prices and a gradual rise in global network hash rate.\n\nBitdeer also reported $23.4 million in SEALMINER sales revenue, up 105.4% from $11.4 million in Q3 2025.\n\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\n\nOn fleet expansion, Basit said Bitdeer exited 2025 with more than 55 exahash per second (EH/s) of self-mining hash rate and added another 8 EH/s in January, exiting the month at more than 63 EH/s. As of January 31, 2026, overall fleet efficiency stood at 17.5 joules per terahash, with SEALMINER A2 and A3 rigs operating at approximately 15–16.5 J/TH and 12.5–14 J/TH, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bitdeer commenced mass production of the SEALMINER A3 series, with initial shipments beginning in November and 8.7 EH/s deployed to date. Basit said mass production of rigs based on the SEAL04-1 chip is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026, while SEAL04-2 remains under development at the company’s U.S.-based design center. Bitdeer also announced it taped out a Litecoin chip (SEAL-DL1) designed for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, with initial test results said to exceed comparable rigs in energy efficiency and hash rate. CEO Jihan Wu noted the company expects “99% or 98%” of operations to remain Bitcoin-focused, while adding that small-scale altcoin mining could improve yields on certain capacity.\n\nIn Q&A, management said there is a Bitcoin price level that could prompt the company to slow mining activity, but it “hasn’t reached it yet,” adding that higher-efficiency portions of the fleet could operate through further price declines while older machines would be turned off first.\n\nBitdeer emphasized progress on its global power and infrastructure footprint. Basit said the company had more than 1.66 gigawatts (GW) of capacity online at the end of January and a total global power pipeline of 3 GW. Management said it is prioritizing colocation services at AI-suitable sites in Norway and the U.S., reflecting increased demand for large-scale colocation capacity.\n\nKey site updates included:\n\nTydal, Norway: A 225-megawatt facility built to Tier 3 data center specifications. Basit said retrofit capex should be lower than typical greenfield Tier 3 development benchmarks of $8 million to $12 million per MW. The site uses hydropower and includes independent 100 MW transformers for redundancy. Management said it is in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expects to be able to announce a signed lease “as soon as possible in 2026,” though timing is difficult to predict. In Q&A, Basit said estimated PUE is around 1.1, citing hydropower, cold climate, and chilled water availability from a nearby lake. He added the company expects completion of the Tydal site by the end of the year, with production GPU installation at the beginning of next year.\n\nClarington (U.S.): A 570-megawatt site where the local utility has accelerated the interconnection timeline, and the company is in discussions with “well recognizable companies” as prospective tenants. Management disclosed litigation has been filed that could delay development, but said it believes it has a strong defense and is exploring alternatives to mitigate impact.\n\nRockdale (Texas): Bitdeer said it is evaluating acquisition of adjacent land to develop greenfield HPC capacity while maintaining its existing 563 MW Bitcoin mining operation. Management said it believes expected additional capacity of up to 179 MW should not be affected by recent ERCOT discussions, though regulations remain under discussion.\n\nWu characterized the company’s approach as using colocation for very large sites while pursuing GPU-as-a-Service for smaller sites such as Washington State and Tennessee/Knoxville, where Bitdeer believes it can manage deployments directly.\n\nBitdeer said it continues to see opportunities for GPU-as-a-Service in targeted markets and is expanding its cloud platform in Malaysia by 10–15 MW, building on activity in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming. In the U.S., the company plans to add 10 MW of GPU capacity in Washington State and is evaluating a partial conversion of its Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud.\n\nManagement stressed that significant U.S. GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customer contracts and that it does not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. In response to an analyst question, Basit reiterated that major U.S. AI cloud expansion is dependent on signing contracts.\n\nOn Malaysia, management said the infrastructure is being leased. Wu added the timeline to deploy GPUs depends on infrastructure readiness, noting it was expected around June but that delays are common; he suggested Q3 or Q4 as a more conservative estimate.\n\nBitdeer reported net cash used for operating activities of $599.5 million, which management said was primarily driven by SEALMINER supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs, corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97.9 million, including $50.7 million of capital expenditures and $150.6 million in proceeds from cryptocurrency disposals. Net cash generated from financing activities was $454.5 million, driven mainly by $388.5 million of proceeds from convertible senior notes, $168 million in related-party borrowings, and $141.5 million of proceeds from shares sold under its ATM and ELOC program, partially offset by $171.1 million in repayments.\n\nOn the balance sheet, Bitdeer ended the year with $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $83.1 million in cryptocurrencies held at cost less impairment, $135.6 million in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1.0 billion in borrowings, excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities tied to convertible senior notes were $501.1 million, which management said reflected non-cash fair value adjustments and did not impact liquidity or operations.\n\nFor capital spending, Bitdeer said full-year 2025 infrastructure capex totaled $176 million. For 2026, it anticipates $180 million to $200 million of infrastructure spend for crypto mining data center construction, excluding capex for SEALMINERS, GPUs, AI cloud, and colocation.\n\nBasit also noted the company will begin using GAAP instead of IFRS starting in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:BTDR) is a global digital asset mining and computing services provider focused on delivering secure and efficient hashrate solutions to institutional and retail customers. The company leverages its proprietary mining platform to offer hosted mining, hashrate sales and management services, enabling clients to access large-scale mining operations without direct investment in hardware or infrastructure.\n\nBitdeer’s core offerings include mining hosting services, whereby the firm installs, operates and maintains specialized mining equipment on behalf of customers, and hashrate-as-a-service products that provide fixed-capacity mining power with transparent pricing structures.\n\nThe article \" Bitdeer Technologies Group Q4 Earnings Call Highlights \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nTD Cowen upgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $159, citing valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 30% year-to-date. Shopify's \"strong\" quarter, continued growth momentum and the post-earnings pullback \"represents an attractive entry point for investors to own the de facto modern-day eCommerce infrastructure,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho also upgraded Shopify to Outperform from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $150.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded BorgWarner (BWA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $82, up from $46. The firm says the company's entrance into the AI data center market is a \"pivotal shift.\"\n\nBarclays upgraded Analog Devices (ADI) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $375, up from $315. The company has the highest industrial exposure within the analog group \"by far\" and a strong correlation between its sales growth and the Purchasing Managers' Index, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nJPMorgan upgraded MercadoLibre (MELI) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $2,800, up from $2,650. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade following the stock's recent underperformance.\n\nWilliam Blair upgraded Fastly (FSLY) to Outperform from Market Perform without a price target. The company reported a \"stellar\" quarter driven by rising contribution from agentic AI traffic, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nMonness Crespi downgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Sell from Buy with a $120 price target as the firm is cutting estimates \"again\" ahead of the company's Q4 report. The firm says its prior assumption of a steady recovery over the course of calendar 2026 was \"foolish\" given the typical length and magnitude of crypto bear markets, telling investors that it now models softness through the first half of 2026 and sets its calendar 2026 and 2027 estimates below the Street view.\n\nJPMorgan downgraded Kraft Heinz (KHC) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $22, down from $24. The company reported a Q4 beat but its 2026 organic sales growth and earnings outlooks were below consensus estimates, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nBofA downgraded Icon (ICLR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $75, down from $195, after the company announced an internal board investigation into accounting practices and controls and noted that preliminary indications are that the company may have overstated revenues in 2023-2024 by up to 2% each fiscal year. Leerink also downgraded Icon but to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $105, down from $220.\n\nWells Fargo downgraded Inspire Medical (INSP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $70, down from $145.

      "Content": "Investing.com -- Barclays upgraded Analog Devices to Overweight in a note Thursday, arguing the company is best positioned to benefit from an improving industrial backdrop and carries “the cleanest operating model and balance sheet” in the group.\n\nAnalyst Tom O’Malley said purchasing manager indexes have finally provided “the PMI inflection needed for some broader Industrial recovery,” though he cautioned that scars remain from the last cycle.\n\nBarclays noted that inventories at distributors have normalised, but “company inventories remain historically high impacting loadings and utilization, and impairing margins.”\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the bank sees emerging growth tied to data-center trends but remains selective across analog names. O’Malley wrote that ADI has “the most leverage to Industrial exposure,” making it the most attractive way to position for an upturn.\n\nBy contrast, Barclays initiated Microchip at Equal Weight, noting the company is exposed to networking and memory demand from AI data-center buildouts but faces challenges including “a difficult spot from a leverage perspective” and “share loss in low end MCUs.”\n\nThe bank assigned the stock an $80 price target.\n\nBarclays also started coverage of ON Semiconductor at Equal Weight with a $75 target, citing upside from rising data-center dollar content in the move to 800-volt architectures.\n\nHowever, O’Malley said the stock cannot “break out” without a broader recovery in auto demand, which “remains mum for foreseeable future.”\n\nBarclays added that each company in the group faces at least one industry-specific challenge, reinforcing its preference for ADI’s mix of industrial leverage and balance-sheet strength.\n\nRelated articles\n\nBarclays upgrades Analog Devices as industrial recovery takes shape\n\nThese 2 stocks are best positioned to benefit from higher uranium prices: analyst\n\n5 reasons why Jefferies thinks Meta’s pullback is a buying opportunity",

The eleventh stock on our list of best Strong Buy stocks is Silicon Motion Technology Corporation.\n\nTheFly reported on February 5 that B. Riley raised its price target on SIMO to $167 from $135 while maintaining a Buy rating. The company’s Q4 results significantly exceeded consensus estimates, and its Q1 guidance indicates continued strong momentum.\n\nOn the same day, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson also raised the price target on Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:SIMO) to $150 from $130 while maintaining an Outperform rating. NAND/memory limits and possible headwinds from a lower PC and cellphone market were the primary concerns going into the report. However, management guided Q1 higher and projected a sequential increase throughout 2026, with a target of revenues reaching $1.2 billion.\n\nAccording to reports posted on February 3, SIMO expects Q1 revenues to be between $292 million and $306 million, which is higher than the average estimate of $230.44 million. This suggests that the year is off to a far better start than anticipated. Additionally, Silicon Motion expects Q1 operating margins of 16% to 18%, indicating higher profitability. The primary drivers of growth, according to management, were expanding the customer and product portfolio, expanding market share, and entering new markets.\n\nSilicon Motion Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:SIMO) is a global leader in developing and supplying NAND flash controllers and related storage solutions for SSDs, mobile embedded storage, and industrial applications, powering data centers, PCs, smartphones, and IoT devices worldwide.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of SIMO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-monolithic-133002935.html",
      "Content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Monolithic Power (MPWR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MPWR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Monolithic Power's main business drivers.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems, based in Kirkland, WA, designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions. The company focuses on the market for high-performance analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs).\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s products are widely used in industrial applications, telecommunications infrastructure, cloud computing, and automotive and consumer applications.\n\nBeing a fabless company, Monolithic works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the designing and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost.\n\nUnlike other fabless semiconductor companies, Monolithic installs its own proprietary process technologies in third-party contractors&rsquo; equipment and facilities.\n\nMonolithic reported total revenues of $751.15 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company&rsquo;s key product families are direct current to direct current (DC to DC) products and Lighting Control products.\n\nDC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and monitors, automobiles and medical equipment.\n\nLighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products.\n\nBy end market, 21.5% of total revenues came from Storage and Computing in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nEnterprise Data, Consumer, Industrial, Automotive and Communications end-markets contributed 31%, 8.8%, 7.2%, 20.1% and 11.14%, respectively, to the fourth quarter of 2025 revenues.\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s primary competitors are Skyworks Solutions, Microchip Technology, Lattice Semiconductor, IPG Photonics, Power Integrations, Cree, Semtech, Micron Technology, Analog Devices, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES.\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Monolithic Power, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in February 2016 would be worth $21,271.42, or a 2,027.14% gain, as of February 12, 2026, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 279.51% and the price of gold increased 292.77% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MPWR.\n\nMonolithic reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It has a strong growth opportunity due to its robust product portfolio that targets In-Car connectivity and infotainment, advanced driver assistance system and rapid adoption of LED lightings in cars and vehicles. Being a fabless company, MPWR works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the design and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost. However, MPWR faces challenges due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards and short product life-cycles are other challenges.\n\nThe stock is up 21.67% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2026. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "Content": "Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.73 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.14. This compares to a loss of $3.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -430.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.28, delivering a surprise of -481.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nBITDEER TEC GRP, which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $224.84 million for the quarter ended December 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $69.02 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nBITDEER TEC GRP shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.4%.\n\nWhile BITDEER TEC GRP has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for BITDEER TEC GRP was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.16 on $203.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.15 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Cricut, Inc. (CRCT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2025. The results are expected to be released on March 3.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nCricut, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $198.69 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "The stock, metals, and crypto markets have been completely dislocated for four months, with each dancing to its own drummer. Going back to the late 1960s, the S&P 500 and gold have been highly correlated at times and highly negatively correlated at other times. Over that period, gold and silver have had a very negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (USD), as most of the great advances in the metals have occurred during long periods of dollar weakness, and vice versa. One might think that a weak USD would coincide with strong stock-market returns, but that's just not always the case. Starting in 2014, Bitcoin (BTC) was negatively correlated with the USD. The first two massive runs by BTC occurred when the USD was weak, while two of the BTC bear markets occurred when the USD was trending higher. That negative correlation seemed to break in 2024, and there have been periods of risk-on behavior when BTC has been highly correlated with the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). Those times include 2017, March 2020 until November 2021, and a number of times since the end of the 2022 bear market. But the BTC and QQQ correlation has also been busted of late. BTC topped in October 2025 and has witnessed a nasty bear market, while the QQQ has gone sideways since October. John Murphy was the first technician to write about Intermarket Technical Analysis in his 1991 book, and he offers an important lesson: some correlations have (for the most part) lasted for decades and others that simply last until they don't. Investors have to be flexible or the markets will throw them to the wolves.",

(NASDAQ:GFS) was one of the best performers on Wednesday.\n\nGlobalfoundries jumped to an over one-year high on Wednesday, as investors gobbled up shares after the company swung to profitability last year, marking a 439 percent improvement year-on-year.\n\nIn an earnings call, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) said that it swung to a net income of $888 million in 2025 from a $262 million net loss in 2024. This came despite a mere 1 percent uptick in net revenues at $6.79 billion from $6.75 billion year-on-year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter alone, net income stood at $200 million, reversing a $729 million net loss in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues, however, were flat at $1.83 billion.\n\nFollowing the results, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) saw its intra-day share price on Wednesday jump to as much as $48.88 before trimming a few cents to finish the session just up by 16.32 percent at $48.74 apiece.\n\nIn other news, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) announced plans to buy back $500 million worth of its common shares in a bid to boost shareholder value.\n\nThe buyback may be implemented from time to time, through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions, among others.\n\nThe initiative will run for a period of 12 months and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at anytime.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GFS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-incorporated-nasdaq-txn-110015581.html",
      "Content": "The projected fair value for Texas Instruments is US$175 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\nTexas Instruments' US$227 share price signals that it might be 29% overvalued\n\nOur fair value estimate is 20% lower than Texas Instruments' analyst price target of US$219\n\nDoes the February share price for Texas Instruments Incorporated ( NASDAQ:TXN ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model .\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n2026\n\n2027\n\n2028\n\n2029\n\n2030\n\n2031\n\n2032\n\n2033\n\n2034\n\n2035\n\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\n\nUS$6.36b\n\nUS$7.42b\n\nUS$7.97b\n\nUS$8.80b\n\nUS$12.1b\n\nUS$13.6b\n\nUS$15.0b\n\nUS$16.1b\n\nUS$17.2b\n\nUS$18.2b\n\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\n\nAnalyst x14\n\nAnalyst x15\n\nAnalyst x7\n\nAnalyst x2\n\nAnalyst x1\n\nEst @ 12.53%\n\nEst @ 9.80%\n\nEst @ 7.88%\n\nEst @ 6.54%\n\nEst @ 5.60%\n\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11%\n\nUS$5.7k\n\nUS$6.0k\n\nUS$5.9k\n\nUS$5.9k\n\nUS$7.3k\n\nUS$7.4k\n\nUS$7.3k\n\nUS$7.1k\n\nUS$6.9k\n\nUS$6.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 3.4%) ÷ (11%– 3.4%) = US$257b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$257b÷ ( 1 + 11%) 10 = US$93b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$159b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$227, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.639. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\n\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nThreat\n\nDividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

      "Content": "The most recent earnings report from QUALCOMM Incorporated ( NASDAQ:QCOM ) was disappointing for shareholders. However, our analysis suggests that the soft headline numbers are getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nAs finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\n\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nQUALCOMM has an accrual ratio of -0.29 for the year to December 2025. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$13b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$5.37b. Over the last year, QUALCOMM's free cash flow remained steady.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nHappily for shareholders, QUALCOMM produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that QUALCOMM's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of QUALCOMM.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of QUALCOMM's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity , or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Track your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\n\nCadence Design Systems (NasdaqGS:CDNS) has introduced the ChipStack AI Super Agent, described as a first-of-its-kind agentic AI solution for front-end silicon design and verification.\n\nThe platform uses multiple virtual engineers powered by Cadence’s existing EDA tools, with the company indicating potential productivity gains of up to tenfold in chip design workflows.\n\nEarly adoption by Nvidia and Qualcomm, along with Cadence’s investment in robotics AI, points to growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to semiconductor and intelligent device development.\n\nFor you as an investor, this update sits at the intersection of electronic design automation and accelerating AI chip development. Cadence Design Systems, through its core EDA software and AI driven workflows, plays a role in how complex processors and systems on chip move from concept to tape out. As chipmakers look for ways to manage design complexity and time to market, tools that automate front-end design and verification are increasingly central to their operations.\n\nThe ChipStack AI Super Agent and the company’s robotics AI focus may influence how Cadence positions itself with customers building next generation AI centric hardware and intelligent devices. As you evaluate NasdaqGS:CDNS, it can be useful to watch how widely ChipStack is deployed, how it fits alongside competing design flows, and how customers integrate these AI agents into their broader engineering processes.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Cadence Design Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Cadence Design Systems.\n\nWe've flagged 0 risks for Cadence Design Systems. See which could impact your investment.\n\nThis launch pushes Cadence further into AI-powered automation for chip design, an area where it already has a deep presence through tools like Verisium, Cerebrus and the JedAI platform. By coordinating multiple virtual engineers across coding, test creation, regression, debugging and auto fixes, ChipStack is aimed directly at the cost and time bottlenecks that large chipmakers care about most. Early use by Nvidia, Qualcomm and others is a signal that key customers see value in tighter AI integration across their existing Cadence workflows rather than standalone tools. For you, the key question is whether ChipStack can move from early access to broad, paid deployment across those accounts and beyond, which could influence how sticky Cadence’s platform is versus rivals such as Synopsys and Siemens EDA.\n\nThe ChipStack launch lines up with the narrative that AI-driven design tools and partnerships with large chipmakers can support future revenue growth, especially as customers look for higher productivity in advanced AI and high-performance-compute designs.\n\nIf ChipStack requires heavier R&D and cloud infrastructure spending to support complex agentic workflows at scale, it could challenge expectations for steadily rising profit margins over time.\n\nThe narrative focuses on AI design tools and IP demand but gives less attention to Cadence’s push into robotics AI and Physical AI via investments such as Trener Robotics, which could add another leg to the long-term story if it gains traction.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Cadence Design Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\nHigher dependence on large AI-chip customers such as Nvidia and Qualcomm could increase Cadence’s exposure if those relationships weaken or design cycles slow.\n\nCompetitive responses from Synopsys, Siemens EDA or newer AI-tool vendors could pressure pricing or limit how much ChipStack adoption Cadence ultimately achieves.\n\nChipStack aims to deliver up to 10x productivity gains in front-end design and verification, which could strengthen Cadence’s value proposition and support premium pricing for its broader EDA stack.\n\nEarly use across several leading chip designers and a reported multi billion dollar backlog suggest Cadence is already embedded in critical AI and data-center projects, giving it a platform to cross sell new AI agents.\n\nFrom here, keep an eye on how often management references ChipStack wins in future updates, especially any comments on seat growth, usage-based revenues or expansion within existing top customers. Watch for signs of competitive products from other EDA vendors and whether customers are standardising on agent-based design flows or treating them as optional add ons. You might also track how Cadence links ChipStack with newer areas such as robotics AI, since success there would show that its AI tools can extend beyond classic semiconductor design into a broader intelligent-device market.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Cadence Design Systems, head to the community page for Cadence Design Systems to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Monolithic Power Systems delivered a solid fourth quarter, with results surpassing Wall Street’s revenue and profit estimates and prompting a positive market response. Management attributed this quarter’s performance to robust demand in enterprise data and communications end markets, as well as continued momentum in automotive. Tony Balow, vice president of finance, emphasized, “Our non-enterprise data end markets grew by over 40% year-over-year, showcasing the strength of our diversified business model.” The company’s execution and expansion in both established and emerging product lines set the stage for sustained growth.\n\nIs now the time to buy MPWR?

      "Content": "Microchip Technology’s fourth-quarter results reflected the impact of architectural modernization in its end markets, particularly automotive and industrial, as well as sustained improvement in inventory correction across distribution channels. Management pointed to robust growth from networking, data center, and FPGA product lines as the primary drivers of the outperformance, with CEO Steve Sanghi noting, “Microcontrollers and analog businesses were both about flat sequentially, which was well above the typical seasonal level for December.” The quarter benefited from increased demand in aerospace and defense, while the distribution inventory correction reached a more normalized level, supporting stable operating margins and cash flow.\n\nIs now the time to buy MCHP? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).\n\nRevenue: $1.19 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.18 billion (15.6% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $0.44 vs analyst estimates of $0.43 (2.7% beat)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $402 million vs analyst estimates of $401.6 million (33.9% margin, in line)\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.26 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.23 billion\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $0.50 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.49\n\nOperating Margin: 12.8%, up from 3% in the same quarter last year\n\nInventory Days Outstanding: 201, up from 198 in the previous quarter\n\nMarket Capitalization: $43.7 billion\n\nWhile we enjoy listening to the management's commentary, our favorite part of earnings calls are the analyst questions. Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention.\n\nMatthew Prisco (Cantor Fitzgerald) asked about the sustainability of above-seasonal growth and the drivers behind backlog strength. CFO Eric Bjornholt explained that distribution inventory is largely corrected, with strong backlog and bookings for the next quarter, but noted visibility beyond the current quarter remains limited due to short lead times.\n\nVivek Arya (Bank of America Securities) questioned the timeline for reaching the company’s long-term gross margin target. CEO Steve Sanghi and CFO Bjornholt said margin improvement will be gradual, with normalization of inventory reserves and underutilization charges, but did not commit to a specific timeframe.\n\nJim Snyder (Goldman Sachs) inquired about customer inventory behavior and the potential for restocking. Sanghi indicated restocking has not started broadly, but increased expedite requests suggest customer inventories are nearing consumption rates, especially as supply tightens.\n\nBlayne Curtis (Jefferies) asked about the sustainability of licensing and other segment revenue, and the impact on gross margin. Management clarified the licensing benefit will not repeat, but other product lines—including memory and FPGA—are expected to remain strong, supporting gross margin.\n\nChris Caso (Wolfe Research) pressed on the prioritization of debt reduction over share buybacks. Sanghi and Bjornholt emphasized a conservative approach, with no plans for repurchases until leverage is significantly reduced, following lessons from the recent downcycle.\n\nIn coming quarters, the StockStory team will be monitoring (1) the pace of adoption and revenue contribution from automotive Ethernet and industrial connectivity design wins, (2) normalization of customer and channel inventories and its effect on order patterns and lead times, and (3) progress toward improving gross margin through a richer product mix and higher factory utilization. Developments in data center and aerospace/defense segments will also be key to tracking growth.\n\nMicrochip Technology currently trades at $80.73, up from $78.04 just before the earnings.

But not all large-cap stocks are created equal - some are struggling with slowing growth, declining margins, or increased competition.\n\nEven among blue-chip stocks, not all investments are created equal - which is why we built StockStory to help you navigate the market. Keeping that in mind, here are two S&P 500 stocks that could deliver good returns and one that could be in trouble.\n\nMarket Cap: $31.32 billion\n\nOriginally founded as Coach, Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) is an American fashion conglomerate with a portfolio of luxury brands offering high-quality accessories and fashion products.\n\nWhy Should You Dump TPR?\n\nWeak constant currency growth over the past two years indicates challenges in maintaining its market share\n\nOperating margin of 13.3% falls short of the industry average, and the smaller profit dollars make it harder to react to unexpected market developments\n\nDiminishing returns on capital from an already low starting point show that neither management’s prior nor current bets are going as planned\n\nTapestry’s stock price of $155.35 implies a valuation ratio of 22.4x forward P/E. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than TPR .\n\nMarket Cap: $193.9 billion\n\nFormed by the 1997 merger of the two leading semiconductor yield management companies, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is the leading supplier of equipment used to measure and inspect semiconductor chips.\n\nWhy Should You Buy KLAC?\n\nAnnual revenue growth of 16% over the past five years was outstanding, reflecting market share gains this cycle\n\nOfferings are difficult to replicate at scale and lead to a best-in-class gross margin of 60.7%\n\nImpressive free cash flow profitability enables the company to fund new investments or reward investors with share buybacks/dividends, and its rising cash conversion increases its margin of safety\n\nAt $1,478 per share, KLA Corporation trades at 34.9x forward P/E.

      "Title": "Texas Instruments (TXN): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q4 Earnings?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-txn-buy-sell-040422738.html",
      "Content": "Over the past six months, Texas Instruments has been a great trade, beating the S&P 500 by 9.4%. Its stock price has climbed to $226.03, representing a healthy 17.1% increase. This run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\n\nIs now the time to buy Texas Instruments, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it’s free .\n\nWe’re happy investors have made money, but we're swiping left on Texas Instruments for now. Here are three reasons why TXN doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nA company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Regrettably, Texas Instruments’s sales grew at a mediocre 4.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the semiconductor sector. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.\n\nSadly for Texas Instruments, its EPS declined by 1.8% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 4.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\n\nAs you can see below, Texas Instruments’s margin dropped by 19.6 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its relatively low cash conversion. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it’s becoming a more capital-intensive business. Texas Instruments’s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 14.7%.\n\nTexas Instruments isn’t a terrible business, but it doesn’t pass our bar. With its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 34.5× forward P/E (or $226.03 per share). While this valuation is fair, the upside isn’t great compared to the potential downside. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere. We’d recommend looking at one of our top software and edge computing picks .\n\nThe market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\n\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Kadant (+351% five-year return).

      "Content": "Microchip Technology recently expanded its edge AI offering with full-stack solutions built around its long-established MCUs and MPUs, adding pre-trained models and development tools for applications such as arc fault detection, predictive maintenance, facial recognition with liveness detection, and keyword spotting at the edge.\n\nThis push turns Microchip’s embedded controllers into more complete platforms for secure, power-efficient on-device intelligence, potentially deepening its role in emerging edge AI ecosystems that seek to reduce latency, enhance data privacy, and lessen reliance on cloud computing.\n\nWe’ll now examine how Microchip’s expanded full-stack edge AI platform could reshape its investment narrative around AI-driven embedded control.\n\nThe latest GPUs need a type of rare earth metal called Terbium and there are only 32 companies in the world exploring or producing it . Find the list for free.\n\nTo own Microchip, you need to believe its embedded control franchise can translate rising demand for connected, AI-capable devices into durable, higher quality earnings while it works through elevated inventory and a still-leveraged balance sheet. The new full-stack edge AI platform supports the AI-driven embedded control catalyst story, but does not change that the key near term swing factor is how quickly inventories normalize and factory underutilization charges ease, with high debt remaining a central risk.\n\nAmong recent announcements, the launch of the MCPF1525 high density power module for PCIe switches and AI servers ties directly into the same AI and edge compute theme as the MCU and MPU edge AI stack. Together, they broaden Microchip’s participation in AI related workloads, from ultra low power endpoints to data center infrastructure, which could matter for revenue momentum if the current recovery in industrial, auto and data center demand holds.\n\nYet, while edge AI expansion looks promising, investors should still be aware of the company’s high leverage and the possibility that prolonged inventory normalization could...\n\nRead the full narrative on Microchip Technology (it's free!)\n\nMicrochip Technology's narrative projects $6.6 billion revenue and $1.4 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 15.9% yearly revenue growth and an earnings increase of about $1.6 billion from -$178.4 million today.\n\nUncover how Microchip Technology's forecasts yield a $86.96 fair value , a 8% upside to its current price.\n\nSome of the most optimistic analysts were already modeling Microchip to reach about US$8.4 billion in revenue and US$2.1 billion in earnings by 2028, and they lean heavily on faster growth from AI centric tools and advanced controllers compared with the baseline focus on inventory and leverage; the latest edge AI news could reinforce that view or prompt a rethink, and as a shareholder you should weigh these very different narratives side by side.\n\nExplore 5 other fair value estimates on Microchip Technology - why the stock might be worth less than half the current price!\n\nDisagree with existing narratives?

      "Title": "Intel AI Push Deepens With SambaNova Bet And New GPU Chief",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-ai-push-deepens-sambanova-010850786.html",
      "Content": "Get insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\n\nIntel (NasdaqGS:INTC) is committing at least US$100 million to AI chip startup SambaNova Systems.\n\nThe company has also appointed former Qualcomm executive Eric Demers as its new Chief GPU Architect.\n\nBoth moves reflect a shift in how Intel is approaching AI chips and GPU development.\n\nIntel, known for its x86 processors and data center products, is increasingly tied to demand for AI computing across cloud, enterprise, and edge use cases. The SambaNova investment adds capital to a specialist in AI hardware and software, at a time when dedicated AI chips have become an important focus for chipmakers.\n\nFor you as an investor, these steps highlight where Intel is trying to compete more directly in AI accelerators and GPUs, rather than relying only on its existing CPU franchise. The combination of external investment and a new GPU leader may lead to product and partnership changes that you can monitor over upcoming product cycles.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Intel by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\n\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 2 things going right for Intel that every investor should see.\n\nFor Intel, putting at least US$100 million into SambaNova and hiring Eric Demers looks like a move to close gaps in AI accelerators and high performance GPUs, where Nvidia and AMD currently set the pace. SambaNova gives Intel closer access to AI-specific chip design and software stacks, while Demers brings experience from another large chipmaker in building competitive GPU roadmaps. Together, these steps point to Intel trying to serve hyperscalers that are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI data centers, not just with CPUs and foundry capacity but with a fuller portfolio of accelerators. The flip side is execution risk. Intel is already investing heavily in new manufacturing nodes and materials, and layering a deeper AI chip push on top of that raises questions about focus, timelines and returns on capital. If Intel can coordinate its CPU, GPU, custom AI silicon and foundry efforts around what large cloud and enterprise buyers actually want, this news could represent a meaningful evolution of its data center business model. If that coordination does not materialize, it could simply add complexity without a clear payoff.\n\nThe SambaNova investment and Demers hire align with the narrative that Intel is refocusing on AI workloads and foundry partnerships, potentially supporting the idea that a clearer product roadmap can improve competitiveness and customer trust.\n\nThese moves also test the concern that organizational complexity and slow AI adaptation can hold Intel back, because successfully integrating an external startup and a senior GPU leader requires faster decision making and tighter execution than in the past.\n\nThe specific exposure to AI accelerators and software centric AI platforms through SambaNova is not fully captured in a general AI and foundry narrative, so investors may want to factor in how this partnership could change Intel’s mix of revenue and R&D priorities over time.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Intel to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ Intel already faces execution challenges in manufacturing and product rollouts, so adding another AI partnership and a new GPU leader could stretch management focus and prolong the time it takes for these efforts to show up in results.\n\n⚠️ Competition from Nvidia, AMD and specialized AI chip players means that even with SambaNova and a high profile GPU architect, Intel still has to convince hyperscalers that its AI stack is differentiated enough to win design slots.\n\n🎁 If Intel can integrate SambaNova’s AI hardware and software know-how with its CPU and foundry offerings, it could offer more complete solutions for cloud and enterprise buyers looking to standardize on fewer suppliers.\n\n🎁 Analysts have highlighted both risks and rewards for Intel, and this AI focused move relates directly to the potential reward that comes from better aligning Intel’s products with the long term growth in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nFrom here, you may want to track whether Intel and SambaNova announce concrete co-developed products, reference customers or design wins with large cloud providers and enterprises. Progress updates from Intel on how Demers is shaping its GPU roadmap, and how those GPUs are positioned against Nvidia and AMD in AI training and inference, will also matter. On the financial side, watch for any management commentary on how AI accelerators, GPUs and related software contribute to the data center segment, and whether these investments change Intel’s capital allocation priorities.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kla-shares-drop-15-post-165700060.html",
      "Content": "KLA Corporation KLAC shares dropped 15.1% post second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Jan. 29. The plunge can be attributed to the company’s not-so-impressive guidance, as well as operational headwinds. KLA now expects third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $3.35 billion (+/- $150 million), reflecting a modestly weak product mix on a sequential basis. The guidance also reflects the rapidly escalating cost of DRAM chips used in KLA’s image processing computers that ship with its systems, thereby hurting gross margin. Increasing lead times of its products due to supply constraints and negative tariff impact, roughly 100 bps, are headwinds in the near term.\n\nSo, what should investors do with KLA shares? Let’s find out?\n\nKLA shares have jumped 90.6% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 23.1% and the Zacks Electronics-Miscellaneous Products industry’s appreciation of 37.4%. KLA is benefiting from its dominant process control market share, strong AI infrastructure investment and momentum in advanced packaging.\n\nThe company has outperformed peers, including Applied Materials AMAT, ASML Holding ASML and Axcelis Technologies ACLS, in the past year. Shares of Applied Materials, ASML Holding and Axcelis have returned 81.9%, 87% and 48.1%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKLA is benefiting from strong demand for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging, which is driving top-line growth. Advanced packaging revenues are expected to grow mid-to-high teens on a year-over-year basis in 2026. Strong investments in WFE and advanced packaging represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. Growth of advanced packaging supporting heterogeneous chip integration has become a new market for KLA, which is currently worth $11 billion and growing faster than core WFE.\n\nKLA’s robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. Process control accelerates time to results by resolving process integration challenges during the fab ramp-up phase to optimize time to market for a diverse mix of semiconductor designs.\n\nMoreover, the growing investment in custom silicon, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of unique device designs. This has put customers under pressure to deliver performance, volume and time to market, resulting in strong demand for advanced process control. This aids KLA’s prospects as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology and yield optimization solutions. This bodes well for KLAC’s top-line growth.\n\nKLAC expects the core WFE market to grow in the high single to low double digits in 2026, reaching the low $120 billion range, up from approximately $110 billion in 2025. The company expects the advanced packaging component of the market to grow at a similar rate to roughly $12 billion for a total market forecast in the mid-$130 billion range, an increase in the low double digits versus its forecast for 2025.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $36.58 per share, up 3% over the past 30 days and indicating 9.9% growth from 2025’s reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $13.39 billion, suggesting 10.1% growth from the 2025’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Corporation price-consensus-chart | KLA Corporation Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $9.12 per share, up 2.4% over the past 30 days and indicating 8.4% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $3.37 billion, suggesting 9.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nKLAC shares are trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), KLAC is trading at 33.83X, higher than the broader sector and peers. The broader sector is trading at 26.08X while Applied Materials and Axcelis trade at 32.21X and 20.17X, respectively. However, ASML is pricey with a P/E multiple of 41.48.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnically, KLA is currently trading above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKLA benefits from strong demand for advanced packaging despite increasing lead times and conservative guidance. Robust AI demand bodes well for KLAC’s prospects and justifies a premium valuation.\n\nKLA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which suggests that investors should start accumulating the stock right now as the dip offers a massive opportunity.

      "Content": "Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Gold.com GOLD as the Bull of the Day and Qualcomm QCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc.&rsquo;s MU .\n\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\n\nA recent pullback in Gold.com stock may be short-lived as gold prices have rebounded to new record highs of over $5,000 per ounce, as shown below, following a sharp pullback to around $4,400 per ounce earlier in the month.\n\nAmid an unprecedented commodity price boom for various precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s stock has been one of the market&rsquo;s top performers in 2026 so far, soaring nearly +90% through the first two months of the year and recently hitting a 52-week high of $66 a share.\n\nOffering a fully integrated alternative assets platform, sentiment continues to build for Gold.com&rsquo;s outlook after reporting impressive results for its fiscal second quarter last Thursday and attracting positive attention from analysts in the process.\n\nHeadquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and formerly known as A-Mark Precious Metals, Gold.com provides an array of precious metals, including minted gold bars, silver, platinum, and palladium, along with copper bullion and numismatic coins to wholesale and retail consumers.\n\nStrong Q2 Results & Strategic Expansion\n\nEnforcing the narrative that Gold.com is executing well, Q2 sales spiked 136% year over year to a quarterly record of $6.47 billion from $2.74 billion in the comparative quarter. Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\n\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\n\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\n\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\n\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\n\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\n\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\n\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nQualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\n\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\n\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\n\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\n\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\n\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\n\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\n\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\n\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\n\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\n\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nMicron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\n\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\n\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\n\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\n\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\n\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\n\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\n\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\n\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\n\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated Feb. 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners, LLC. increased its position in Yeti by 373,641 shares during the fourth quarter of 2025. The estimated value of the additional shares acquired was $14.37 million, based on the average quarterly closing price. At quarter-end, the total Yeti position was valued at $134.08 million, up approximately $45.76 million from the prior period, reflecting both trading and price movement effects.\n\nAfter this buy, Yeti accounted for approximately 4.02% of 13F reportable AUM at the end of December 2025.\n\nTop holdings after the filing, other than Yeti:\n\nUNK: FCNCA: $167 million (approximately 5.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.9 million (approximately 4.4% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $133 million (approximately 4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.7 million (approximately 3.8% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: SKWD: $123.5 million (approximately 3.7% of AUM)\n\nAs of Feb. 10, 2026, shares were priced at $47.06, up approximately 30.2% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 by 15.79 percentage points.\n\nMetric\n\nValue\n\nMarket capitalization\n\n$3.66 billion\n\nRevenue (TTM)\n\n$1.83 billion\n\nNet income (TTM)\n\n$160.31 million\n\nPrice (as of market close February 10, 2026)\n\n$47.06\n\nYeti offers hard and soft coolers, drinkware, bags, outdoor living gear, and accessories primarily under the YETI and Rambler brands.\n\nThe company generates revenue through direct-to-consumer e-commerce, independent retailers, and international distribution channels.\n\nIt targets outdoor enthusiasts, recreation consumers, and specialty retail shoppers in the United States and select international markets.\n\nYeti designs premium coolers and drinkware for outdoor enthusiasts, leveraging a multi-channel strategy to reach a broad consumer base. The company is a leading designer and distributor of premium outdoor products, focusing on durable coolers and innovative drinkware. Its consistent growth reflects strong positioning within the leisure and outdoor recreation market.\n\nThis new filing comes about one week before Yeti releases fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2025 financial results on Thursday, Feb. 19. Investment firm Reinhart Partners is clearly confident in the business. But interested investors should watch the upcoming report closely.\n\nThat’s because Yeti’s business has been under pressure recently. Its products are certainly discretionary for consumers who may be looking to tighten their financial spending. That’s not the company’s only issue, either.\n\nIn the third quarter, Yeti’s adjusted earnings per share decreased 14%, even as net sales increased 2%. The company cited the “unfavorable net impact from higher tariff costs in the third quarter” as the reason. Yeti’s international sales actually increased by 14%, while sales in the U.S. declined 1%.\n\nThe company continues to innovate, however. Management is confident enough to increase its share repurchase target to $300 million. Yeti also updated fiscal year guidance slightly to the high end of prior projections for sales and free cash flow.\n\nYeti is also transforming its supply chain and diversifying its manufacturing footprint to address tariff and supplier issues. That work is likely why Reinhart Partners added more Yeti to the portfolio. The upcoming fourth-quarter report will help investors determine whether tariff and supply chain headwinds are now in the past.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Yeti, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Yeti wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Investors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\n\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\n\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\n\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-silicon-motion-140003883.html",
      "Content": "Silicon Motion (SIMO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this chip company have returned +15.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Silicon Motion belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +90%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +25.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52.7%. This estimate has changed +21.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.93 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $299.65 million indicates a year-over-year change of +80%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.24 billion and $1.41 billion estimates indicate +39.5% and +14.2% changes, respectively.\n\nSilicon Motion reported revenues of $278.46 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +45.7%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $0.91 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $261.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.61%. The EPS surprise was -2.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Silicon Motion surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSilicon Motion is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sunpower-kapil-rai-named-evp-130000831.html",
      "Content": "Period of Transformational Growth\n\nOREM, Utah, Feb. 11, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SunPower Inc. (herein “SunPower,” the “Company,” or Nasdaq: “SPWR”) a solar technology, services, and installation company, today announced the promotion of Kapil Rai to be EVP of the New Homes division, which also includes the Multifamily and Light Commercial (C&I) segments. His mandate is to strengthen partnerships with builders, installation partners, financing companies, OEM suppliers, and customers nationwide.\n\nKapil brings over 20 years of global P&L leadership from the semiconductor industry, where he worked for Future Electronics, Maxim Integrated, Cypress Semiconductor, and Microchip Technology.\n\nSunPower CEO, T.J. Rodgers, said, “Our New Homes division lost customers following the old-SunPower bankruptcy in 2024, but we now see a turnaround. We expect the division to double in size in 2026, and its project pipeline to exceed $100 million by year end. This momentum is underpinned by the recent acquisition of Cobalt Power, the No. 1 solar company in Silicon Valley, which Kapil successfully completed. Since joining SunPower last fall, he has moved quickly to rebuild the New Homes organization, re-established critical relationships, strengthened operations, and rigorous quality standards. Kapil previously delivered similar results in Cypress’s Microcontroller Division, where he raised its Net Promoter Score (NPS) by more than 40 points .”\n\nKapil Rai, EVP New Homes division said, “I am honored to have the opportunity to guide the transformation of the New Homes division. SunPower’s culture is rapidly becoming one of transparency, accountability, and zero-defects – values I’ve learned are essential in delivering long-lasting customer – and shareholder – value.”\n\nAbout SunPower\nSunPower (Nasdaq: SPWR) is a leading residential solar services provider in North America. The Company’s digital platform and installation services support energy needs for customers wishing to make the transition to a more energy-efficient lifestyle.

      "Content": "The flash-crash rally hit a speed bump on Tuesday after the disappointing December retail sales report.\n\nToday’s January non-farm payrolls report and Friday’s consumer price index numbers could move the markets.\n\nWith earnings for the fourth quarter all but over, economic data could play a bigger role the rest of the month.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nFutures are trading higher after a stellar and surprising January jobs report as we get to the middle of the trading week. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a winning day, closing up 0.20% at 50,188, the disappointment over the December retail sales report hung over the market like a sword of Damocles all day. With today's January non-farm payrolls report and the January consumer price index expected on Friday, economic data could drive markets. The S&P 500 closed Tuesday at 6,941, down 0.33%, while the Nasdaq closed at 23,021, lower by 0.59%. The Russell 2000 declined 0.24% to 2,682.\n\nYields were down again across the Treasury curve, and some traders attributed the buying to forthcoming economic data and the fact that two new voters for the Federal Reserve both stated that the Federal funds rate could remain where it is for some time, as they saw potential for inflation to reignite. The 30-year bond closed at 4.79%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.14%.\n\nPrices were modestly lower across the energy complex, with some attributing the move to profit-taking. Concern over a U.S.-Iranian confrontation remains central, and oil prices could spike if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. Ships were advised earlier this week to avoid Iranian waters, so the threat remains. Brent Crude closed down 0.11% at $68.93, while West Texas Intermediate finished Tuesday at $64.10, down 0.40%. Natural gas ended the day at $3.12, down 0.54%.\n\nGold was lower on Tuesday, as the same issues that weighed on the broader market also affected bullion. One positive noted by traders was that gold held above the $5,000 level, closing at $5,023, down 0.65%. Silver closed at $80.63, down 3.20%\n\nThe cryptocurrency market was range-bound and generally traded lower on Tuesday, as major tokens struggled to sustain recent gains and investors adopted a cautious stance ahead of critical U.S. economic data today and later this week. The crypto market remains pressured by ongoing liquidation-driven selling and a lack of fresh capital to drive prices higher, as evidenced by negative funding rates. Leveraged holders will likely be forced to refinance their holdings. At 8 AM EST, Bitcoin was trading at $67,201, while Ethereum was quoted at $1,957.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.\n\nHere are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, February 11, 2026.\n\nBETA Technologies Inc. (NYSE: BETA ) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Jefferies with a $30 target price.\n\nCloudflare Inc. ( NYSE: NET ) was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Baird, which raised the target price for the stock to $260 from $230.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods Inc. ( NYSE: DKS ) was raised to Outperform from Neutral at Baird, and the price target for the retail giant was raised to $253 from $230.\n\nMonro Inc. (NASDAQ: MNRO) was upgraded to Outperform from Perform at Oppenheimer with a $40 target price.\n\nTyler Technologies Inc. (NYSE: TYL ) was raised to Buy from Neutral at DA Davidson, which actually lowered the target price for the company to $460 from $510.\n\nBP Plc. (NYSE: BP) was downgraded to Sell from Buy at Melius Research with a $31 target price.\n\nMattel Inc. (NYSE: MAT ) was downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JPMorgan, which trimmed the target price for the toy giant to $14 from $23.\n\nNoble Corp. plc ( NYSE: NE ) was cut to Hold from Buy at Fearnley with a $38 target price.\n\nQualcomm Inc. ( NASDAQ: QCOM ) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Daiwa, which has a $140 target for the legacy tech giant.\n\nXPO Inc. ( NYSE: XPO ) was cut Neutral from Positive at Susquehanna with a $210 target price.\n\nBridge Bio Oncology Therapeutics, Inc. ( NASDAQ: BBOT) was started with a Buy rating at Stifel, which has a $23 target for the stock.\n\nEnergy Fuels Inc. ( NYSE: UUUU ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Goldman Sachs, with a $30 target price.\n\nJefferson Capital Inc. ( NASDAQ: JCAP ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Texas Capital with a $28 target price.\n\nSamsara Inc. ( NYSE: IOT ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Goldman Sachs, which has set a $36 target price objective.\n\nVelo3D Inc. ( NASDAQ: VELO ) was started with a Buy rating at Lucid Capital, with a $25 target price.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

The 1 year total shareholder return of 50.79% contrasts with a modest 5 year total shareholder return of 4.78%, hinting that enthusiasm around edge AI launches and fresh financing is a relatively recent shift in market sentiment.\n\nIf edge AI and power efficient chips are on your radar, it could be a good moment to widen your watchlist with our screener of 33 AI infrastructure stocks .\n\nAfter such a sharp move in the share price and with a fresh edge AI story in the spotlight, the real question now is whether Microchip still trades at a discount or if the market is already pricing in future growth.\n\nAt $76.86, the most followed narrative pegs Microchip Technology's fair value closer to $86.96, framing the recent AI driven enthusiasm against longer term assumptions.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\n\nCurious what sits behind that fair value gap?

      "Content": "Shares of analog chips maker onsemi (NASDAQ:ON) jumped 3.1% in the afternoon session after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results where earnings per share beat analyst estimates, but revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter fell short. The analog chip maker posted an adjusted EPS of $0.64, beating the consensus estimate of $0.62. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, in line with expectations but representing an 11.2% decline from the previous year. However, the positive earnings surprise was tempered by the company's forecast for the first quarter, which projected both revenue and earnings below Wall Street's projections. Despite the weak outlook, investors appeared to focus on the better-than-expected profit and a strong free cash flow margin of 31.7% for the quarter. The stock's rally represented a significant reversal from an initial 4.6% drop immediately following the earnings release, suggesting a shift in sentiment as the market digested the full report.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $66.82, up 1.7% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy onsemi? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free .\n\nonsemi’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 18 days ago when the stock dropped 2.7% on the news that Intel reported disappointing earnings report and weak forecast for the current quarter. Shares of the chipmaker plunged about 12% after it posted a fourth-quarter loss and provided a softer-than-expected outlook. The company's first-quarter revenue projections of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion fell short of analyst consensus. More concerning for the broader sector, Intel executives flagged industry-wide supply shortages as a significant problem that could persist into 2026, with supply capabilities expected to be at their lowest point in the first quarter. When a market leader like Intel signals such widespread issues, it often creates a ripple effect, raising investor concerns about the health and near-term prospects of the entire semiconductor industry.\n\nonsemi is up 17.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $66.82 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of onsemi’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,674.\n\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

      "Content": "KLA Corporation recently reported past second-quarter fiscal 2026 results showing higher revenue of US$3,297.15 million and net income of US$1,145.68 million year over year, alongside issuing guidance for third-quarter revenue of about US$3.35 billion and GAAP diluted EPS between US$8.07 and US$9.63.\n\nIn parallel, KLA’s board affirmed a quarterly dividend of US$1.90 per share and the company completed a multi-year share repurchase totaling 18,859,237 shares for US$9.06 billion, underscoring its continued emphasis on returning cash to shareholders while semiconductor demand related to AI investment remains a key theme in its commentary.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we will explore how KLA’s strong earnings performance and capital return program shape the company’s broader investment narrative.\n\nCapitalize on the AI infrastructure supercycle with our selection of the 33 best 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush converting record-breaking demand into massive cash flow.\n\nTo own KLA, you need to be comfortable tying your fortunes to wafer fab equipment spending and, increasingly, AI-driven capacity investments. The latest quarter’s higher revenue and earnings, coupled with Q3 guidance, reinforce that near term demand remains intact for now, even if that may not materially change the existing catalysts around AI-related tool orders and the broader semiconductor capex cycle. The affirmed US$1.90 dividend and completion of a US$9.06 billion buyback fit neatly into KLA’s pattern of returning substantial cash, but they do not remove the key risks: potential swings in wafer fab budgets, high valuation multiples versus “fair” estimates, and reliance on a few large chip manufacturers. Instead, this news mainly strengthens the sense that management is leaning into the current industry upturn.\n\nHowever, investors should also be aware of how quickly wafer fab spending plans can reset. KLA's shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? Uncover how much higher they are than fair value .\n\nThe three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$758 to US$1,297 per share, showing how far apart private investors can be. Set against KLA’s strong recent earnings and sizable capital returns, this spread invites you to weigh differing expectations for future AI-driven equipment demand and the risk that spending could cool faster than many anticipate.\n\nExplore 3 other fair value estimates on KLA - why the stock might be worth as much as $1297!\n\nDisagree with this assessment? Create your own narrative in under 3 minutes - extraordinary investment returns rarely come from following the herd.\n\nA great starting point for your KLA research is our analysis highlighting 3 key rewards that could impact your investment decision.\n\nOur free KLA research report provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate KLA's overall financial health at a glance.\n\nThe market won't wait.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amat-climbs-8-month-time-163600277.html",
      "Content": "Applied Materials AMAT shares have risen 7.6% in a month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s decline of 1.6% and 0.1%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe rise in the stock price has made AMAT a premium, as it trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.67, which is above the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s P/S ratio of 8.46.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven AMAT’s stock price rise in the past month and its overvaluation at present, investors might question: Should they buy, hold or sell the stock? Let’s discuss the fundamentals in detail.\n\nAMAT specializes in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Recent launches like Xtera epi, Kinex hybrid bonding, and PROVision 10 eBeam will add to AMAT’s growth story.\n\nAMAT expects next-generation technologies to be produced in large volume, which means that the company’s customers will be ramping up their foundries, naturally benefiting AMAT’s business. In 2025, AMAT strengthened its leadership in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50%. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\n\nAMAT expects its leading-edge foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory and high bandwidth memory to be the fastest-growing wafer fabrication equipment businesses in 2026. AMAT’s advanced packaging business, which is currently valued at $1.5 billion, is still on track to double to $3 billion over the next few years, driven by HBM demand and next-generation packaging architectures.\n\nThese factors will contribute to increased traction in Applied Materials’ wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), driven by growing usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing. AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT restructured its pricing program, and it is expected to contribute most of the 120-bps gross margin expansion in the coming fiscal year. This cost restructuring will further provide AMAT with enough headroom to ramp up its R&D investments. AMAT is setting up the Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization center for research, which is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nApplied Materials is winning over its competition like KLA Corporation KLAC, Lam Research LRCX and ASML Holding ASML in the semiconductor supply chain market.\n\nLam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although they develop solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holdings develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions like Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\n\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\n\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in GAA transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nWith these factors in place, AMAT’s long-term growth outlook remains strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 revenues are expected to rise 13.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 earnings is expected to grow 22% year over year. AMAT's fiscal 2027 earnings estimates have been revised upward in the past 30 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging, driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing, is a tailwind for AMAT stock. Considering these long-term growth factors, we suggest investors book this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock at present.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lam-research-stocks-high-p-150000625.html",
      "Content": "Lam Research Corporation LRCX, a leader in semiconductor fabrication equipment, currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38.14, significantly higher than the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry average of 32.\n\nLRCX’s P/E multiple is also higher than that of some other semiconductor fabrication equipment providers, including KLA Corporation KLAC, Onto Innovation Inc. ONTO and Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT. At present, KLA Corporation, Onto Innovation and Applied Materials have a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 34.16, 33.78 and 31.60, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLRCX’s lofty valuation multiple is a result of robust appreciation in its share price. In the trailing 12 months, Lam Research shares have soared 174.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 35.1%. It has also outpaced the returns of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation. Shares of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation have rallied 90%, 80.4% and 21.6%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough it seems investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock, the billion-dollar question is: Is it justified to overpay?\n\nIn our opinion, Lam Research’s strong growth prospects amid artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand for advanced nodes justify this premium valuation. The company’s high growth potential in AI and high-performance computing (HPC) markets, along with back-to-back quarters of strong financial performance, suggest that LRCX stock’s upward momentum is far from over.\n\nDespite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical issues, and trade and tariff wars, LRCX’s financials remain impressive. In the company’s last reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, total revenues rose 22% year over year to $5.34 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%, primarily driven by continued demand across the Systems and Customer Support Business Group segments.\n\nLam Research reported second-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.27 per share, which beat the consensus mark by 8.5%. The bottom line also increased 39.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nLam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation Quote\n\nExpanding its manufacturing operations in Asia has also helped the company lower costs and improve margins. In the second quarter, Lam Research’s non-GAAP operating margin rose to 34.3%, up 360 basis points from the year-ago quarter, which is impressive, considering the challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThis strong financial performance reinforces Lam Research’s resilience in navigating an evolving semiconductor cycle. As demand grows for advanced nodes, LRCX’s specialized technology in etch and deposition tools for high-aspect-ratio structures positions it well to capitalize on this trend. The company’s second-quarter results also highlight its effective cost management, which has enabled sustained profitability.\n\nLam Research is capitalizing on AI trends. It builds the tools chipmakers need to manufacture next-generation semiconductors, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and chips used in advanced packaging. These technologies are vital for powering AI and cloud data centers.\n\nLam Research’s products are not only critical but also innovative. For example, its ALTUS ALD tool uses molybdenum to improve speed and efficiency in chip production. Another product, the Aether platform, helps chipmakers achieve higher performance and density. These are essential capabilities as demand for advanced AI chips continues to increase.\n\nIn 2025, Lam Research’s revenues from advanced packaging grew significantly, and management anticipates strong 40% year-over-year growth for 2026. The industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents growth opportunities for LRCX’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.\n\nThese trends are aiding Lam Research’s financial performance. The company has demonstrated consistent execution, maintaining quarterly revenues of more than $5 billion for the past three consecutive quarters, reflecting solid demand from leading chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung.\n\nWith AI-driven investments accelerating, Lam Research’s leading position in etch and deposition makes it a key beneficiary of the ongoing semiconductor spending cycle. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenues implies a year-over-year increase of 19.5% and 21.2%, respectively. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings per share indicates growth of 26.1% and 24.4%, respectively.\n\nLam Research’s solid financial performance and strategic focus on AI-driven growth make it a compelling investment option right now despite lofty valuations. The company’s expanding market share in AI and datacenter fabrication, coupled with innovative product launches, strengthens its competitive positioning.\n\nCurrently, Lam Research sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Have you evaluated the performance of Texas Instruments' (TXN) international operations for the quarter ending December 2025? Given the extensive global presence of this chipmaker, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nInternational market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.\n\nWhile analyzing TXN's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.42 billion, showing rise of 10.4%. We will now explore the breakdown of TXN's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\n\nDuring the quarter, Japan contributed $290 million in revenue, making up 6.6% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $297.43 million, this meant a surprise of -2.5%. Looking back, Japan contributed $313 million, or 6.6%, in the previous quarter, and $277 million, or 6.9%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nRest of World generated $98 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 2.2% of the total. This represented a surprise of +26.34% compared to the $77.57 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of World accounted for $74 million (1.6%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $69 million (1.7%) to the total revenue.\n\nOf the total revenue, $948 million came from Europe, Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 21.4%. This represented a surprise of +3.13% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $919.21 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $972 million, or 20.5%, and $786 million, or 19.6%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nRest of Asia accounted for 10.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $457 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -4.19%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $476.96 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Rest of Asia contributed $505 million (10.7%) and $432 million (10.8%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nChina generated $951 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 21.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +1.9% compared to the $933.3 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, China accounted for $1.02 billion (21.5%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $821 million (20.5%) to the total revenue.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Texas Instruments to report $4.51 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 11% from the year-ago quarter. Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to contribute 6.5% (translating to $293.26 million), 1.7% ($77.37 million), 20.5% ($925.54 million), 10.5% ($473.62 million), and 20.7% ($933.44 million) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $19.36 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 9.5% from the year before. The revenues from Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to make up 6.4%, 1.7%, 20%, 10.3%, and 20.5% of this total, corresponding to $1.24 billion, $322.14 million, $3.86 billion, $2 billion, and $3.97 billion, respectively.\n\nTexas Instruments' reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\n\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\n\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\n\nTexas Instruments, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term.

      "Content": "The S&P 500 is off to a fairly underwhelming start. As of Monday's close, it was up less than 2% since January. Many growth stocks have been struggling, while dividend stocks are suddenly becoming hot buys.\n\nTwo dividend stocks that are off to hot starts since the beginning of the year are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) . They have soared past the broad index, and here's why it might not be too late to invest in them.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nEntering trading on Tuesday, Lockheed Martin's stock was up 32% year to date. It's a fantastic performance after an unexciting year in 2025, when its share price was flat.\n\nThe company posted some strong earnings numbers at the end of January, reporting that its backlog was a record $194 billion. Its numbers came in better than its own expectations, and the business said it experienced \"unprecedented demand\" in the previous year. With strong government relationships and more growth expected for 2026, it's little wonder the defense stock has been a good buy early on.\n\nIts yield of 2.2% is also about twice what you'd get with the average S&P 500 stock right now. And at 21 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst projections), it's not an expensive stock to own, either. For long-term investors, Lockheed Martin can be a great stock to buy and hold.\n\nAnother stock that's been red hot to start 2026 is semiconductor company Texas Instruments. It's up just over 26% and it also recently released its earnings numbers. For the last three months of 2025, its revenue of $4.4 billion rose by 10% year over year, as demand from data centers has been strong and driving a lot of growth for the business.\n\nIts diversified semiconductor business features more than 80,000 parts that help companies in various industries, making it an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33 is a bit high, but with some encouraging long-term growth prospects and its data center segment potentially being a catalyst for the foreseeable future, the stock can still be a suitable option for investors who are looking to buy and hold for years.\n\nTexas Instruments pays an above-average dividend that yields 2.6%, and it has been increasing its payout for 22 consecutive years. This is not only a promising growth investment, but also a terrific dividend stock to hang on to for the long haul.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,299 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,136,601 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 914 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor , and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 10, 2026.\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Texas Instruments. The Motley Fool recommends Lockheed Martin.

      "Content": "Stellar P3E MCUs\n\nSTMicroelectronics introduces the first automotive microcontroller with AI acceleration for edge intelligence\n\nStellar P3E automotive microcontroller (MCU) enables real-time AI applications at the edge significantly enhancing vehicle intelligence\n\nSimplifies multi-function integration for X-in-1 Electronic Control Units\n\nDelivers flexible, real-time performance for safe, responsive applications from hybrid/EV systems to body zonal architectures\n\nGeneva, February 10, 2026 -- STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) , a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, today announced the Stellar P3E , the first automotive microcontroller (MCU) with built-in AI acceleration for automotive edge intelligence. Designed for future software-defined vehicles, the Stellar P3E simplifies multi-function integration for X-in-1 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that reduce system cost, weight, and complexity.\n\n“Stellar P3E sets a new benchmark for automotive electrification by combining high-performance real-time control and edge AI in a single device that meets the highest automotive safety levels,” said Luca Rodeschini, Group Vice President and General Purpose and Automotive Microcontrollers Division General Manager, STMicroelectronics. “Its increased processing power, AI acceleration, large and extensible memory, rich analogue content, smart sensing capabilities, and intelligent power management functions support new applications such as virtual sensors. This better enables automakers with the tools to create safer, more efficient and more responsive driving experiences.”\n\nA defining feature of the Stellar P3E is its integrated ST Neural-ART Accelerator™ for real-time AI efficiency —making it the first MCU with an embedded neural network accelerator for the automotive industry. Powered by this dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) with an advanced data-flow architecture for AI workloads, and combined with its rich sensing capabilities, the P3E enables smart sensing that opens the door to new applications such as virtual sensors.\n\nThe P3E delivers inference processing at microsecond speeds, achieving up to 30x greater efficiency compared to traditional MCU core processors. This enables always-on, low-power artificial intelligence (AI) that can support real-time functions, including predictive maintenance and smart sensing, delivering significant benefits across a wide range of applications. For example, these capabilities can enhance charging speed and efficiency in electric vehicles and enable rapid deployment of new features, whether in the factory or in the field. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can introduce new functions and more intuitive behaviors through different AI models, reducing the need for additional sensors, modules, wiring, and integration effort.\n\n“Shifting neural processing from centralized hubs to the edge of the vehicle enables sub millisecond-level decision-making, which is essential for the next generation of in-vehicle intelligence. Integrating AI hardware acceleration at the MCU level allows OEMs to deliver advanced capabilities, such as predictive maintenance for vehicle performance and smart sensing with virtual sensor applications. This enables very low latency sensing, actuation control, and other sophisticated features, without the cost and thermal burden of a full-scale SoC,” said Greg Basich, Associate Director, Counterpoint Research.\n\nAs the automotive industry embraces the shift toward software-defined vehicles (SDVs), Stellar P3E’s integrated xMemory, ST’s proprietary non-volatile memory based on phase-change memory (PCM) , provides the essential scalability and flexibility needed. Offering twice the density of traditional embedded flash memory and qualified for automotive environments, this extensible memory solution enables dynamic expansion of software storage to accommodate new features and updates without requiring any hardware redesign.\n\nThe P3E is fully supported within the ST Edge AI Suite , a comprehensive edge-AI ecosystem that spans from dataset creation to on-device deployment for data scientists and embedded engineers. As part of this suite, NanoEdge AI Studio tool is now available for the entire Stellar MCU family. In addition, the Stellar P3E is already integrated into Stellar Studio , ST’s all-in-one development environment tailored for automotive engineers. Together they reinforce a robust hardware and software ecosystem designed to streamline the deployment of sophisticated edge AI solutions in demanding automotive environments.\n\nThe start of production of the Stellar P3E is planned in the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nKey technical highlights :\n\n500 MHz Arm® Cortex®-R52+ cores delivering the highest CoreMark score in its class - exceeding 8,000 points.\n\nSplit-lock architecture enabling designers to optimize the balance between functional safety and peak performance.\n\nOpen Arm architecture, leveraging a vast global developer community for accelerated innovation.\n\nRich I/O and analog capabilities support diverse functions, including advanced motor control for enhanced vehicle dynamics.\n\nAbout STMicroelectronics\n\nAt ST, we are 48,000 creators and makers of semiconductor technologies mastering the semiconductor supply chain with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. An integrated device manufacturer, we work with more than 200,000 customers and thousands of partners to design and build products, solutions, and ecosystems that address their challenges and opportunities, and the need to support a more sustainable world.

      "Content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus .\n\nAmazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) Web Services appears to be tightening its grip on critical data-center infrastructure by deepening its relationship with STMicroelectronics NV ( NYSE:STM ), as the cloud unit looks to secure a broader range of semiconductor technologies for its hyperscale operations. Under the agreement disclosed on Monday, STMicro will supply AWS with chips supporting high-bandwidth connectivity and energy-efficient power management, components that are increasingly relevant as AI workloads place heavier demands on data-center performance and power efficiency. The structure of the deal suggests AWS is positioning itself not just as a customer, but as a long-term partner as global data-center build-outs accelerate.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN.\n\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nAlongside the commercial supply arrangement, AWS received warrants to acquire up to 24.8 million ordinary STMicro shares, with vesting linked to AWS's purchases of STMicro products over time. The warrants can be exercised over a seven-year period at an initial exercise price of $28.38, giving AWS the flexibility to build an equity position in stages. STMicro shares rose 6.5% at the market open to $26.51 following the announcement, while for AWS the move represents at least its second investment in a semiconductor company, reinforcing the view that cloud operators could increasingly blend procurement and capital allocation to secure strategic supply.\n\nThe backdrop to the agreement is a widening semiconductor opportunity driven by AI-related data-center investment, where demand is extending beyond advanced processors into analog chips used for power management, sensing, and cooling. STMicro, which supplies customers such as Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), recently forecast first-quarter revenue that came in above analysts' expectations, with consumer electronics demand showing signs of recovery late last year after a prolonged slump. At the same time, management has cautioned that the rebound remains uneven, with Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery noting that the automotive market is not yet stable, suggesting that AI-driven infrastructure demand could be an important, though not uniform, support for the company's outlook.",

      "Content": "Applied Materials AMAT is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 12.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, AMAT expects revenues to be $6.85 billion (+/- $500 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.89 billion, suggesting a decline of 3.87% from the year-ago quarter’s reading.\n\nApplied Materials projects non-GAAP earnings to be $2.18 (+/- $0.20). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.19 per share, indicating a decline of 7.98% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The figure has remained unchanged in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMAT has an impressive earnings surprise history. AMAT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 4.17%.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for AMAT this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($2.26 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.19 per share), is +3.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: AMAT carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nAMAT’s wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) is experiencing increased demand due to a rise in the usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing (HPC). In the previous quarter, AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT’s flash memory or NAND sales nearly doubled to $1.41 billion in fiscal 2025 from the year-ago sales of $747.4 million. Although AMAT has a lower market share in the NAND space, it is gaining prominence. This trend is likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, supporting AMAT’s top-line growth.\n\nApplied Materials’ leadership in GAA transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips, are likely to have driven AMAT’s semiconductor segment in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nAMAT’s display business has rebounded in the fiscal 2025 with year-over-year growth of 19.8%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the display revenues grew 68.2% year over year as Applied Materials shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly. These factors are likely to have benefited AMAT’s corporate and other segment’s revenues.\n\nThe company’s Applied Global Services segment is also likely to have seen steady growth, aided by strong demand for comprehensive service agreements and the expansion of its subscription-based business.\n\nApplied Materials shares have gained 74.9% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which has gained 19.4%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet us now look at the value Applied Materials offers to its investors at current levels. AMAT is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 8.46X compared with the industry’s 8.26X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApplied Materials operates in a highly competitive market space where it faces competition from players, including Lam Research LRCX in the semiconductor space, ASML Holding ASML in the photolithography and advanced manufacturing equipment segment. KLA Corporation KLAC is a dominant competitor in the wafer inspection space.\n\nFor instance, Lam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although developing solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holding develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions, such as Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\n\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\n\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nAMAT is gaining from continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and HPC. AMAT’s HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology technologies are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Considering these factors, we suggest investors buy this stock now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cirrus-logic-inc-crus-soars-141505325.html",
      "Content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS) ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $144.76 in the previous session. Cirrus Logic has gained 20.5% since the start of the year compared to the -0.6% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 3.2% return for the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry.\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 3, 2026, Cirrus Logic reported EPS of $2.97 versus consensus estimate of $2.42.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Cirrus Logic is expected to post earnings of $8.51 per share on $1.94 in revenues. This represents a 12.86% change in EPS on a 2.35% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.77 per share on $2.03 in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.03% and 4.48%, respectively.\n\nThough Cirrus Logic has recently hit a 52-week high, what is next for Cirrus Logic? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). The individual style scores for Value, Growth, Momentum and the combined VGM Score run from A through F. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nCirrus Logic has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 37.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.4X versus its peer group's average of 23.4X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cirrus Logic currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cirrus Logic fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Cirrus Logic shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nShares of CRUS have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) . AMAT has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of D, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of A.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Applied Materials, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 2.84%, and for the current fiscal year, AMAT is expected to post earnings of $9.62 per share on revenue of $29.17 billion.\n\nShares of Applied Materials, Inc. have gained 7.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 33.53X and a P/CF of 31.95X.\n\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is in the top 25% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CRUS and AMAT, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Stock futures are slightly lower this morning after a Friday rally that pushed the Dow above 50,000 for the first time; investors are preparing for a big week of earnings reports and important economic data releases; Novo Nordisk shares are rising after Hims & Hers Health said over the weekend it would pull its compounded semaglutide pill, sending shares of the telehealth company sharply lower; Kroger shares are rising on news the supermarket chain has hired a new CEO; and STMicroelectronics shares are jumping after the European chipmaker announced a deal to supply Amazon. Here's what you need to know today.\n\nStock futures are down slightly Monday as investors look ahead to a busy week of earnings and economic reports. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were down 0.1% recently, while those linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The major indexes soared on Friday at the end of a volatile week of trading, with the Dow gaining 1,200 points to close above 50,000 for the first time. Bitcoin was at $69,000 this morning, down from a Sunday high of around $72,000 but well up from last week's low of around $60,000 , the cryptocurrency's lowest level since late 2024. Gold futures were recently up 1% at $5,030 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures ticked higher to $63.75 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.24%, up from 4.20% at Friday's close.\n\nInvestors are preparing for a busy week of earnings reports and the release of economic data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. The earnings calendar includes reports from iconic American brands such as McDonald's ( MCD ), The Coca-Cola Company ( KO ) and Ford Motor ( F ), as well as releases from CVS Health ( CVS ), AstraZeneca ( AZN ), T-Mobile ( TMUS ), Robinhood ( HOOD ), Coinbase ( COIN ), Spotify Technology ( SPOT ) and Airbnb ( ABNB ), among others. The January jobs report is scheduled for release on Wednesday morning, while the Consumer Price Index is due on Friday. The Fed, which has a dual mandate to maintain price stability while promoting maximum employment, will be watching the data closely.\n\nShares of Novo Nordisk ( NVO ) are rising while Hims & Hers Health ( HIMS ) shares are tumbling following the latest developments in the weight-loss drug wars. Hims & Hers said over the weekend that it will stop offering its compounded semaglutide pill just days after launching the product . The pill was marketed as having the same active ingredient as Novo's Wegovy pill that received FDA approval in December . The FDA said on Friday that it planned to \"take decisive steps to restrict\" the use of GLP-1 active ingredients in compounded versions of the popular weight loss medications, citing Hims & Hers by name in the statement. Novo Nordisk on Monday announced a lawsuit against Hims & Hers, saying it is asking a court to \"permanently ban Hims from selling unapproved, compounded drugs that infringe our patents, and is seeking to recover damages.\" Shares of Novo Nordisk were up more than 5% in recent premarket trading, while Hims shares sank 20% to their lowest levels since September 2024.\n\nKroger ( KR ) stock is gaining ground this morning following news the grocery giant has hired former Walmart ( WMT ) executive Greg Foran to be its CEO. The Wall Street Journal had reported on Sunday that the decision had been made and that an announcement was imminent. Foran served as head of Walmart's U.S. business from 2014 to 2019, before spending the next several years leading Air New Zealand as CEO. Kroger has been looking for a new CEO for nearly a year, since previous CEO Rodney McMullen was dismissed in March 2025 over an undisclosed ethics violation. Foran was identified as a potential candidate by Wall Street analysts in the weeks after McMullen was fired, as they said a former Walmart executive could help Kroger compete with the nation's largest retailer. Kroger's move comes at a busy time for executive changes in retail, as Walmart itself and rival Target ( TGT ) each recently welcomed new CEOs . Kroger shares were up 7% recently.\n\nShares of STMicroelectronics ( STM ) are surging after the European chipmaker announced a new deal with Amazon ( AMZN ). The company said Monday that it has agreed to a \"multi-year, multi-billion\" dollar deal to supply Amazon Web Services with a range of semiconductors. The chipmaker also said it has issued warrants that would allow Amazon to acquire up to 24.8 million shares in the company over the next several years as part of the deal. Amazon and other tech giants have laid out plans in recent weeks to substantially increase their spending on artificial intelligence projects this year, including building data centers and buying the equipment to run them. Amazon said last week its capital expenditures could reach up to $200 billion this year. U.S.-traded shares of STMicroelectronics were up 7% recently. Amazon stock was little changed after tumbling Friday following the company's announcement of the big spending plans and a weaker-than-expected earnings report.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia",

However, there's another chip stock that could also turn out to be a huge AI winner: Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) .\n\nNvidia makes high-powered parallel processing chips that act as the primary brains that undergird AI software. Texas Instruments makes analog chips, the boring ones that convert physical events into digital signals. When you push a button on a digital device, it is likely being controlled by an analog chip. Texas Instruments' chips are simple, relatively low cost, and can be found in tech products virtually everywhere.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor.

Given the expectation that the AI infrastructure buildout is only just beginning, Texas Instruments could have years of growth ahead of it in this end market.\n\nOver the last few years, the analog chip sector has been in a rut. However, Texas Instruments has been investing in new chip production capacity. Just recently, it agreed to buy competitor Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) . In other words, Texas Instruments is preparing for growth.\n\nIt is also shifting the way it reports its sales. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the company broke out its data center business as a separate end market. The segment accounted for around 9% of the top line. However, it grew 64% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat's probably not a number to bake into your growth expectations, given that the AI opportunity is brand new. Still, revenue rose by a mid-single-digit percentage from the third quarter. If this is just the beginning of the AI buildout, this segment could help supercharge an upturn in the typically cyclical analog chip sector and support growth for years to come.\n\nThere are other analog chipmakers , and there are chipmakers that make more exciting chips than Texas Instruments. However, for most investors, opening a position in this industry-leading company will probably set you up for long-term success. And given the strength of the business and the company's growth efforts, the AI buildout could easily turn Texas Instruments into a top-performing chipmaker by 2027, if not sooner.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Texas Instruments, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Texas Instruments wasn’t one of them.
