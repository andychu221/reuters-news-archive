      "Content": "Rivian narrows losses, targets R2 deliveries in Q2 2026\n\nShubhendu Vimal\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:19 AM PST 2 min read\n\nRivian Automotive reported full-year gross profit and said customer deliveries of the R2 electric vehicle are slated for the second quarter of 2026.\nThe US electric vehicle maker recorded consolidated gross profit of $144m in 2025, reversing a $1.2bn gross loss a year earlier.\nFor the full year, the net loss narrowed to $3.64bn from $4.74bn and full-year consolidated revenue rose 8% to $5.38bn.\n\nAutomotive revenue fell 15% to $3.83bn, while software and services revenue surged 222% to $1.55bn.\nRivian attributed the swing to gross profit to improved software and services performance, higher average selling prices and lower cost per vehicle.\nFor 2025, production and deliveries totalled 42,284 and 42,247 units respectively.\nThe company said R2 manufacturing preparations remain on schedule, with initial validation builds completed in mid-January 2026 using production tools at the Normal facility.\nThe launch model will be a dual-motor all-wheel-drive variant, with further details due on 12 March 2026.\nFourth-quarter gross profit reached $120m on revenue of $1.28bn, down from $170m on $1.734bn in the prior-year period.\nAutomotive revenue declined 45% year on year to $839m in the quarter, reflecting weaker regulatory credit sales, fewer deliveries after tax incentives expired, and a lower average selling price due to a greater share of electric delivery vans.\n\nBy contrast, software and services revenue jumped 109% to $447m, supported by vehicle electrical architecture and software development work tied to Rivian’s joint venture with Volkswagen Group, alongside stronger remarketing and after-sales activity.\nThe company posted a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $811m in the fourth quarter, versus $744m in 2024.\nRivian produced 10,974 vehicles and delivered 9,745 in the fourth quarter at its Normal, Illinois plant.\nDuring the quarter, Rivian rolled out its Universal Hands-Free assisted-driving feature for second-generation R1 vehicles across more than 3.5 million miles of roads in the US and Canada.\nIt also introduced Rivian Unified Intelligence, an AI-based software platform and a voice interface, Rivian Assistant.\n\nBy year-end, Rivian operated 36 retail locations, 97 service sites and nearly 700 mobile service vehicles.\nFor 2026, it forecasts deliveries of 62,000-67,000 vehicles, an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.80bn-$2.10bn and capital expenditure of $1.95bn-$2.05bn.\nRivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said: “In 2025 we focused on execution as we laid the foundation for dramatically scaling our business. Our Autonomy & AI Day in December unveiled our RAP1 Autonomy Processor, our autonomous driving platform and our AI-driven in-car Rivian Assistant. It’s incredibly exciting to see the early strong reviews of the R2 pre-production builds, and we can’t wait to get them to our customers next quarter.”\n\nStory Continues\n\"Rivian narrows losses, targets R2 deliveries in Q2 2026\" was originally created and published by Just Auto , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Here’s what to know about the cost, process, and potential long-term effects of each so you can make the right choice for your debt payoff.\n\nWhat are the differences between credit counseling and debt settlement? Credit counseling organizations and debt settlement companies have different approaches to helping you resolve your debt with lenders and creditors.\nWhen you work with a nonprofit credit counseling organization, you’ll typically have a meeting to discuss your financial situation so the counselor can determine if a debt management plan is right for you. If you opt into a debt management plan, the counselor works with your lenders on different options for repaying your debt, which may include lower interest rates, a lower monthly payment, or a longer repayment period. Credit counseling doesn’t typically reduce the amount of debt you owe, but it can make it easier to repay by making your monthly payment more affordable.\n\nDebt settlement companies, on the other hand, may reduce your debt balances through negotiations with your creditors . Those negotiations can lead to settlements, which may include a lower repayment amount.\nIt’s important to know that many lenders and creditors won’t work with debt settlement companies, and there’s no guarantee the company can successfully lower your debt. In fact, these companies often can't get better terms for your debt than you could by negotiating yourself, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\nHere are more details about how each process works:\nFees The fees you’ll pay for credit counseling and debt settlement will vary — but credit counseling is often much cheaper.\nFor credit counseling, your first session with a counselor is often free. The organization may also offer free financial education materials and tools.\nBut you should expect some fees when you enroll in a debt management plan through credit counseling. For example, you may pay a one-time fee when you start and then a flat monthly fee thereafter — though you may also qualify for fee waivers depending on your income and other factors.\nFor debt settlement, you’ll typically pay a percentage rather than a flat fee. The company may ask for a portion of the overall debt that the company resolves or a portion of the money that the company saves you from paying.\nWatch out for any debt settlement company that asks for an up-front payment, though. According to the CFPB, each of the following things must happen before a debt settlement company asks you to pay:\nThe company reaches a settlement or otherwise successfully negotiates with your creditor.\nYou agree to the terms with the creditor.\nYou make at least one payment to your creditor or lender under the new terms negotiated by the debt settlement company.\nHow you repay debt When you take on a debt management plan with a credit counseling service, you’ll make a monthly payment to the credit counselor, and they’ll pass on the payment that’s owed to each of your creditors. This can help you consolidate your debt into a single monthly payment that’s easier to track.\nWith debt settlement, you may be encouraged to stop making payments to your lenders during the negotiation period. Instead, you’ll typically contribute payments to a dedicated bank account. This account should be with a separate institution from the debt settlement company, and you can access it at any time.\nOnce the company reaches a settlement with your creditor or lender, they’ll use the money in that account to pay off your debt in a lump sum. If the debt settlement company doesn’t negotiate a settlement with your lender, you’ll still be responsible for paying any late fees and interest accumulated throughout that period.\nCredit impact If you have outstanding debt, it may already be affecting your credit. You can drive up your credit utilization when you spend close to your credit limit or max out your credit cards, and missed payments can be reported to the credit bureaus and appear on your credit report. If your debts go to collections, they will also have a negative effect on your credit.\nWhether you choose credit consolidation or debt settlement, you may also see some credit impact.\nBecause credit counseling often requires you to close your credit card accounts, your credit could take a temporary hit. But as you make payments toward your debt, building a positive payment history and lowering your credit utilization (since you won’t be using your cards or opening more credit), you can build your score back up.\nWith debt settlement, the biggest risk is that the debt settlement company is unable to reach a settlement with your creditors. Throughout the negotiation process, you may be asked to stop making monthly payments. If there’s no settlement later on, those missed payments can add up and result in negative information on your credit report, as well as a significant amount of late fees and penalties. Late payments and collections can remain on your credit report for seven years.\nRed flags to watch for There are scammers posing as both credit counseling organizations and debt settlement companies. Often, bad actors make false promises about your debt payoff and ask you for money up front.\nIf you opt for credit counseling, make sure you choose a reputable, nonprofit organization. Two sites you can use to find credit counselors include the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) and the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA) .\nAlways do your research on any debt settlement company before you agree to work with them, and look out for common red flags that a company may be scamming you, such as up-front fee charges, a guarantee to settle all of your debts, promising you can avoid any debt collections or lawsuits, and more.",

The market is benefiting from consumers treating cooking oils less like pantry staples and more like ingredient decisions tied to transparency, sourcing ethics, and \"no-bioengineered\" expectations . As food manufacturers and retailers intensify their focus on traceable, non-GMO-certified inputs, demand is rising across processed food, bakery, infant nutrition, and nutraceutical formulations—particularly where clean-label claims influence purchase behavior and labeling risk.\nMarket Snapshot: Non-GMO Oil Demand (2025–2035)\nNon-GMO oil market size (2025): USD 1,437.7 million\nNon-GMO oil market size (2035): USD 1,998.4 million\nForecast CAGR (2025–2035): 3.9%\nLeading segment (2025): Soybean oil (34.7% share)\nKey growth regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific\nHigh-potential demand pockets (named): Processed food, bakery, infant nutrition, nutraceuticals\nRetail dynamic (2025): Private label (~17.3% share)\nSpecialized nutrition dynamic (2025): Infant nutrition (~12.6% share)\nKey companies (named): Cargill Inc.; Archer Daniels Midland Company; Hain Celestial Group Inc.; Spectrum Organics; Centra Foods\n\nGet Access Report Sample: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-10963\nMarket Momentum: \"Non-GMO\" Moves from Niche Label to Procurement Standard\nNon-GMO oils are gaining traction because they reduce friction for brands operating in a world of ingredient scrutiny. Consumers are asking for fewer unknowns on labels, and manufacturers are responding by shifting toward identity-preserved sourcing, third-party certification, and traceability-first supply chains . The result is steady market expansion—especially where product positioning hinges on clean-label narratives and non-bioengineered ingredient expectations.\nAt the same time, scalability is moderated by higher sourcing costs, certification overheads, and uneven supply-chain infrastructure in regions where GMO cultivation dominates. Major suppliers are responding by expanding non-GMO and organic lines, upgrading processing capabilities, and investing in verification programs that keep trust high in retail and institutional channels.\n\nWhy the Market is Growing\nGrowth in the Non-GMO Oil Market is being supported by:\nRising consumer preference for clean labels, plant-derived oils, and sustainable agricultural practices\nIncreasing use of non-GMO oils in processed foods, bakery, infant nutrition, and nutraceutical blends\nGrowing skepticism or intolerance toward GMOs among key consumer groups\nRetail shelf expansion through non-GMO-certified assortments and transparency-led merchandising\n\nStory Continues\nWhat's holding the market back\nHigher raw material sourcing costs for certified non-GMO feedstock\nCertification and compliance overheads\nLimited non-GMO infrastructure in regions where GMO cultivation is dominant\nSemi-Annual Outlook: Growth Pace Gradually Strengthens\nFMI's semi-annual view signals a market that's finding its footing and accelerating modestly over time:\n\nH1 (2024–2034): 2.2% CAGR\nH2 (2024–2034): 2.9% CAGR\nH1 (2025–2035): 3.2% CAGR\nH2 (2025–2035): 3.9% CAGR\nThis pattern suggests improving demand realization as clean-label procurement expands and retail/private label strategies mature.\nSegment Spotlight\n1) Product Leadership: Soybean Oil Leads (34.7% Share in 2025)\nSoybean oil is expected to remain the leading non-GMO oil in 2025 due to affordability and established supply chains . While soybean anchors volume today, the market is also expected to diversify, with sunflower, safflower, and canola oils gaining momentum through 2035 as specialty nutrition and clean-label formulation needs broaden.\n2) Specialized Nutrition: Infant Nutrition (~12.6% Share in 2025)\nInfant nutrition is projected to account for 12.6% of global demand in 2025, reflecting rising emphasis on clean-label, allergen-safe, non-GMO-certified ingredients in early-life products. Non-GMO oils such as high-oleic sunflower, canola, and soybean are being used in formulas, cereals, and toddler nutrition—supported by heightened scrutiny of GMO content in pediatric nutrition and identity-preserved sourcing programs.\n\n3) Retail Acceleration: Private Label (~17.3% Share in 2025)\nPrivate label is estimated at 17.3% share in 2025 as retailers expand affordable, non-GMO oil lines under store brands. Retailers are leveraging third-party assurance (including Non-GMO Project Verified references in the market narrative), plus modern labeling tools such as QR-based transparency, to build trust and maintain price competitiveness. Packaging upgrades (e.g., glass bottles), cold-pressed variants, and sustainability storytelling are strengthening private label positioning.\nTrends Shaping Demand\nClean-label expectations are pulling non-GMO oils into mainstream shopping baskets, particularly among health-conscious consumers\nPlant-based eating patterns are supporting higher usage of non-GMO plant oils (including canola and olive) across home cooking and packaged foods\nSustainability and ethical sourcing are influencing brand choice, pushing suppliers toward responsible procurement and transparent supply chains\nE-commerce and direct-to-consumer models are expanding as consumers seek brand transparency and health-led positioning\nCountry Growth Outlook (CAGR) | 2025–2035\nCountry\nCAGR (2025–2035)\nIndia\n6.6 %\nJapan\n5.5 %\nChina\n4.5 %\nGermany\n3.2 %\nUSA\n2.6 %\n\nUSA: Demand is supported by health-conscious consumption and rising preference for organic/non-GMO options, with growing availability across supermarkets, health stores, and e-commerce.\nGermany: Strong consumer awareness of labeling and sourcing is reinforcing demand for certified organic and non-GMO oils through both retail and online channels.\nIndia: Expanding awareness of nutrition and clean-label foods is accelerating adoption, with broader access through modern retail and e-commerce platforms.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe market remains competitive as large ingredient and agrifood players scale non-GMO and organic verticals while regional suppliers build niche trust around sustainability and ethical sourcing. Leading players are focusing on processing upgrades, certification programs, and sourcing strategies that ensure identity preservation and consistent supply.\nCompanies referenced in the competitive set include:\nCargill Inc.; Archer Daniels Midland Company; Hain Celestial Group Inc.; Spectrum Organics; Centra Foods; Bunge North America; Adams Group; Jedwards International; La Tourangelle Inc.; Hojiblanca SCA.\nFor an in-depth analysis of evolving formulation trends and to access the complete strategic outlook for 2036, visit the official report page at: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-oil-market\n\nRelated Reports:\nNon-GMO Verified Sports Drink Market: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-verified-sports-drinks-market\nNon-GMO yogurt Market: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-yogurt-market\nNon GMO Food Products Market: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-food-products-market\nNon-GMO Soya Market: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-soya-market\nAbout Future Market Insights (FMI)\nFuture Market Insights (FMI) is a leading provider of market intelligence and consulting services, serving clients in over 150 countries.

Increasingly, counterparties are assessing what that authorization actually permits and whether it aligns with the firm's real operational model.\nBanks, payment institutions, and liquidity providers now routinely examine license scope during onboarding and ongoing reviews. Where permissions appear broad or undefined, compliance teams often request clarification or additional documentation. These reviews do not necessarily imply misconduct; rather, they reflect a growing preference for operational clarity before commercial integration.\n\nThis shift mirrors a broader evolution in financial risk management. Historically, jurisdictional reputation carried significant weight. Today, institutions more often focus on functional alignment - whether a firm's brokerage, dealing, custody, or payment activities correspond to the category of authorization it presents.\nIn response, a number of licensing frameworks internationally have adopted activity-specific classifications. Instead of general approvals, these structures distinguish operational roles such as agency brokerage, principal dealing, custody, or payment facilitation. The purpose is not to harmonize regulation globally, but to allow counterparties to evaluate exposure using consistent criteria.\nSome frameworks publish explanatory guidance describing how each category maps to actual operational conduct. Others maintain verification interfaces where third parties can independently confirm status and permitted scope. For compliance teams, such documentation reduces reliance on marketing descriptions and allows standardized review procedures.\n\nObservers note that interpretive risk - uncertainty about what a firm is authorized to do - has become a primary source of onboarding delay. Even well-established companies may face extended reviews if their authorization does not clearly match their business model. Conversely, clearly scoped permissions often allow faster internal assessment because the counterparty can categorize the relationship more easily.\nWithin this broader trend, certain licensing bodies - including the Neves Licensing Authority - publish categorized permissions and public verification references intended to help external institutions understand the nature of authorized activities before engagement. Market participants typically treat such information as contextual documentation rather than endorsement, using it to support internal risk classification processes.\n\nStory Continues\nPublic verification mechanisms themselves have become an important part of modern financial infrastructure. Accessible registers enable institutions to independently confirm both status and operational category, reducing dependence on self-reported information and improving consistency across cross-border relationships.\n\nThe emphasis on explainability reflects how financial credibility is evolving. Instead of asking only whether a firm is licensed, counterparties increasingly ask whether the authorization meaningfully corresponds to the firm's activities.\nAs international market participation continues to grow, this distinction - authorization versus operational alignment - is becoming central to due diligence. For many institutions, the ability to quickly determine what a firm is permitted to do is now as important as confirming that permission exists at all.\nMedia Contact:\nWebsite: https://neveslicensingauthority.org/\nEmail: info@neveslicensingauthority.org\nSOURCE: Neves Licensing Authority\n\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

According to the latest strategic outlook by Future Market Insights (FMI) , the global Oats Market -valued at USD 11.2 billion in 2026 -is on a clear trajectory to hit USD 16.8 billion by 2036 , expanding at a steady 4.1% CAGR .\n\nThe report highlights a fundamental pivot: oats are no longer viewed as a simple bulk commodity. Instead, they have become a mission-critical ingredient for health, sustainability, and the burgeoning plant-based dairy ecosystem.\nThe Evolution from Commodity to \"Interactive Wellness\"\nA key driver of this decade-long growth is the shift from price-focused generic supply to value-added, health-aligned formats. FMI's analysis indicates that while pre-2026 markets focused on basic yields, the 2026-2036 period is defined by precision agriculture and AI-assisted breeding for specific functional traits.\n\"The value proposition of oats has evolved,\" notes a senior market strategist. \"We are seeing oats transition into an interactive wellness ingredient. From digitally connected packaging providing personalized meal plans to 'Oat Milk 2.0' formulations focused on barista-grade performance without additives, the grain is now at the heart of the clean-label movement.\"\nSegment Insights: The Dominance of Rolled Oats and Food Processing\nRolled Oats (43.8% Share): Remain the industry's primary workhorse.

As food manufacturers and retailers intensify their focus on traceable, non-GMO-certified inputs, demand is rising across processed food, bakery, infant nutrition, and nutraceutical formulations—particularly where clean-label claims influence purchase behavior and labeling risk.\nMarket Snapshot: Non-GMO Oil Demand (2025–2035)\nNon-GMO oil market size (2025): USD 1,437.7 million\nNon-GMO oil market size (2035): USD 1,998.4 million\nForecast CAGR (2025–2035): 3.9%\nLeading segment (2025): Soybean oil (34.7% share)\nKey growth regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific\nHigh-potential demand pockets (named): Processed food, bakery, infant nutrition, nutraceuticals\nRetail dynamic (2025): Private label (~17.3% share)\nSpecialized nutrition dynamic (2025): Infant nutrition (~12.6% share)\nKey companies (named): Cargill Inc.; Archer Daniels Midland Company; Hain Celestial Group Inc.; Spectrum Organics; Centra Foods\n\nGet Access Report Sample: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-10963\nMarket Momentum: \"Non-GMO\" Moves from Niche Label to Procurement Standard\nNon-GMO oils are gaining traction because they reduce friction for brands operating in a world of ingredient scrutiny. Consumers are asking for fewer unknowns on labels, and manufacturers are responding by shifting toward identity-preserved sourcing, third-party certification, and traceability-first supply chains . The result is steady market expansion—especially where product positioning hinges on clean-label narratives and non-bioengineered ingredient expectations.\nAt the same time, scalability is moderated by higher sourcing costs, certification overheads, and uneven supply-chain infrastructure in regions where GMO cultivation dominates. Major suppliers are responding by expanding non-GMO and organic lines, upgrading processing capabilities, and investing in verification programs that keep trust high in retail and institutional channels.\n\nWhy the Market is Growing\nGrowth in the Non-GMO Oil Market is being supported by:\nRising consumer preference for clean labels, plant-derived oils, and sustainable agricultural practices\nIncreasing use of non-GMO oils in processed foods, bakery, infant nutrition, and nutraceutical blends\nGrowing skepticism or intolerance toward GMOs among key consumer groups\nRetail shelf expansion through non-GMO-certified assortments and transparency-led merchandising\n\n繼續閱讀\nWhat's holding the market back\nHigher raw material sourcing costs for certified non-GMO feedstock\nCertification and compliance overheads\nLimited non-GMO infrastructure in regions where GMO cultivation is dominant\nSemi-Annual Outlook: Growth Pace Gradually Strengthens\nFMI's semi-annual view signals a market that's finding its footing and accelerating modestly over time:\n\nH1 (2024–2034): 2.2% CAGR\nH2 (2024–2034): 2.9% CAGR\nH1 (2025–2035): 3.2% CAGR\nH2 (2025–2035): 3.9% CAGR\nThis pattern suggests improving demand realization as clean-label procurement expands and retail/private label strategies mature.\nSegment Spotlight\n1) Product Leadership: Soybean Oil Leads (34.7% Share in 2025)\nSoybean oil is expected to remain the leading non-GMO oil in 2025 due to affordability and established supply chains . While soybean anchors volume today, the market is also expected to diversify, with sunflower, safflower, and canola oils gaining momentum through 2035 as specialty nutrition and clean-label formulation needs broaden.\n2) Specialized Nutrition: Infant Nutrition (~12.6% Share in 2025)\nInfant nutrition is projected to account for 12.6% of global demand in 2025, reflecting rising emphasis on clean-label, allergen-safe, non-GMO-certified ingredients in early-life products. Non-GMO oils such as high-oleic sunflower, canola, and soybean are being used in formulas, cereals, and toddler nutrition—supported by heightened scrutiny of GMO content in pediatric nutrition and identity-preserved sourcing programs.\n\n3) Retail Acceleration: Private Label (~17.3% Share in 2025)\nPrivate label is estimated at 17.3% share in 2025 as retailers expand affordable, non-GMO oil lines under store brands. Retailers are leveraging third-party assurance (including Non-GMO Project Verified references in the market narrative), plus modern labeling tools such as QR-based transparency, to build trust and maintain price competitiveness. Packaging upgrades (e.g., glass bottles), cold-pressed variants, and sustainability storytelling are strengthening private label positioning.\nTrends Shaping Demand\nClean-label expectations are pulling non-GMO oils into mainstream shopping baskets, particularly among health-conscious consumers\nPlant-based eating patterns are supporting higher usage of non-GMO plant oils (including canola and olive) across home cooking and packaged foods\nSustainability and ethical sourcing are influencing brand choice, pushing suppliers toward responsible procurement and transparent supply chains\nE-commerce and direct-to-consumer models are expanding as consumers seek brand transparency and health-led positioning\nCountry Growth Outlook (CAGR) | 2025–2035\nCountry\nCAGR (2025–2035)\nIndia\n6.6 %\nJapan\n5.5 %\nChina\n4.5 %\nGermany\n3.2 %\nUSA\n2.6 %\n\nUSA: Demand is supported by health-conscious consumption and rising preference for organic/non-GMO options, with growing availability across supermarkets, health stores, and e-commerce.\nGermany: Strong consumer awareness of labeling and sourcing is reinforcing demand for certified organic and non-GMO oils through both retail and online channels.\nIndia: Expanding awareness of nutrition and clean-label foods is accelerating adoption, with broader access through modern retail and e-commerce platforms.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe market remains competitive as large ingredient and agrifood players scale non-GMO and organic verticals while regional suppliers build niche trust around sustainability and ethical sourcing. Leading players are focusing on processing upgrades, certification programs, and sourcing strategies that ensure identity preservation and consistent supply.\nCompanies referenced in the competitive set include:\nCargill Inc.; Archer Daniels Midland Company; Hain Celestial Group Inc.; Spectrum Organics; Centra Foods; Bunge North America; Adams Group; Jedwards International; La Tourangelle Inc.; Hojiblanca SCA.\nFor an in-depth analysis of evolving formulation trends and to access the complete strategic outlook for 2036, visit the official report page at: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-oil-market\n\nRelated Reports:\nNon-GMO Verified Sports Drink Market: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-verified-sports-drinks-market\nNon-GMO yogurt Market: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-yogurt-market\nNon GMO Food Products Market: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-food-products-market\nNon-GMO Soya Market: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/non-gmo-soya-market\nAbout Future Market Insights (FMI)\nFuture Market Insights (FMI) is a leading provider of market intelligence and consulting services, serving clients in over 150 countries.

Increasingly, counterparties are assessing what that authorization actually permits and whether it aligns with the firm's real operational model.\nBanks, payment institutions, and liquidity providers now routinely examine license scope during onboarding and ongoing reviews. Where permissions appear broad or undefined, compliance teams often request clarification or additional documentation. These reviews do not necessarily imply misconduct; rather, they reflect a growing preference for operational clarity before commercial integration.\n\nThis shift mirrors a broader evolution in financial risk management. Historically, jurisdictional reputation carried significant weight. Today, institutions more often focus on functional alignment - whether a firm's brokerage, dealing, custody, or payment activities correspond to the category of authorization it presents.\nIn response, a number of licensing frameworks internationally have adopted activity-specific classifications. Instead of general approvals, these structures distinguish operational roles such as agency brokerage, principal dealing, custody, or payment facilitation. The purpose is not to harmonize regulation globally, but to allow counterparties to evaluate exposure using consistent criteria.\nSome frameworks publish explanatory guidance describing how each category maps to actual operational conduct. Others maintain verification interfaces where third parties can independently confirm status and permitted scope. For compliance teams, such documentation reduces reliance on marketing descriptions and allows standardized review procedures.\n\nObservers note that interpretive risk - uncertainty about what a firm is authorized to do - has become a primary source of onboarding delay. Even well-established companies may face extended reviews if their authorization does not clearly match their business model. Conversely, clearly scoped permissions often allow faster internal assessment because the counterparty can categorize the relationship more easily.\nWithin this broader trend, certain licensing bodies - including the Neves Licensing Authority - publish categorized permissions and public verification references intended to help external institutions understand the nature of authorized activities before engagement. Market participants typically treat such information as contextual documentation rather than endorsement, using it to support internal risk classification processes.\n\nStory Continues\nPublic verification mechanisms themselves have become an important part of modern financial infrastructure. Accessible registers enable institutions to independently confirm both status and operational category, reducing dependence on self-reported information and improving consistency across cross-border relationships.\n\nThe emphasis on explainability reflects how financial credibility is evolving. Instead of asking only whether a firm is licensed, counterparties increasingly ask whether the authorization meaningfully corresponds to the firm's activities.\nAs international market participation continues to grow, this distinction - authorization versus operational alignment - is becoming central to due diligence. For many institutions, the ability to quickly determine what a firm is permitted to do is now as important as confirming that permission exists at all.\nMedia Contact:\nWebsite: https://neveslicensingauthority.org/\nEmail: info@neveslicensingauthority.org\nSOURCE: Neves Licensing Authority\n\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

According to the latest strategic outlook by Future Market Insights (FMI) , the global Oats Market -valued at USD 11.2 billion in 2026 -is on a clear trajectory to hit USD 16.8 billion by 2036 , expanding at a steady 4.1% CAGR .\n\nThe report highlights a fundamental pivot: oats are no longer viewed as a simple bulk commodity. Instead, they have become a mission-critical ingredient for health, sustainability, and the burgeoning plant-based dairy ecosystem.\nThe Evolution from Commodity to \"Interactive Wellness\"\nA key driver of this decade-long growth is the shift from price-focused generic supply to value-added, health-aligned formats. FMI's analysis indicates that while pre-2026 markets focused on basic yields, the 2026-2036 period is defined by precision agriculture and AI-assisted breeding for specific functional traits.\n\"The value proposition of oats has evolved,\" notes a senior market strategist. \"We are seeing oats transition into an interactive wellness ingredient. From digitally connected packaging providing personalized meal plans to 'Oat Milk 2.0' formulations focused on barista-grade performance without additives, the grain is now at the heart of the clean-label movement.\"\nSegment Insights: The Dominance of Rolled Oats and Food Processing\nRolled Oats (43.8% Share): Remain the industry's primary workhorse. Their dominance is anchored by their versatility in large-scale breakfast cereals, commercial baking, and ready-to-eat (RTE) snacks.\nSteel-Cut & Instant Variants: Steel-cut oats (28.4%) continue to support the premium and artisanal sectors, while Instant oats (19.2%) capture the \"convenience-first\" demographic.\nFood Processing (52.3% Application Share): This segment leads the market as manufacturers increasingly use oat-based platforms to enhance fiber and protein profiles in processed foods.\nDairy Alternatives: Oats have gained significant traction as the preferred base for milk alternatives, driven by their neutral flavor profile and superior sustainability credentials compared to other plant bases.\nRegional Performance: India and North America Lead the Curve\nWhile Europe maintains a high standard for organic and \"Bio\" oats, the most aggressive growth is occurring in urbanizing hubs and innovation-led markets:\n\nStory Continues\nIndia (6.2% CAGR): The global growth leader. India's surge is fueled by \"Desi-flavored\" savory instant oats and the rapid adoption of Westernized breakfast habits among urban professionals via quick-commerce platforms.\nUnited States (4.8% CAGR): A mature market revitalized by FDA-backed \"Heart Healthy\" labeling and the expansion of oat protein into frozen desserts and creamers.\nGermany (4.3% CAGR): Leads the \"Bio-Vegan\" standard, where oats are increasingly integrated into meat alternatives and gut-health mueslis.\nCanada (3.9% CAGR): Shifting from a raw grain exporter to a value-added powerhouse, investing heavily in domestic fractionation facilities for oat protein and fiber.\nKey Market Stats (2026)\nMetric\nValue / Metric\nCurrent Total Market Size\nUSD 11.2 Billion\nForecasted Size (2036)\nUSD 16.8 Billion\nRolled Oats Market Share\n43.8%\nFood Processing Application Share\n52.3%\nGrowth Leader\nIndia (6.2% CAGR)\n\nCompetitive Landscape: Consolidation and Functional Innovation\nThe competitive field is dominated by global specialists who are restructuring portfolios to prioritize \"gut-health\" and functional benefits.\nThe industry saw massive shifts in late 2025, including Mars, Incorporated's acquisition of Kellanova and The Ferrero Group's finalization of its deal for WK Kellogg Co.

It's a company worth only $3 million. Until recently, they made karaoke machines. They've since pivoted to create AI technology for the trucking industry. The company touted new tech in a release this week on how AI can help freight scaling, and it sparked a widespread sell off in some of the biggest trucking and logistics names. We've got other sectors that have also been vulnerable to this trend. Jared Blikre, our Markets and Data editor is with me here. And this to be\n00:26 Jared Blikre\nYes.\n00:27 Speaker A\nThis is emblematic of what we've been seeing recently. And it reminds me a lot, I brought this up earlier in the week, of Amazon at one time. Amazon would say, 'Oh, we're getting into the, you know, the doctor's business, you know, the doctor's office business.' and all of the stocks in that sector would go down. This is like that, but like supercharged, right? You get some tiny company that we used to be a karaoke company\n00:54 Jared Blikre\nThey're 6 million dollars now, but I mean peanuts.\n00:56 Speaker A\nRight, exactly. and somehow some algorithm picked up on that release, sent all these stocks down, then you get a pile on, but\n01:06 Jared Blikre\nit's been happening really across different industries over the past week. I think there's a general theme here and we'll get into that in a minute with that has to do with liquidity. But let's check out this is a this is the transports. This is the scene of the crime yesterday. I put rhyme in here because it's this little rectangle that you can't even see. But check out, I'm going to sort by performance here so you can see and Rhyme was up 12 and a half percent yesterday.\n01:31 Speaker A\nSo that's the company that we're talking about.\n01:32 Jared Blikre\nYes, Algorithm Holdings. Um, RXO, these are not household names, but RXO down 23%, CH Robinson 16, Landstar 15, Expeditors 15. These are logistics companies and so off that one little press release, huge, huge sell off and some of these companies just had their worst day ever. And transports by the way, had been leading this year. Let's check out the year to date real quick on this. You can see most of these stocks still in the green. There's XPO up 40%. But uh just goes to show you like you said, the market is on a hair trigger right now.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWell, and and that's what you were just saying about looking at the year versus today. That also speaks to what Amanda Agati was just talking about at PNC that the valuations are such that you also maybe are a little bit more vulnerable to these kinds of shocks. This whole thing started in software obviously, where there's a more obvious and direct link between AI threats and the business and then it's gotten more tenuous. Real estate. Sure. Why is an AI going to disrupt\n02:44 Jared Blikre\nExactly. I mean we what we work was not able to do, AI is just going to get it rolling again somehow. JLL down 18%. Honestly, I don't know a lot of these companies. I do know Newmark that was down 15%.\n02:58 Speaker A\nSo what set this off? Is there a uh specific threat?\n03:02 Jared Blikre\nI looked, I looked for the hair trigger and could not find one. Um for a lot of these, I think it's just the general idea and like you said, it's probably just an algo surfing the internet, looking for press releases, uh surfing the terminals and they find something, they latch onto it and because of these elevated valuations, I think that's an excellent observation. Well, then you get the sell up. Here is brokers and asset managers, Schwab down 10%, Robin Hood. That's a lot more volatile. You might expect that stock to be down 14% because it's day traded like the the like its users. LPL though down 14%, AMP down uh almost 14%, RJ uh Raymond James Financial down nine, so.\n03:48 Speaker A\nYeah. There was a company called Altruist that apparently came out and talked about a new AI tool yesterday. So asset managers also uh were getting hit by all of this. So we don't know what the pace of adoption of any of this new technology is going to be, how wide spread it's going to be, but it seems like\n04:09 Jared Blikre\njust a lot of unknowns and a lot of fear.\n04:11 Speaker A\nYeah, I have to say the other thing that got my attention this week, Jared, is there were some new articles, some new substacks about the threat that AI is going to be posing and that maybe we're underestimating it or maybe we're not addressing it in a policy way as properly. So I feel like when you get those vibes sort of underneath the surface, that can also affect potentially the the thinking of the market.\n04:41 Jared Blikre\nThis is what anxiety looks like in the stock market. Let's go to some of the winners though. Uh here's utilities and this has just have been a stalwart, kind of came back last year as part of the AI trade and could AI disrupt some of these guys? Probably, but a lot of them\n05:00 Speaker A\nBut AI needs this power.\n05:01 Jared Blikre\nExactly. So, you know, symbiotic relationship there. you going to bite the hand that feeds you? Well, leave it to AI. We'll figure that out later. But these aren't huge gains, but you can see amid a week where we're just looking at boards and boards of red, this was a bastion of strength. Another interesting one, agriculture. Big equipment, Caterpillar, one of the leaders in the Dow, if not the leader over the last year. That's going to be difficult to disintermediate, but uh we're seeing broad gains in this particular sector here.\n05:37 Speaker A\nAnd by the way, Cat's as much now related to that utility board as it is related to agriculture. They're building stuff for energy and power systems. That's\n05:50 Jared Blikre\nExactly. Here's one that uh just popped up on my radar, home builders. Okay. I mean, long-term interest rates are going down, maybe people are going to have a more affordable housing and maybe this is something that the projects are so long term that they can't really be disintermediated by AI. I, you know, we're just guessing here, but\n06:17 Speaker A\nYeah, I don't want to run out of time, Jared. So I want to make another point that uh is another chart that caught our eye and that was a chart looking at the last time we saw this many companies in the S&P 500 fall by as much as these companies that we've been looking at have been falling and what that indicates for the future, which is potentially not good.\n06:40 Jared Blikre\nYeah, this was potentially Exactly. This was a chart that came out from the compound. It's kind of wonky, uh but over the last eight days and this was posted yesterday, the number of companies that uh had 7% declines in one day and they charted this on a S&P 500 chart going all the way back to 2000. Usually this doesn't happen until we are deep into sell off territory or in the rebound phase. We are 2%, 3% from record highs in the S&P 500. This hasn't happened since the year 2000 and that's a very important analog because that was a .com boom. That was the top and uh I remember that time, we had tremendous liquidity in the market because back then there was a Y2K scare, you know, the rollover. So Greenspan flooded the market with liquidity and I think that kind of kept things alive, but the market was on a hair trigger because everybody realized that uh the .com boom had been overhyped and so it was time to call some of that in. I'm not saying it's the same thing happening here, but it's interesting that was the last time we saw this kind of price action in uh the S&P 500 stocks.\n07:54 Speaker A\nYeah, guys uh tweet at us if you're old enough to remember one thing. I haven't thought about that whole\n08:02 Jared Blikre\nI was writing\n08:02 Speaker A\nchange over in a while.\n08:03 Jared Blikre\nI was writing risk disclosure statement statements for companies filing with the SEC and we knew it was going to be nothing, but, you know, we had the money supply working for us.\n08:12 Speaker A\nYeah, there was still the worry about it. Jared, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\n08:15 Jared Blikre\nThank you.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

That juxtaposition, that polar opposite kind of friction that goes back and forth, is what I think makes people interesting, places interesting and fashion interesting. I agree with that. I think it all goes together,” he said.\n\nThese ideas were combined seamlessly in his fall collection, which was city chic and dramatic, without the fuss.\nKors said he’s always viewed his approach to design like a pantry, whipping up the essentials and spices in different ways. The fall lineup was a five-star dish filled with many exciting new ingredients.\nFor instance, Kors’ hallmark tailoring came with a new fluidity, as seen through a pair of gray trousers cut into a skirt with a dramatic train at its back, while one side of a tropical wool blazer was softened with an elongated bias panel and paired with his signature black turtleneck, which was actually a dickie, for “layering without the bulk,” he said.\nDaywear was extended with luxurious stovepipe trouser jeans, in cashmere and cotton; statement outerwear, like an exaggerated portrait-collared tailored topper, standout pea coats and furry stoles, slick leather gloves and architectural accessories that added oomph to his cozy knit dressing.\n\nAnd at Michael Kors, a “cocktail dress is not always a cocktail dress,” he said, so instead, supermodel Christy Turlington, who starred in Kors’ first campaign, closed his show in a billowing, train-adorned black top that had the ease of a T-shirt with elegance for nights on the town, worn with microscopic paillette-adorned silk georgette trousers. There also was a beautiful hand-embroidered, full 3D floral skirt in pink and red shades alongside paillette- and feather-adorned coats and fresh tops.\n\nStory Continues\n“In an urban situation where we do live in gray, black, neutral, those shades of red and pink and wine just sum up the perfect exclamation point,” Kors said of his Irving Penn-inspired palette.\n“There are times, though, when only a gown will do,” he quipped of striking monochrome black and red gowns with microscopic, hand-cut 3D floral embellishments. The looks were topped with built-in stoles — perfect for his woman ready to make her glamorous, head-turning entrance.\nLaunch Gallery: Michael Kors Collection Fall 2026 Ready-to-Wear Collection\nBest of WWD\nWindowsen RTW Spring 2022\nLouis Shengtao Chen RTW Spring 2022\nVegan Fashion Week Returns to L.A.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nIn HelloNation, Real Estate Expert Daniel K Whited of Myrtle Beach, SC, Shares Why Pre-Qualification Helps Coastal Home Buyers\n\nPR Newswire\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:13 AM PST 3 min read\n\nMYRTLE BEACH, S.C. , Feb. 13, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- How does pre-qualification help buyers succeed in the competitive market for coastal homes? That's the focus of a HelloNation article featuring insights from Daniel K Whited of Bowline Homes in Myrtle Beach, SC. The article explains why pre-qualification is more than a formality; it's a strategic move that helps buyers act quickly, confidently, and competitively when purchasing near the coast.\nThe article outlines how coastal homes are in high demand, attracting full-time residents, investors, and second-home seekers. In such a fast-moving environment, financial readiness can make or break a deal. Pre-qualification helps buyers clarify their mortgage eligibility, which gives them a stronger position when making offers. Without this step, potential buyers risk delays or missed opportunities when competing in a tight housing market.\n\nOne key point emphasized is the value of understanding affordability. Pre-qualification helps buyers determine a realistic price range based on their income, debt, and credit profile. Since coastal homes typically have higher price tags, buyers can't afford to make assumptions about what they can purchase. The article explains how pre-qualification prevents wasted time on properties beyond budget and helps streamline the home buying process by focusing attention on what's financially viable.\nThe article also highlights that in a competitive market, speed is essential. Pre-qualification signals to sellers that a buyer is serious and ready to move forward. That kind of financial readiness can give buyers an edge, especially when multiple offers come in soon after a listing goes live. With pre-qualification in hand, buyers can make quick, informed decisions, which is often a deciding factor in securing a home near the coast.\n\nIn addition to preparing for offers, the article explains how pre-qualification helps buyers uncover potential financial barriers early. Reviewing credit scores, income levels, and debt ratios with a lender can reveal opportunities to improve borrowing power before house hunting begins. The article notes that buyers of coastal homes should also factor in additional costs such as property taxes and insurance, and pre-qualification ensures those are included in the overall budget assessment.\nNegotiation strength is another benefit discussed. Sellers are more likely to view offers backed by pre-qualification or pre-approval as credible and serious. This can make a difference in negotiations, especially in a market where quick closing timelines or flexible terms can win a deal. The article makes clear that demonstrating financial readiness not only boosts buyer confidence but also improves the chance of success in a competitive market.\n\nStory Continues\nThe article also clarifies the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval. While pre-approval involves deeper financial verification, pre-qualification is faster and helps establish a starting point for mortgage planning. In high-demand markets, beginning with pre-qualification gives buyers a head start. It's often the first step in building a strong foundation for the full home buying journey.\n\nPeace of mind is another important outcome of pre-qualification. Knowing in advance how much a lender is willing to offer reduces stress and uncertainty. It allows buyers to focus on finding the right property, knowing they're in a position to act. In markets like Myrtle Beach, where coastal homes can sell quickly, that level of confidence is a key advantage.\nWhy Pre-Qualification Matters for Coastal Home Buyers features insights from Daniel K Whited, Real Estate Expert of Myrtle Beach, SC, in HelloNation.\nAbout HelloNation\nHelloNation is a premier media platform that connects readers with trusted professionals and businesses across various industries.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nStory Continues\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target. The company's AI application-specific integrated circuits exposure does not warrant a premium multiple versus market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA) , the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of TSMC (TSM) with a Buy rating and $450 price target.

      "Content": "Pinterest downgraded, Airbnb upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe Fly\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:49 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nAVGO\n\nPINS\n\nRIVN\n\nROKU\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nStory Continues\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target.

      "Content": "Rivian surges over 20% on delivery guidance, R2 launch in Q2; CEO says 'key inflection' reached The EV maker also posted a gross profit for Q4, driven by its software and services unit.\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:39 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nALI=F\n\nRivian ( RIVN ) stock surged on Friday morning after the EV-maker reported strong delivery guidance for the year, as it ramps up for the release of its R2 vehicle which the company said is on track for the second quarter of this year.\nThe company expects vehicle deliveries for 2026 in a range of 62,000 to 67,000 units, meeting Wall Street estimates of around 63,400 units and suggesting the upcoming R2 will boost sales.\nCrucially, the company said its upcoming R2 midsize vehicle is targeting customer deliveries for the second quarter, after early manufacturing validation builds rolled off the assembly line in January.\nRivian stock surged over 20% in early trade on Friday.\n\n\"This is for us a really key inflection here, where we're going to demonstrate the long term profitability of the business with R2, such an important program for us in terms of adding scale to business,\" CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nThat being said, Rivian sees its adjusted EBITDA loss for 2026 in a range of $1.80 billion to $2.10 billion versus a loss of $1.8 billion expected, with capital expenditures of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, meeting estimates of $2.05 billion.\n\n\"RIVN provided solid FY26 delivery guidance while providing EBITDA targets below the Street expectations as the company ramps its new and existing vehicle lines to generate stable revenue growth while investing strategically across the business,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients.\nAnd for a second quarter in a row, the company posted a gross profit of $120 million, broken down between a loss of $59 million for the automotive segment and a $179 million gain from software and services. Rivian said the jump in software and services profit is due to \"vehicle architecture and software development services\" stemming from its joint venture with Volkswagen ( VOW3.DE ).\nFor the year, Rivian's adjusted EBITDA loss came in at $2.063 billion, wider than estimates of $1.8 billion but within the company's forecast. Capital expenditures for the year hit $1.710 billion, versus estimates of $2.05 billion.\nCash and cash equivalents tallied $6.082 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, around $1 billion less than last quarter. Rivian said it had $6.588 million in total liquidity — crucial as it ramps up R2 production.\n\"We will be opportunistic with regards to additional capital raises,\" Scaringe said, adding that Rivian anticipates another $2 billion in cash and debt from its joint venture with Volkswagen this year.\n\nStory Continues\nRivian's big R2's ramp up is not without risks, however.\n\"The biggest risk in our ramp up, and what we've experienced in the past, and built some skills around managing, is just the complexities of ramping a supply chain, some of the unknowns within the supply chain, and that can be as specific as memory or chip set, or it could be as broad as aluminum supply,\" Scaringe said.\n\nFor the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.286 billion versus $1.26 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, down around 27% from a year ago. Rivian attributed the revenue declines to the loss of regulatory emissions credit sales, the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, and lower average selling prices.\nThe company posted an adjusted loss per share of $0.59 versus $0.69 expected, with an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss of $465 million versus $568.2 million expected.\nLast month, Rivian said it produced 10,974 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Ill., and delivered 9,745 vehicles in Q4, with full-year tallies of 42,284 vehicles produced and 42,247 vehicles delivered, reaching the midpoint of its guidance range of 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles delivered. However, Rivian’s original 2025 delivery target was between 46,000 and 51,000.\n\nAs part of the R2 product initiative, the company plans to amp up its AI and tech development, which investors are keen to hear more about.\nLast December, the company said software advancements from its new Autonomy platform and Large Driving Model (LDM), an autonomous model trained similarly to a large language model (LLM), will expand its Universal Hands-Free assisted driving to second-gen R1 vehicles, covering 3.5 million miles in the US.\nLater this year, a point-to-point hands-free system will be released, followed by a hands-free and eyes-free self-driving product, with the ultimate goal of achieving \"personal Level 4\" autonomy, meaning the vehicle will be able to drive fully on its own without requiring the driver's attention.",

Active investors can potentially outperform the market by selecting specific, high-performing securities and holding them.\n\nLet's look at three monster artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy and hold for the next three years.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need.

With the data center building boom, demand for networking equipment is red hot. And its opportunity with ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) is even bigger.\nThe company should be a big winner from Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) huge AI infrastructure spending surge, because Broadcom helps the leader in artificial intelligence make the tensor processing units (TPUs) that power its AI workloads. Meanwhile, Alphabet is beginning to let customers use TPUs for their own workloads through Google Cloud, and Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion order.\n\nOther hyperscalers are also turning to Broadcom to help them design their own custom chips, opening up an enormous growth opportunity over the next few years.\nAlphabet Alphabet is becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI. Its core Google Search revenue has accelerated with the introduction of new AI features, and its Gemini AI model has been recognized as among the best. Meanwhile, its cloud computing unit has been on fire, with revenue surging 48% last quarter.\nThe company plans to spend big on AI infrastructure this year to capture the opportunity it is seeing. This is a good move, since its TPUs give it a big structural cost advantage over competitors, at less than half the price of Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe company's decision to start letting customers deploy these chips within Google Cloud opens up another big revenue driver, with Morgan Stanley estimating that Alphabet has generated $13 billion in revenue for every 500,000 TPUs deployed. As the company with the most complete AI stack -- from its own custom chips to a leading AI model -- Alphabet is a stock to own for the next few years and beyond.\nMicron Technology One of the biggest bottlenecks in building AI infrastructure right now is memory. AI chips need to be packaged with high bandwidth memory (HBM) to optimize their performance, but the process to make HBM is complex and requires upward of three times the wafer capacity of ordinary DRAM (dynamic random-access memory). This has left the entire DRAM market in short supply and is leading to surging prices.\n\nStory Continues\nAs one of the three big DRAM makers -- along with South Korean companies SK Hynix and Samsung -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one of the best ways to play this dynamic. The current environment is leading to surging sales and huge gross margin increases.\nAnd with demand increasing rapidly, the current supply/demand situation for DRAM is likely to remain very tight over the next few years, despite Micron and others increasing capacity.

      "Content": "Why Did Rigetti Computing Stock Plunge This Week?\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:31 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: RGTI\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nThe shine has come off some quantum computing stocks after a rush to own a piece of the potential game-changing technology last year. Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) was one of the quantum darlings, but shares are now about 75% off their highs from last fall.\nThe plunge continued this week, with Rigetti shares down 15.4% as of Friday morning, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence .\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nWall Street's thumbs down This week's drop came after reports that TD Cowen analyst Krish Sinkar downgraded Rigetti stock. Sinkar thinks investors have gotten ahead of themselves with Rigetti. He also believes forward estimates for 2027 are too aggressive.\nThat's mainly because revenue potential could be lower than many believe. Rigetti reported only $1.9 million in third-quarter revenue, while investors are valuing the company at a market cap of nearly $5 billion. That's down from over $18 billion last fall, but it's still lofty given the fundamentals.\n\nRigetti management even believes most demand, and therefore value, for quantum computing will materialize after 2030. Rigetti stock is starting to reflect the view that returns could still be years away. Quantum computing may ultimately give businesses, governments, and universities a much more powerful platform. But investors likely will have plenty of time to pick winners and losers in the coming years. Rigetti stock is now declining from the overexuberance seen last year.\nShould you buy stock in Rigetti Computing right now? Before you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "US Adds Alibaba, BYD to List of Firms Aiding China’s Military\n\nMichael Shepard\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:09 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BABA\n\nBIDU\n\nBYDDF\n\nRBSTF\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon added Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc. and BYD Co. to a list of companies that aid the Chinese military, a move that amounts to a US government warning for investors even though it carries no direct legal repercussions.\nThe high-profile inclusions risk straining President Donald Trump’s visit to China that’s set for April, especially given Alibaba’s prominence. Trump’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing is expected to include discussion about plans to export Nvidia Corp.’s H200 chips to China, and Alibaba is among the companies that could seek to get them.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMamdani’s Grocery Plan Takes Shape In Economic Policy Shift\nThe Best Tactics for Tackling Speeders\nNY Private School Startup Seeks Edge by Giving 42% Fee Discount\nNew York Faces Slippery Evening Commute as Storm Moves in Fast\nNew Zealand Net Migration Sinks to Lowest Level in More Than a Decade\nThe list also included RoboSense Technology Co. and wireless router maker TP-Link Technologies Co.\nAlibaba’s American depositary receipts shares fell as much as 5% in extended trading on Friday. Inclusion on the list could amount to a serious challenge for Alibaba, which is stepping up efforts to compete globally in artificial intelligence.\n“There’s no basis to conclude that Alibaba should be placed on the Section 1260H List,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy. We will take all available legal action against attempts to misrepresent our company.”\n\nBaidu’s receipts were down 4.5%. Spokespeople for Baidu didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular office hours.\nThe list, first published in 2021, now includes more than 130 entities accused of working with the Chinese military. The names include those of airlines, construction companies, shipping companies, computer hardware manufacturers and communications companies.\nDeputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg had indicated in October that Alibaba, BYD, Robosense and other companies would be added to the list when he sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Bloomberg reported at the time.\nAn analysis by the law firm of Hogan and Lovells said inclusion on the 1260H List has “several direct and indirect implications,” including restrictions on US defense contracts, potential inclusion on other restricted party lists, reputational damage and increased compliance costs.\n--With assistance from Edwin Chan and Debby Wu.\n\nStory Continues\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUPS’s Missteps Have Made the Company’s Road Ahead Less Certain\nDrug Cartels Are Shifting Their Money Laundering to Crypto.

      "Content": "1 Growth Stock Down 32% to Buy Hand Over Fist in February, According to Wall Street\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: DDOG\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) developed an industry-leading cloud observability platform, which alerts businesses to technical issues with their digital infrastructure and sales channels before customers are negatively impacted.\nDatadog is now using its expertise in this field to help businesses deploy artificial intelligence (AI) software as effectively as possible. The products it has launched in this space so far are attracting significant demand, and it has even more in the pipeline. In fact, the company just reported its full-year operating results for 2025, and its revenue growth accelerated, partly thanks to its AI products.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nDatadog stock is trading almost 37% below its November 2025 record high, but Wall Street thinks this might be an opportunity. The majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given the stock a buy rating, and their consensus price target points to significant potential returns. Here's why their bullishness might be justified.\nDatadog's AI products are seeing significant demand In mid-2024, Datadog launched a product called LLM Observability, which helps developers track costs, uncover technical issues, and monitor the quality of the outputs of their large language models (LLMs). These models sit at the foundation of customer-facing AI software, so it is critical that they maintain the highest standard of quality.\nBut not every business has the financial or technical resources to build an LLM from scratch, so some of them adopt models from third-party developers like OpenAI as a shortcut. Datadog looks after these customers with a product called OpenAI Monitoring, which allows businesses to keep track of their usage, costs, response times, and error rates.\n\nBut Datadog isn't stopping there. It's gearing up to launch a series of new observability tools to track the usage and performance of AI agents and coding assistants, which could be extremely popular as more businesses and developers lean on these technologies to help improve their productivity.\nDatadog said 5,500 of its 32,700 customers were using at least one of its AI products at the end of 2025, which was up by a whopping 57% from the year-ago period. The company also said its Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which is the bridge between Datadog observability data and customer AI models and software, saw a staggering 11-fold increase in requests compared to the third quarter just three months earlier. In simpler terms, usage of Datadog's AI integrations is exploding.\n\nStory Continues\nRevenue growth accelerated in 2025 Datadog generated $3.43 billion in total revenue during 2025, which was a 28% increase from the year before. It marked an acceleration from the 26% growth the company produced in 2024, and a lot of this momentum is attributable to AI customers.\nDuring the fourth quarter, for example, Datadog's revenue grew by 29% overall, but by 23% if you exclude AI-native customers (these are AI-first companies like OpenAI and Anthropic). That means this very small cohort of just 650 customers accounted for six percentage points of Datadog's total revenue growth for the period -- and this doesn't include the thousands of other customers that are also using the company's various AI tools.\n\nDatadog also had another strong year at the bottom line, bringing in $363.4 million in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income. That was up only marginally compared to 2024, mainly because the company spent aggressively in areas like research and development throughout the year to expand its AI product portfolio.\nWall Street is bullish on Datadog stock The Wall Street Journal tracks 48 analysts who cover Datadog stock, and 36 of them have given it a buy rating. Eight others are in the overweight (bullish) camp, while three recommend holding, and just one recommends selling.\nThe analysts have an average share price target of $185.92, implying Datadog stock could climb by 47% over the next 12 to 18 months. However, the Street-high target of $260 suggests the stock could more than double instead.\nI think those targets are achievable if Datadog's revenue growth continues to accelerate, especially because its stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.7, which is near the cheapest valuation since it went public in 2019.\nLast year, Datadog valued its addressable market in the observability segment alone at $52 billion, and it expects that figure to grow by 9% per year through 2029. Based on the company's current revenue, it has barely scratched the surface of that opportunity. But remember, Datadog will soon launch entirely new products in this space for AI agents and coding assistants, which could expand the size of its observability opportunity even further than expected.\n\nAs a result, I think Wall Street analysts are right to be bullish on Datadog stock, especially at its current price.\nShould you buy stock in Datadog right now?

      "Content": "Will Data Center Unit Help NVIDIA Reach Its $65B Q4 Revenue Goal?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 25, and it would be no surprise if the company reaches another sales milestone and surpasses the $65 billion target. NVDA has been setting new sales records for the past few quarters. In the last reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, its revenues reached a new record of $57.01 billion, reflecting a 62% year-over-year increase.\n\nNVIDIA is optimistic that the growth momentum will continue as it again targets record revenues of $65 billion in the fourth quarter. The key driver behind this outlook is its booming data center business, which continues to power the company’s growth amid the global buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the data center business unit reported $51.22 billion in revenues, up 66% from last year.\nThe segment reached new highs as demand for accelerated computing, generative AI, and large-scale model training continued to rise across cloud providers and enterprise customers. Much of the momentum came from the rapid adoption of the GB300 platform and wider deployment of NVIDIA’s networking products, including NVLink and Spectrum-X. With hyperscalers racing to expand AI capacity, NVIDIA remained a key beneficiary of record spending on high-performance infrastructure.\n\nThe near-term outlook still appears solid, with the company expecting further strength from Blackwell shipments and expanding orders across cloud, sovereign AI and enterprise AI projects. NVIDIA also sees the growing adoption of agentic AI, long-context workloads and advanced inference systems, all of which depend on high-performance graphics processing unit clusters, as key catalysts for long-term growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the data center segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $58.72 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 65%.\nThe growing demand for the company’s AI chips used in data centers is likely to continue aiding its overall top-line performance. Analysts’ projections also suggest that the company is expected to surpass the fourth-quarter sales target of $65 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $65.56 billion, calling for a year-over-year surge of 66.7%.\n\nNVIDIA’s Competitors in the AI Data Center Space Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC are two major companies that are competing closely with NVIDIA in the AI data center space.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is gaining traction with its MI300 series accelerators, which are designed to handle training and inference for large AI models. AMD’s chips have attracted interest from major cloud providers seeking diversification beyond NVIDIA’s ecosystem. While Advanced Micro Devices’ software stack is still developing, its performance and pricing advantages make it a credible alternative.\n\nStory Continues\nIntel is also reasserting its presence with the Gaudi series of AI accelerators. The company is positioning Gaudi3 as a cost-effective and scalable option for AI data centers, targeting enterprise clients looking for flexibility. Intel’s broad reach in CPUs and server infrastructure helps it integrate AI solutions more easily into existing systems.\n\nNVIDIA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 34.6% over the past year compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s gain of 36%.\nNVIDIA One-Year Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, NVDA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.36, below the industry’s average of 28.62.\nNVIDIA Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies a year-over-year increase of approximately 55.9% and 57%, respectively. Estimates for fiscal 2026 have remained unchanged at $4.66 per share in the past 60 days. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2027 have been revised upward by 2 cents to $7.32 per share in the past 30 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After opening strongly on Thursday, stocks immediately rolled over. By the first hour mark, they were down sharply, and although stocks didn't close at the lows, they remained down for the rest of the session. With a variety of issues weighing on stocks and a big rotation out of technology after three years of double-digit gains, we could be setting up for a sizable correction. Losses were steep across the board Thursday, with the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, closing down 2.04% at 22,597. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at 6,832, down 1.57%, and the Dow Jones Industrials were last at 49,451, down 1.34%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was also down more than 2% to 2,615.\n\nTreasury Bonds: Yields plummeted across the Treasury yield curve as investors ran for the safety and security of guaranteed U.S. government paper. The rally was fueled by weak economic data, including rising jobless claims and declining job openings, which increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. However, with the solid jobs numbers earlier in the week, and if todays consumer price index numbers come in higher than expected all bets are likely off. The 30 year long bond closed at 4.74%, while the ten year nore closed at 4.10%.\n\nOil and Gas: Oil and energy stocks have made a strong start in the first six weeks of 2026, but were hammered on Thursday after the International Energy Agency cut its 2026 demand growth outlook. With a sector already worried about oversupply, that was all it took to bring in the sellers. Brent Crude closed Thursday at $67.65, down 2.52%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the day at $62.98, down 2.55%. Natural gas was the lone winner in the sector, rising 1.87% to close at $3.21.\n\nGold: After a stunning bounce back from the recent flash-crash, gold took a solid hit on Thursday with the rest of the market. The bullion finished the day down 3.19% at $4,920. Falling below the $ 5,000-per-ounce level, which has been considered near-term support, was driven primarily by strong U.S. labor market data. This data reduced expectations for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and triggered a cascade of selling pressure as investors cut losses. As mentioned, if the CPI data comes in below expectations you can expect more buying. Silver also closed lower Thursday down a massive 10.65% at $75.19.\n\nStory Continues\nCrypto: The Crypto markets saw heavier selling on Thursday, with Bitcoin entering a deep rout and crypto-related stocks posting sharp declines following a prolonged, multi-month selloff. Sentiment for crypto currencies as a whole continue to be downbeat, with trading volumes slowing during the fourth-quarter 2025 selloff that has extended into February. At 8 AM EST Bitcoin is trading at $67,042, while Ethereum is quoted at $1,958.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.\n\nHere are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Friday, February 13, 2026.\nUpgrades: Airbnb Inc.

Here’s what you should know .\nWhy Micron Is Moving Higher Analyst Joseph Moore pointed to continued DRAM price strength and persistent supply shortages as the main reasons behind the improved outlook, Investing.com reported.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nBefore the IPO: How One Company Quietly Locked Up 500+ Iconic Character Rights\nMorgan Stanley noted that mainstream DRAM prices could double again and still remain more than 10% below current spot levels, which continue to trend upward. Contract pricing has already climbed 86% since December, and the firm says buyers who waited too long to secure inventory are now paying close to high teens ASP per GB.\n\nWhat Else Is Driving Sentiment? Micron is also preparing to announce a new investment in memory‑chip manufacturing capacity in Singapore, focused on NAND flash production, signaling that the company expects long‑term demand to remain strong, according to the report.\nSee Also: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\nWhat Do Other Analysts Think About Micron? Micron Technology has recently received favorable ratings from several analysts, with most maintaining an optimistic outlook. Similarly to Morgan Stanley’s rating, Mizuho kept its Outperform rating, increasing the target from $390 to $480 on Jan. 27.\nOther significant rating actions include William Blair initiating coverage with an Outperform rating on Jan. 22. In addition, TD Cowen and Stifel both maintained their Buy ratings on Jan. 20. TD Cowen set a new target of $450, up from $300, while Stifel raised its target from $300 to $360.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% annually, a notable drop from the previous month and a return to levels seen before the 2025 tariff implementation. Both the headline and core inflation rates matched or beat economist forecasts, with the monthly all-items index rising a modest 0.2%.\n\nIn yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major indices ended in the red. The Magnificent Seven stocks fell, with Apple (AAPL) sliding -5% and Tesla (TSLA) dropping more than -2%. Also, trucking and logistics stocks sank amid concerns about disruption from AI, with Landstar Systems (LSTR) tumbling over -15% and C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) slumping more than -14%. In addition, Cisco Systems (CSCO) plunged over -12% and was the top percentage loser on the Dow after the networking company reported weaker-than-expected FQ2 adjusted gross margin and issued tepid FQ3 adjusted gross margin guidance. On the bullish side, Equinix (EQIX) surged over +10% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after the data-center real estate investment trust issued strong FY26 guidance.\n\nMore News from Barchart 4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n“AI might be boosting the economy thanks to massive capex investments and productivity enhancements, but it’s becoming a net negative for the stock market,” said Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli.\n\nThe Labor Department’s report on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week fell by -5K to 227K, compared with the 222K expected. Also, U.S. existing home sales fell -8.4% m/m to a 16-month low of 3.91 million in January, weaker than expectations of 4.16 million.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran said on Thursday that the central bank’s current monetary policy stance risks undermining U.S. economic growth that is otherwise being “underwritten” by a slew of Trump administration policies, including tax cuts. “The biggest risk I think to the economy is that we’re misconstruing just how tight monetary policy is,” Miran said.\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times reported on Friday that President Trump plans to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum products.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the earnings front, notable companies such as Moderna (MRNA) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) are set to release their quarterly results today.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.118%, up +0.34%.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.09% this morning as investors digest fresh corporate earnings reports and a raft of economic data from the region, while also awaiting the key U.S. inflation print. Consumer stocks underperformed on Friday, with L’Oreal (OR.FP) falling over -3% after the cosmetics giant reported weaker-than-expected Q4 sales growth. Mining stocks also lost ground. Limiting losses, defense stocks climbed, led by a more than +7% gain in Safran (SAF.FP) after it projected higher revenue and earnings for 2026 and raised its 2028 targets. Also, technology stocks advanced, although the sector remained among the week’s underperformers. The benchmark index is on track to end the week little changed. Eurostat said in an update on Friday that the Eurozone’s gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter stood at 0.3%, in line with a preliminary estimate. Separately, final data from the INE showed that Spain’s annual inflation rate eased more than expected in January. In addition, data showed that the European Union’s exports to the U.S. remained resilient last year despite the higher tariffs imposed by President Trump. Investors now turn their attention to key U.S. inflation data. In other corporate news, Delivery Hero Se (DHER.D.DX) fell over -6% after the food-delivery company’s Middle East unit reported mixed results.\n\nSpain’s CPI, Eurozone’s GDP (second estimate), Eurozone’s Employment Change (preliminary), and Eurozone’s Trade Balance data were released today.\nThe Spanish January CPI fell -0.4% m/m and rose +2.3% y/y, compared to expectations of -0.4% m/m and +2.4% y/y.\nEurozone’s GDP came in at +0.3% q/q and +1.3% y/y in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations.\nEurozone’s Employment Change arrived at +0.2% q/q and +0.7% y/y in the fourth quarter, stronger than expectations of +0.1% q/q and +0.6% y/y.\nEurozone’s December Trade Balance stood at 12.6 billion euros, stronger than expectations of 11.8 billion euros.\nAsian stock markets today closed in the red. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -1.26%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.21%.\n\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index closed lower today as investors pared risk ahead of a week-long holiday. China’s onshore stock markets will be closed from February 15-23 for the Lunar New Year holiday and will reopen on Tuesday, February 24th. Topsperity Securities said in a report that trading volumes typically ease ahead of the Spring Festival holiday, but China’s stock market has remained “at a relatively high level” without retreating, concluding that a firmer yuan provided support. Technology stocks fell on Friday, tracking losses in their global peers. Energy and mining stocks also slid. At the same time, consumer-related stocks climbed as investors wagered they would likely benefit from holiday spending. The benchmark index notched a modest weekly gain. Meanwhile, there were signs of improvement in Sino-U.S. relations after Reuters reported that the Trump administration shelved several key tech security measures aimed at Beijing ahead of an April meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. On the economic front, data showed that China’s new home prices continued to fall in January, keeping pressure on cash-strapped developers and the broader economy. In corporate news, Bank of East Asia plunged over -11% in Hong Kong after the bank reported a drop in full-year net profit.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed lower today, retreating from a record high as sentiment soured after AI-related concerns sparked a selloff on Wall Street overnight. Technology stocks were among the biggest losers on Friday, with SoftBank Group sliding over -8% even as the technology investor posted a fourth straight quarterly profit. Shigetoshi Kamada, an advisor at the research department at Tachibana Securities, said, “There was little positive surprise from the results, so SoftBank shares fell along with the market move.” Energy, real estate, and industrial stocks also slumped. Despite Friday’s drop, the benchmark index posted strong gains for the week, marking its second consecutive weekly advance. Goldman Sachs strategists upgraded Japanese stocks to Overweight on Friday, citing expectations for “a period of political stability” and policy tailwinds for “defense, critical resources, shipbuilding, power resources, U.S. re-industrialization plays.” Meanwhile, Bank of Japan policy board member Naoki Tamura on Friday raised the possibility that the central bank could soon declare that its price target has been achieved. “It is quite possible that, as early as this spring, the price stability target of 2% can be judged to have been achieved,” Tamura said, highlighting his preference for a near-term rate hike. In other news, foreign investors bought a net 543.2 billion yen ($3.55 billion) worth of Japanese stocks in the week ended February 7th in anticipation of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s decisive election win, marking a seventh consecutive week of inflows, according to Ministry of Finance data. In other corporate news, Inpex plunged over -13% after the country’s largest oil and gas producer flagged a 16% drop in its full-year net profit for the year to December. At the same time, Kioxia climbed more than +7% after providing upbeat full-year earnings guidance. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +0.32% to 34.21.\n\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nMost chip stocks are moving lower in pre-market trading, with Micron Technology (MU) and Intel (INTC) falling more than -1%.\nU.S. steel stocks slid in pre-market trading after the Financial Times reported that President Trump plans to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum products.

      "Content": "AMD Taps Ariel Kelman To Sharpen AI And Data Center Story\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NasdaqGS:AMD) has appointed Ariel Kelman as Chief Marketing Officer.\nThe leadership change comes as AMD increases its focus on AI and data center products.\nKelman brings experience from major technology firms to sharpen AMD's global marketing efforts.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:AMD, this move comes at a time when the stock has delivered strong longer term returns, with a 1 year return of 84.2% and a 3 year return of 157.2%. The current share price of $205.94 places the company in the spotlight, as it competes for enterprise and AI workloads where clear product positioning can influence large customer decisions.\nKelman's appointment indicates that AMD is putting more emphasis on how it presents its AI and data center strategy to customers, partners and the broader market. As the company refines its offerings in these areas, investors may pay close attention to how effectively AMD communicates its product roadmap and value proposition relative to well funded competitors.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Advanced Micro Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Advanced Micro Devices.\nDoes the team leading Advanced Micro Devices have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\nKelman’s arrival comes just days after AMD reported record Q4 2025 revenue of US$10.27b and net income of US$1.51b, with data center and AI products sitting at the center of the story. As AMD pushes to position itself as a credible alternative to Nvidia and Broadcom in AI infrastructure, the way it tells that story to cloud providers, enterprises and developers starts to matter almost as much as the silicon itself. Kelman’s background at Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Oracle is closely aligned with the customer set AMD is targeting, especially hyperscalers and large software vendors that buy at rack scale and care about full platform offerings rather than just chips. Reporting into Ruth Cotter and working closely with the wider executive team, he will shape brand, go to market and developer engagement at a time when AMD is guiding to Q1 2026 revenue of about US$9.8b and is rolling out new accelerator and server CPU generations. For you as an investor, this leadership change is less about a sudden shift in strategy and more about execution quality on AI and data center growth plans that are already in motion.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Advanced Micro Devices Narrative Kelman’s enterprise focused background supports the existing narrative that AMD is leaning into long term AI and data center demand, especially with large cloud and sovereign projects that value consistent messaging and ecosystem building.\nAt the same time, his appointment highlights execution risk that the narrative already flags, since winning share from Nvidia, Intel and custom in house chips depends not just on products but on how effectively AMD convinces hyperscalers and governments to commit to multi year deals.\nThe narrative focuses heavily on product roadmaps and long term revenue assumptions, but it does not fully account for how a revamped marketing engine could influence developer adoption, software ecosystem depth and customer mix over the next few years.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Advanced Micro Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Higher marketing and ecosystem spending, on top of already elevated AI related operating expenses, could weigh on near term margins if revenue growth from data center and AI deals does not keep pace.\n⚠️ Analysts have flagged customer concentration and inventory risks around AI hardware, and a stronger push into large accounts under Kelman increases exposure if a few big customers delay or scale back spending.\n🎁 A CMO with deep experience at Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Oracle could help AMD sharpen its pitch to enterprise buyers and developers, supporting the company’s aim to grow AI and data center revenue over time.\n🎁 Better alignment between product, marketing and developer relations may help AMD differentiate its accelerators and EPYC server chips versus Nvidia and Broadcom, supporting efforts to win rack scale and platform deals.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on whether AMD’s marketing shift shows up in concrete ways, such as deeper partnerships with major cloud providers, clearer software and developer tool messaging around its Instinct accelerators, and more consistent positioning of EPYC based platforms against Nvidia and custom chips. Commentary on earnings calls around customer engagement, funnel visibility and AI deal quality will be useful signals for how effectively Kelman and the broader team are executing. You can also track whether higher operating expenses tied to AI and marketing are matched by sustained progress in data center revenue and any changes in analyst sentiment on execution risk.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Advanced Micro Devices, head to the community page for Advanced Micro Devices to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst NVIDIA, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Alibaba Group Holding\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 12:46 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nBABAF\n\nNVDA\n\nBABA\n\nINTC\n\nFor Immediate Releases Chicago, IL &ndash; February 13, 2026 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Intel Corp. INTC, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA.\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Bitcoin vs. NVIDIA: Digital Gold or AI Giant for Long-Term Growth? For long-term investors, Bitcoin (BTC) remains a highly speculative and volatile asset facing significant selling pressure. In contrast, NVIDIA Corp. stands out as a stronger long-term investment thanks to its solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects. Here&rsquo;s why &ndash;\nBitcoin Sinks as Crypto Winter Deepens Bitcoin&rsquo;s price has been declining steadily for some time, ushering in what many are calling a crypto winter. After reaching an all-time high of $127,000 in October last year, the digital asset dropped below $90,000 in December and then slipped under $80,000 in January. Following its most recent slide, Bitcoin is now down 22.9% year to date, trading around $67,000.\nSo, what triggered the downfall? Obviously, Bitcoin entered a correction after record highs, as selling pressure intensified and profit-taking weighed on the price. At the same time, institutional participation declined as interest in the so-called digital gold cooled, contributing to broader pessimism across the crypto market. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw an outflow of $3 billion in January this year, following withdrawals of $7 billion in November and $2 billion in December last year.\n\nGeopolitical tensions also pushed investors toward safe havens like gold and silver, while demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies softened, as they are generally viewed as riskier investments. Overall, sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, remains weak, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index firmly in the &ldquo;extreme fear&rdquo; territory.\nNVIDIA Rides AI Boom as Revenues Soar on Easing Trade Woes NVIDIA is undoubtedly encountering stiff competition from rivals like Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . as data center capital expenditure increases. Nevertheless, driven by the rapid rise of AI, NVIDIA continues to deliver impressive quarterly results. This sustained performance is largely due to the incessant demand for its cutting-edge chips, especially the latest Blackwell architecture, as well as the ever-increasing need for cloud-based graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA expects global data center spending to reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion annually by 2030, creating a significant opportunity for the company to expand sales of its computing hardware. U.S.-China trade complications have also settled somewhat, which is a positive development for NVIDIA. Chinese officials have approved the sale of H200 AI chips to select customers, including ByteDance and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The Trump administration has already granted approval for these chips to be shipped to China.\n\nNVIDIA now anticipates fiscal fourth-quarter 2026 revenues of nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the company&rsquo;s revenues surged 62% year over year and 22% quarter over quarter to $57 billion.\nBitcoin or NVIDIA: Which Is the Better Long-Term Bet? After its peak, Bitcoin&rsquo;s downfall has been fueled by profit-taking, reduced institutional interest, rising geopolitical tensions that pushed investors toward safer assets, and overall weak sentiment across the crypto market. For now, the market appears to be waiting for fresh catalysts to resume Bitcoin&rsquo;s momentum. However, one thing is clear: it is a highly speculative asset, and it faces massive selling pressure during periods of negative investor sentiment, making it less suitable for a long-term investment.\n\nOn the other hand, NVIDIA is a proven stock that has delivered consistent returns despite geopolitical challenges and intense competition. NVIDIA remains strongly positioned for future growth fueled by rising demand for its chips and a continued increase in data center spending. NVIDIA&rsquo;s net profit margin of 53% exceeds the industry's average of 50.1%, underscoring its strong growth and making it an attractive long-term buy (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\nNVIDIA, currently, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

      "Content": "鉅亨投資雷達》勞退自提6%值得嗎？還是自己投資比較好？ 鉅亨買基金\n2026年2月12日 週四 下午10:56\n\n「我自己投資台股、美股，長期報酬不是更高嗎？」「而且勞退要等到退休才能領，資金完全被鎖住。」這是多數上班族面對勞退自提 6% 時的第一個疑問。勞退自提 6% 到底是不是一個「一定要做」的選擇？還是其實只適合某些人？\n1. 勞退基金是什麼？自提 6% 是什麼意思？\n依《勞工退休金條例》規定，雇主每月必須為勞工提繳薪資 6%，存入個人退休專戶，由勞動部勞動基金運用局統一管理，屬於個人帳戶制，就算公司倒閉也不影響這筆資金，離職後也仍會持續累積。 在雇主提繳之外，勞工可再自願提繳 1%～6% 的薪資，這就是所謂的「勞退自提」。自提金額不計入當年度薪資所得課稅，即稅前扣除，並設有最低收益保障機制，保證比定存好， 但資金須等符合法定退休條件後才能動用，且投資標的由政府統一運作。因此，自提 6% 的本質，是一種結合稅務優惠與強制儲蓄機制的退休準備工具。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n2. 什麼時候可以領？怎麼領？\n\n請領退休金課稅方式\n年滿 60 歲即可請領。年資不同，能選的領法不同：提繳年資滿 15 年以上：可選月領或一次領；未滿 15 年：原則一次領。\n「一次領」與「分期領（月領）」的差別在課稅方式不同。簡單說， 一次領是用「年資」去算免稅門檻，領越多、超過門檻的部分才會被計入所得；分期領則是每年先扣一個固定免稅額，超過的部分才算所得。\n舉例來說，假設工作 30 年退休，並選擇一次領取。免稅額度 = 19.8 萬 x 30 年 = 594 萬元。只要領取的退休金總額沒超過 594 萬元，就不須繳稅；若超過則按照級距有半額課稅或全額課稅的差別。如果選擇每月請領，免稅額度是看全年的請領總額，若不超過 85.9 萬元，則免課稅，一般來說這是不容易達到的課稅門檻。若好奇以目前薪資做自提，在退休後可以領到多少金額可以到 勞動部 網站做試算。\n3. 自提 6% vs 自己投資差在哪？\n我們直接用 2004 年至 2024 年的歷史實際資料來回測。假設每月投資 6,000 元，持續 20 年，分成兩種情境比較：第一種是每月把 6,000 元全額自提進勞退帳戶；第二種是不自提，而是把每月 6,000 元扣除當年度所得稅後的實際可投資金額，定期定額分別投資於台股、美股與美國科技股。\n從結果來看，成長型市場在這 20 年間確實累積出明顯優勢。即使在 40% 高稅率下，美國科技股約 833 萬元，仍高於勞退的 361 萬元，顯示報酬率對最終成果的影響相當關鍵。不過，隨著稅率提高，差距會逐步縮小。以台股為例，5% 稅率下最終約 738 萬元，但 40% 稅率時降至 466 萬元，與勞退 361 萬元的距離明顯拉近。 原因在於稅率越高，稅後可投入的本金越少，自提「完整投入」的優勢便開始浮現。因此，成長型資產決定長期累積速度，而稅率高低則影響起跑點。當稅率達 20% 以上時，自提的節稅優勢逐漸明顯化。\n不過，必須注意股票有崩盤並賠掉本金的風險，而勞退基金依法有「保證收益機制」 ，政府承諾就算勞退基金操盤賠得亂七八糟，最後結算給你的收益，絕對不會低於銀行定存利率。換句話說，這是一筆保證不賠本的投資。\n勞退自提與扣除稅率後投入股市的累積金額相比\n4. 我適合自提 6% 嗎？\n在討論自提之前，更重要的其實是檢視自己的理財習慣。如果單純追求長期報酬最大化，不自提、將扣稅後的資金持續投入高成長股市，理論上確實可能累積出更高的金額。但這個前提包含幾個條件：你能選到合適的標的、未來市場能延續過去的成長趨勢，以及你能在市場波動甚至大幅下跌時，仍然堅持定期定額、不恐慌贖回。此外，還有一個更現實的問題：每個月薪水發下來後，這筆原本打算投資的錢，是否真的會被確實投入，而不是被日常開銷慢慢侵蝕？\n如果你是一位具備良好投資紀律 、能長期執行計畫且能承受波動的投資人， 自行投資確實更具潛在成長空間 。但 如果對自己的執行力沒有那麼有把握 ，或擔心情緒影響決策，那麼 勞退自提的價值就在於把紀律制度化 。薪資尚未入帳即完成提撥，既節稅又強制儲蓄，讓退休準備成為一個穩定、持續的過程。\n再進一步來看， 如果你的適用稅率達 20% 以上 時，自提屬於稅前扣除，節稅效果會隨稅率提高而放大，對高稅率族群而言， 自提的優勢更加明顯 ；若 稅率較低，則節稅效益有限，建議優先建立緊急預備金與基本投資配置 ，再評估是否提高自提比例。\n鉅亨投資策略\n該不該自提 6%？依稅率與紀律做出適合的選擇\n若單純追求長期報酬最大化，自行投資高成長市場通常更具優勢；但若考量稅務效率、強制儲蓄與資產穩定性，自提 6% 仍有其制度價值。第一，先檢視自己的稅率與現金流狀況。第二，評估自身是否具備長期投資紀律與風險承受能力。第三，將自提視為退休配置的一部分，而非全部。成熟的退休規劃，不是二選一，而是在成長與穩定之間取得平衡。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nA20106\n富邦 NASDAQ-100 指數基金 (本基金之配息來源可能為本金及收益平準金)\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導",

      "Content": "鉅亨雙週報》AI股震盪、利率預期翻轉與日英政治巨浪 鉅亨買基金\n2026年2月12日 週四 下午10:55\n\nBTC-USD\n\n67,694.59 ( 0.69% )\n\n這兩週市場同時遭受 AI 海嘯、利率轉向與政治黑天鵝接連衝擊。美國聯準會立場轉鷹，川普提名前理事華許接掌聯準會主席，加上英國工黨面臨執政危機，以及日本高市早苗政府在大選勝出後，形同獲得一張擴張財政與強硬外交的空白支票。同時，從比特幣到白銀都在上演高台跳水，投資人忽然想起本益比三個字。當股匯債與原物料同步劇烈波動，這波震盪到底是短期情緒，還是新一輪景氣與政策循環的序曲？\n1. 利率與聯準會市場從等降息變成別作夢\n廣告\n廣告\n\n鮑爾在一月會議後明確表示經濟明顯改善且就業穩健，等於把上半年降息空間先行封鎖，聯邦基金期貨也乖乖把降息預期往後延。川普拋出凱文華許作為新任聯準會主席提名人選，市場開始重新計算未來利率路徑與美元走勢。降息不再是何時開始，而是會不會比想像中更少。在這種情況下，高估值科技股首當其衝，標普五百與那斯達克連日回檔。避險情緒升高卻無處躲避，連黃金都被追繳保證金的賣壓波及，提醒投資人利率週期尚未轉向。\n\n2. AI 熱潮與科技股從萬能解答變成估值殺手\nAI 依舊是故事主角，但這回是以反派姿態上場。Anthropic 推出新工具後，市場開始認真計算如果 AI 能寫程式、審合約與處理資料，那些靠人力與訂閱服務生存的軟體公司，未來利潤如何支撐股價？結果美國軟體股單日蒸發 2,850 億美元市值。另一邊 SpaceX 收購 xAI，Meta 與甲骨文大舉投入重金建置 AI 基礎設施，說明資本支出仍在加碼，但股價卻因利率與估值承壓。簡單說 AI 長期前景亮眼，短期卻淪為回檔藉口，尤其是漲多的美股科技龍頭。\n3. 地緣政治與政策英日劇烈轉向、川習再度交鋒\n政治局勢完全沒有平息跡象。英國工黨幕僚長請辭，首相史塔默的人事與外交任命陷入風暴，執政穩定性遭質疑，英鎊與英國資產面臨折價風險。相反地日本眾議院選舉讓高市早苗大勝，市場解讀為日本將大開財政大門。擴張財政、國防支出與更鷹派的外交路線，對日股與日債殖利率都是強烈訊號。川普與習近平通話再度把焦點拉回貿易與台海，從大豆、石油到軍事溝通，全都牽動資金對台灣與中國資產的風險溢酬定價。中東方面，美伊在阿曼預備重啟核談，若有進展，能源供給風險可望緩和，但在那之前，油價仍對任何飛彈或談判破局高度敏感。\n4. 資產波動加密貨幣、高貴金屬與飆過頭的銅\n在利率高檔震盪與 AI 泡沫疑慮雙重壓力下，風險資產首先重挫。比特幣單日重挫約一成，白銀一度暴跌兩成，黃金也被拖下水，說明這一輪不是避險買盤，而是去槓桿化。同時前一波在中國投機資金推升下大漲的銅價，也被重新檢驗基本面。中國製造業 PMI 再度掉回預警區間，地方財政與信用風險消息不斷，讓中國需求復甦這個論點顯得底氣不足。相較之下，台灣因 AI 供應鏈帶動，上調成長預測。美日股也在震盪中維持中長期成長趨勢。市場開始用更苛刻但理性的眼光，選擇繼續追求成長或先保留現金。\n鉅亨投資策略\n在震盪中聚焦核心資產，避免盲目進場\n在利率延長賽與 AI 估值修正下，美股、日股與台股因經濟與產業結構具備成長動能，中長期持續看好，但短期需接受劇烈波動，特別是高本益比科技股的修正過程。大宗商品方面，貴金屬與工業金屬近期價格大起大落，既反映槓桿去化，也暴露出市場對全球需求的疑慮，配置上建議相對保守，以避險與分散投資為主，而非短線追價。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nB15112\n富蘭克林坦伯頓 - 日本\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導",

      "Content": "AMD Just Announced a Huge Turnaround. Is It a Buy?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nAMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has been a great stock to own since 2025. Its stock is up around 60% since then, outperforming Nvidia over the same time frame. Up until a few days ago, AMD's stock was up over 100% during the same time frame, but it cratered after the company's fourth-quarter earnings announcement.\n\nIf I presented you the numbers, you may question why the sell-off occurred in the first place, as it looks like AMD has started the turnaround it told investors about months ago. Is this your buying opportunity? Or should you stay patient for a deeper decline?\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAMD's data center sales are accelerating One thing that has held AMD back during the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race is its lack of focus on AI. Unlike Nvidia, which gets around 90% of its revenue from data center sales, AMD is more evenly spread out. During Q4 2025, 52% of sales came from data center revenue, while 38% came from its client and gaming division, and another 9% came from its embedded process division (totals don't add up to 100% due to rounding errors). Because AMD isn't as leveraged to data center sales, it isn't participating as much during one of the biggest technological shifts we've ever seen with generative AI .\n\nHowever, AMD is starting to increase its data center growth rate.\nDuring Q4 2025, its data center revenue increased at a 39% year-over-year pace. That's solid acceleration from Q3 2025's 22% growth rate, and Q4 could be the quarter that we look back on as the turning point for AMD. However, this is a small growth rate compared to what management thinks it will get to. Furthermore, sales to China are starting to return now that the Trump administration is starting to allow exports there again. This will be a solid boost throughout 2026 and beyond.\nBack in November, AMD released five-year guidance regarding each of its business units. During that release, it told investors that they could expect a 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the data center division and a 10% CAGR for the other two. Combined, that would lead to a 35% CAGR companywide through 2030. While AMD fell slightly short of those projections during Q4, it still did an excellent job and is showing greater progress toward meeting those goals.\n\nBut why did AMD's stock slip?\nAMD's stock was expensive entering the quarter Before the sell-off, AMD's stock was trading for nearly 40 times forward earnings; now it trades for about 31.\n\nStory Continues\nConsidering AMD's track record and relative growth rate, there was no reason for AMD's stock to be valued that high, so a pullback was due. Furthermore, rival Nvidia trades for just 24 times forward earnings despite a greater market share and a stronger growth rate. So, to call AMD's stock cheap here is a fallacy, in my opinion.\n\nStill, I think it could deliver strong growth moving forward, especially if its data center division's revenue growth accelerates toward that 60% growth figure management guided for last year. For 2026, Wall Street analysts expect 34% revenue growth, and in 2027, that figure rises to 37%. Both of those are in line with the 35% overall CAGR management expects to deliver, so the analyst community believes that AMD can deliver on its promise.\nI'm still more bullish on Nvidia than I am AMD, but I think AMD is a worthy buy at this point in time as an alternative pick in the AI space. The AI build-out is far from over, and AMD could still deliver impressive growth despite missing out on the initial stages.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Deepens AI Inference Push With Groq Deal And Rubin Platform\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:13 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nSSNLF\n\nMU\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nNvidia agreed to acquire Groq's AI inference chip assets for $20b, aiming to expand its position in AI deployment hardware.\nThe company introduced its new Rubin chip platform, designed around next generation memory technology for inference workloads.\nSamsung and Micron are set to supply HBM4 memory for Nvidia's new GPU platforms, signaling changes in its component supply chain.\nRecent U.S. policy signals on legacy AI chip exports to China may affect how Nvidia serves that market.\n\nNVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) enters this phase of product and deal news with a share price of $186.94 and a one year return of 38.2%. Over the past week, the stock is up 8.8%, while the year to date return sits at a 1.0% decline, reflecting some recent volatility.\nFor you as an investor, the Groq acquisition and Rubin launch are mainly about where Nvidia wants to compete as AI usage shifts toward real world applications. Memory partnerships and evolving China export rules add extra moving parts that could influence demand, pricing power, and how its product roadmap plays out, all of which are worth watching alongside the share price.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for NVIDIA by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on NVIDIA.\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 4 things going right for NVIDIA that every investor should see.\nNvidia’s $20b move for Groq’s inference assets and the Rubin platform launch point to a clear push beyond training GPUs into AI-inference specific hardware. That fits with what you are seeing elsewhere in the business, from distributed inference trials with Prologis and EPRI at utility-adjacent micro data centers to heavier use of Nvidia’s Isaac and BioNeMo platforms in areas like warehouse autonomy and lab robotics. The announced use of Samsung and Micron HBM4 on upcoming GPUs ties Nvidia more tightly to key memory suppliers, which may help support Rubin and Vera Rubin ramps but could also concentrate supplier risk. On the policy side, signals that older Hopper-generation chips might see looser export treatment to China, while newer architectures stay tightly controlled, effectively segment Nvidia’s portfolio by region and performance tier. For you, the thread across these developments is that Nvidia is working to secure more of the inference stack, from edge sites to large AI factories, while juggling supply chain depth and export rules that can affect where and how quickly new products scale.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The NVIDIA Narrative The Groq acquisition, Rubin platform work and distributed inference partnerships support the narrative that Nvidia is leaning into an AI infrastructure supercycle that spans both training and inference across data centers and edge locations.\nGreater reliance on specific HBM4 suppliers and export segmentation between Blackwell or Rubin and older Hopper chips underscores narrative risks around supply chain fragility and geopolitical limits on total addressable market.\nThe focus on inference specific hardware and micro data centers, as well as physical AI in labs and factories, extends the story into use cases that are not fully captured by a training centric view of AI data center growth.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for NVIDIA to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Tighter links to a handful of HBM4 suppliers may expose Nvidia to component shortages or pricing pressure if memory capacity becomes constrained or terms change.\n⚠️ Export rules that keep the latest Blackwell and Rubin chips out of China could cap growth in that market and push some large customers toward domestic or alternative accelerators from peers like AMD or in house silicon.\n🎁 The Groq asset purchase and Rubin inference focus give Nvidia more product depth against inference competitors such as AMD and custom ASIC providers, which can help support its position across the AI stack.\n🎁 Memory partnerships with Samsung and Micron, plus work on distributed inference sites, can help Nvidia stay aligned with where AI workloads are heading, from large training clusters to latency sensitive edge deployments.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, it is worth watching how quickly Nvidia integrates Groq’s technology into shipping inference products and whether Rubin based systems gain traction with cloud providers and large enterprises. The terms and volumes associated with Samsung and Micron HBM4 supply will be important signals for how smoothly future GPU ramps can proceed. On the policy side, any concrete rules around legacy Hopper exports to China, compared with continuing restrictions on newer architectures, will help clarify how much of Nvidia’s portfolio can serve that market. Together, these factors will influence how balanced Nvidia’s AI exposure is between training and inference, and how diversified its demand and supply chains remain.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for NVIDIA, head to the community page for NVIDIA to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The S&P 500 is down 0.2% for the year, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 gauge has lost around 2%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMamdani’s Grocery Plan Takes Shape In Economic Policy Shift\nThe Best Tactics for Tackling Speeders\nNY Private School Startup Seeks Edge by Giving 42% Fee Discount\nNew York Faces Slippery Evening Commute as Storm Moves in Fast\nNJ Transit Service Between Trenton and New York City Resumes\nThe divergence underscores global funds’ shift of preference from AI pioneers burdened by massive spending toward hardware producers with strong pricing power, many of whom are in Asia. Surging memory chip prices have been a boon for the region’s heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co., while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s irreplaceable role as the world’s leading contract chipmaker has provided support for Taiwanese stocks.\n“The main worry of the US is hyperscaler spending money,” said Richard Tang, head of research Hong Kong at Julius Baer. “Most of Asia’s tech exposure is upstream. Whoever wins in the end, upstream will still collect revenue from downstream players.”\nThe heavy presence in Asia of advanced chip manufacturers, semiconductor foundries and assemblers, which are crucial to the AI infrastructure, is a key reason behind the region’s resilience during the recent rout on Wall Street. Micron Technology Inc.’s latest comments on memory chip supply tightness and Nvidia Corp.’s on sustainable spending have reinforced such a perception.\n\nIn a sign of growing foreign demand, Samsung Electronics saw its biggest overseas buying Thursday, sending its shares up 6.4%. They rose again on Friday. Meanwhile, global investors also notched their third-largest weekly purchase in Taiwanese stocks in a holiday-shortened week.\nKioxia Holdings Corp.’s shares surged 15% on Friday after soaring AI demand helped the Japanese memory chipmaker deliver a better-than-anticipated results outlook.\nThat’s as the Nasdaq 100 Index fell 4.6% and shed about $1.5 trillion in market value over the past 10 sessions, hit by a selloff in software names and other stocks deemed at risk from new AI tools.\n\nStory Continues\n“Some of the scares in the US are also good news in Asia, particularly when thinking about what infrastructure is really needed to harness agentic AI,” Stephanie Aliaga, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “What markets are really beginning to price in is this ChatGPT moment for AI agents.”\n\nMajor Asian chipmakers’ outsize weighting in local equities markets further amplifies their impact on stock moves.\nTSMC alone is approaching a weighting of 45% in the island’s benchmark Taiex index, three times its level a decade ago. South Korea’s Kospi has become a near duopoly, with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix Inc. together making up nearly 40%.\nWhile the so-called AI Scare Trade has also hurt US real estate services stocks and insurance brokers, there was less damage in Asia due to some of the local companies’ weaker response to cutting-edge technologies.\nThe Topix insurance sub-index has risen 6.2% since Feb. 3, with its real estate counterpart surging 15%.\n“Old school wins the day so far,” said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. “It’s protecting them from the AI disruption selloff because these industries are more entrenched in Japan and less open to disruption so far.”\nAs a result, the correlations between Asian and US equities based on weekly returns have slid to 0.43, the weakest level since June 2022, Bloomberg-compiled data show.\nTo be sure, Asia wasn’t entirely insulated from the global turmoil. Despite accounting for a small portion of the region’s stock markets, shares of software firms including Hong Kong-listed Kingdee International Software Group Co. and Indian tech services companies including Infosys Ltd. slumped along with their US peers during the recent sell-off.\n\nBut for now, Asian stocks are expected to continue their outperformance, thanks to the local companies’ different roles in the AI ecosystem, cheaper valuations and stronger earnings growth.\n“What we are investing in are the AI enablers such as chip manufacturers,” said Elfreda Jonker, client portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management. “One of our big positions is TSMC, which we continue to like. All AI roads lead to TSMC.”\n--With assistance from Masaki Kondo, Gabrielle Ng and Anthony Stephens.\n(Updates with Kioxia earnings in 7th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUPS’s Missteps Have Made the Company’s Road Ahead Less Certain\nDrug Cartels Are Shifting Their Money Laundering to Crypto.

Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\nRemitly PayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nStory Continues\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\nThe Trade Desk Finally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $492,937 !*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $52,460 !*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $429,385 !*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee the 3 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 9, 2026\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nGeoffrey Seiler\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:57 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure market is continuing to boom, and this is still a great place to look to invest. Let's look at two AI stocks that investors can buy now and hold for the next decade.\nundefined\nBroadcom One of the most exciting AI stocks to own right now for the long term is undoubtedly Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The AI infrastructure market is booming with no signs of let-up in sight. At the same time, data center networking is becoming more important as AI chip clusters grow, while there has also been a shift toward companies looking to create their own custom AI chips to save costs.\nAs the inference market eventually outpaces training over the coming decade, AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) should begin to take more share away from graphics processing units (GPUs ), which are currently the primary chips used to power AI workloads.\n\nThis is all great news for Broadcom. The company is a top player in data center networking, where its Tomahawk Ethernet switch is a leading solution within AI data centers. Meanwhile, the company helped Alphabet create its highly successful tensor processing units (TPUs), which look poised to become a huge growth driver as Alphabet aggressively builds out its AI infrastructure and starts letting customers use its chips for their AI workloads, as well. Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion TPU order to be delivered this year for use within Google Cloud. Meanwhile, other companies, including OpenAI, are also working with Broadcom to develop their own custom AI chips.\nBetween networking and custom AI chips, Broadcom has one of the biggest growth opportunities in the AI space over the next decade.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Another huge beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). The company is the leading manufacturer of chips in the world, and it has a near monopoly on making advanced chips. As competitors have struggled with achieving high yields for advanced chips, TSMC has become the go-to partner for chip designers and is working in lock step with them to increase capacity to meet surging demand. Best of all, it benefits from both GPU and AI ASIC growth.\nTSMC's position in the industry has also given it strong pricing power, which has helped it boost its gross margins. According to reports, it has already informed customers of a four-year price hike schedule. Between boosting its capacity and price increase, TSMC looks poised to be a long-term winner in the AI infrastructure space.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Morgan Stanley tweaks Micron stock price target as pressure builds\n\nMoz Farooque\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nSSNLF\n\nMicron ( MU ) stock just got another major nod of approval from Wall Street , and the timing is telling.\nShares of the popular memory maker are up 10% over the past week, and Morgan Stanley sees even more upside, raising its price target to $450 from $350 while reiterating an overweight rating.\nThe bullishness stems from the fact that memory pricing power continues to go from strength to strength.\n\nMicron and other memory makers have been on a killer run as AI infrastructure spending rises at an exponential pace. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) has become mission-critical for AI accelerators, and supply has struggled to keep pace.\nMicron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra discussed AI’s insatiable demand for memory during a recent CNBC interview at Davos.\nAnd AI’s relentless appetite for memory isn’t slowing down anytime soon, per Seeking Alpha and according to Samsung Electronics CTO Song Jai-hyuk .\nSpeaking at Semicon Korea 2026, he said that AI-linked infrastructure demand should remain strong through at least 2027, with the tech titan ramping up mass production of its sixth-generation HBM4 chips.\n“ Memory and packaging are no longer supporting roles ,” said Clark Tseng of Semi, a semiconductor research and analysis outfit. “They are now critical to how fast AI infrastructure can scale .”\n\nAdditionally, Lenovo said memory costs jumped 40% to 50% in the past quarter and could double in the current one.\nThat’s exactly the setup that’s pushing Micron stock to record highs, up 44% year to date , despite broader market sluggishness.\nThe ongoing AI infrastructure buildout is expanding rapidly, positioning Micron well for the remainder of the year.\nWhere Wall Street sees Micron stock heading next Micron is trading at $410.34 (as of Feb. 12, 2026).\nMorgan Stanley: $450 (+9.7%) UBS: $450 (+9.7%) Deutsche Bank: $500 (+21.9%) Wells Fargo: $410 (-0.1%) Citigroup: $385 (-6.2%)\nMorgan Stanley sees pricing power getting stronger, not weaker Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore is making the case that, despite the eye-opening run in DRAM over the past year, the cycle is only tightening.\n“As much as happened in the last 12 months in DRAM, we remain excited for what's ahead,” he wrote. The key element to consider at this point is supply, or rather, the lack of it.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nThe numbers back up the bullishness:\nDDR5 spot pricing up 30% YTD\nSpot prices are 130% above January contract levels (up 86% from December).\nMainstream pricing could double again while still sitting at more than 10% below spot.\nASPs could approach the high-teens per GB.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s tremendous pricing leverage.\nMoreover, Moore now expects Micron to earn as much as $52 per share in 2026 , speahreaded by HBM demand tied to Nvidia . “ HBM is certainly a key part of the story here ,” he noted, but added that DDR5 pricing alone is now “ a much more attractive market right now .”\nMicron is smaller in HBM, but the gap is narrowing AI accelerators have been gobbling up HBM, and businesses that can efficiently ship product at scale continue to win over investor confidence.\nAt this point, though, the scoreboard in the memory space is clear.\nIn DRAM, SK hynix leads the charge with 33.2% market share , followed by Samsung at 32.6% , with Micron at 25.7% .\nIn HBM, which is the critical part for AI GPUs, the gap is wider.\nRelated: Top analyst revamps Apple stock price target\nSK hynix currently dominates with a 53% market share , Samsung holds 35% , and Micron trails at 11% .\n\nIn NAND, Samsung leads at 32.3% , SK hynix follows at 19.3% .\nSo clearly, SK hynix is the stand-out company that’s dominating the HBM scene and will likely capture the bulk of Nvidia’s early Rubin volume. Also, Samsung is moving aggressively to ramp HBM4 shipments and close the gap.\nAt the same time, despite Micron being a much smaller player in HBM, it’s ramping HBM4 and benefiting from the broader memory crunch.\nIt’s important to note that Micron is already in high-volume production on HBM4, having sold out its 2026 supply.\nMicron stock crushes the S&P 500 across every major time frame YTD: Micron +43.77% versus S&P 500 +1.40%\n1-year: Micron +336.16% versus S&P 500 +14.38%\n3-year: Micron +585.96% versus S&P 500 +69.70%\n5-year: Micron +374.49% versus S&P 500 +77.24%\n10-year: Micron +4,134.67% versus S&P 500 +279.50%\nSource: Seeking Alpha\nRelated: JPMorgan doubles down on S&P 500 target for one key reason\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 12, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

At a time when investors have been stressed about the impact AI would have on competition, a less-than-impressive quarterly update from Cisco Systems, shares of which plummeted more than 12%, helped to sour the market on technology stocks broadly. Other sectors also got caught up in worries about AI disruption, says Brad Bernstein, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management. “I think what we're seeing today is more of what we've seen recently in the last week or two, that is a lot of volatility around the markets, shooting first, asking questions later on any news around AI disrupting any sector. And it's not just software that was a big cause recently of all the tech volatility. We are seeing it today show up in office commercial real estate. We saw it earlier this week in wealth management firms. So any news that may cause any disruptions in any sector is causing immediate sell-off, regardless of whether or not it actually will have any material impact in any of these companies that are selling off.” Shares of Applovin were the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 software index, tumbling more than 19%, despite beating market estimates for fourth-quarter sales. But investors worried about signs of increasing competition and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Shares of logistics companies CH Robinson and Landstar and Expeditors International both saw double-digit percentage declines after CNBC reported that a new tool from AI company Algorhythm Holdings made trucking companies the latest target of investor worries about AI disruption. But shares of Equinix rallied more than 10% after the largest data-center operator forecast annual revenue above estimates, betting on strong AI-linked demand. After the stronger-than-expected jobs report earlier this week, investors now look to the January Consumer Price Index for the latest inflation data. The report is due on Friday.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The estimated transaction value was $38.60 million based on the average closing price during the fourth quarter of 2025. At quarter-end, the position’s value increased by $46.78 million, a figure that reflects both trading and price appreciation effects.\nWhat Else to Know The fund increased its SKWD holding, bringing the position to 3.7% of 13F AUM as of December 31, 2025.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares were priced at $45.49, down 6.8% over the past year; one-year alpha versus the S&P 500 was (21.25) percentage points.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.34 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$141.20 million\nMarket Capitalization\n$2.06 billion\nPrice (as of market close 2026-02-10)\n$45.49\n\nCompany Snapshot Offers commercial property and casualty insurance products, including general liability, excess liability, professional liability, commercial auto, group accident and health, property, surety, and workers' compensation.\nGenerates revenue primarily through underwriting insurance policies and managing risk across specialized commercial lines.\nTargets businesses and organizations in the United States seeking tailored insurance solutions for complex or specialty risks.\nSkyward Specialty Insurance Group is a Houston-based insurance holding company with a focus on underwriting commercial property and casualty insurance across diverse specialty lines.

The shares were valued at more than $38 million.

Overall, shares have advanced by 211%, equal to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44.5%. Yet, over the last 12 months, shares are nearly unchanged, having declined by 4%. Moreover, shares within a whisper of their 52-week low of $42.45.\n\nThe stock has come under pressure as the commercial insurance market has entered a slump. Consequently, the stock has lost steam. In addition, some company insiders have engaged in stock sales — which can poison market sentiment and serve as a warning to retail investors.\nOn the other hand, some institutional investors (like Reinhart Partners) remain bullish on the stock.

However, the next phase of the AI race may not just be for a single winner. As demand shifts from GPUs to full-stack computing solutions such as CPUs, AI accelerators, and software ecosystems, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is emerging as a serious challenger.\n\nAMD entered 2025 with strong momentum and exited the year strengthening its case that it could be the next semiconductor winner. AMD stock has gained 85% in the past year, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX) gain of 15%. So far this year, AMD stock is down roughly 4%.\nMore News from Barchart 4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nLet's find out whether AMD stock is a good buy now on the dip.\nData Center and AI Represent AMD’s Growth Engine Valued at $348 billion, AMD designs high-performance processors and graphics chips used in data centers, personal computers, gaming consoles, and AI systems. In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 34% year-over-year (YOY) to $10.3 billion, driven by record sales of EPYC server processors, Ryzen CPUs, and Instinct accelerators. Diluted earnings rose 40% YOY to $1.53 per share. The data center segment became the company's key growth engine. Q4 data center revenue climbed 39% YOY to $5.4 billion, driven by robust EPYC server processor demand and accelerated MI350 series GPU shipments. The adoption of fifth-generation EPYC Turin CPUs surged, “accounting for more than half of the total server revenue,” while fourth-generation EPYC processors remained in high demand.\n\nNotably, hyperscaler demand remained high, with over 230 new AMD-powered instances launched throughout the quarter. Over the course of the year, hyperscalers added more than 500 AMD-based instances, bringing the overall number of EPYC cloud instances up by more than 50% to nearly 1,600. Looking ahead, AMD anticipates continued high server demand as hyperscalers increase infrastructure to support AI and enterprises modernize data centers for emerging AI workflows. Additionally, the ramp of MI350 series shipments and additional MI308 sales to customers in China contributed to the growth of the data center AI business.\nOn the software side, AMD expanded the ROCm ecosystem, allowing for speedier deployment and better performance across a wider range of workloads. Management noted that customer interest in AMD's next-generation MI400 series and Helios platform is growing. Last quarter, AMD announced a multi-generational partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs. The company believes the launch of MI400 and Helios represents a major inflection point and expects data center revenue to grow more than 60% annually over the next three to five years, with AI revenue scaling to tens of billions of dollars annually by 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking ahead, AMD is also developing the MI500 series using the cDNA6 architecture and advanced two-nanometer process technology with HBM4e memory. AMD plans to release MI500 in 2027, aiming for another significant boost in AI performance for next-generation multimodal models.\nAMD’s Other Segments Are Going Equally Strong AMD’s Client segment revenue rose 34% to a record $3.1 billion, driven by strong demand across multiple generations of Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. Meanwhile, Gaming revenue increased 50% YOY to $843 million, supported by strong demand for Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs and higher channel sellout during the holiday period. AMD also launched FSR4 Redstone, its latest AI-powered upscaling technology.\nThe Embedded segment's revenue increased 3% YOY to $950 million as demand strengthened in the test and measurement and aerospace markets. AMD closed $17 billion in embedded design wins in 2025, bringing the total since acquiring Xilinx to more than $50 billion. The firm ended the quarter with a sturdy balance sheet holding $10.6 billion in cash and equivalents.\n\nFor the full year, revenue grew 34% to $34.6 billion, with more than $7.6 billion added from data center and client revenue growth. Gross margin reached 52%, and EPS rose 26% YOY to $4.17, even as the company continued investing heavily in AI and data center initiatives.\n2026 and Beyond Could Be Exceptional AMD expects strong growth to continue into 2026, driven by increased adoption of EPYC CPUs, expanding Instinct deployments, continued client share gains, and a return to growth in embedded markets. For Q1 2026, the company expects revenue of around $9.8 billion (plus or minus $300 million), representing roughly 32% YOY growth at the midpoint.\nLooking further ahead, AMD sees revenue growth above a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three to five years, expanding operating margins, and annual EPS exceeding $20 within its strategic timeframe. Analysts forecast AMD’s earnings to increase by 60% in 2026, followed by another 58% in 2027. AMD stock is valued at 37.9 times forward earnings, compared to its historical average of 93 times.\n\nAMD’s expanding portfolio, from Helios AI infrastructure in the cloud to Ryzen processors powering edge and PC AI, positions the company to capture growth across the entire AI compute stack, making it a strong contender to Nvidia.\nIs AMD Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell Now? Overall, the consensus for AMD stock has changed from a “Moderate Buy” one month ago to a “Strong Buy” consensus now. Of the 45 analysts covering AMD, 31 rate it a “Strong Buy,” while two recommend a “Moderate Buy,” and 12 recommend a “Hold.” Based on the average price target of $288.54, analysts see potential upside of about 40% over the next 12 months. Furthermore, the high target of $380 implies a potential price increase of 84% from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in February\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 1:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been hit hard in recent weeks. The market is growing skeptical about AI spending, but the reality is that it's still going strong. We've received news of what capital expenditures look like for many of the AI hyperscalers during 2026, and these record-setting numbers indicate one thing: The AI buildout is far from over.\n\nThis makes me bullish on a specific group of stocks, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Both of these companies are poised to benefit from the massive amount of money being spent this year, and look like excellent buys right now as a result.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nHow much is being spent on AI? The three companies I want to focus on for capital expenditures spending amounts are Amazon , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms . All three of these companies are AI hyperscalers and are spending a ton on computing equipment for internal use and to rent out to customers via their cloud computing service.\nFor 2026, Amazon expects to spend $200 billion, Alphabet up to $185 billion, and Meta up to $135 billion. Combined, that's over $500 billion in capital expenditures. That's not including Microsoft , which is a major spender as well.\n\nThere are also several other companies spending billions of dollars on computing equipment that aren't even included on this list, so the reality is that AI spending is going to be as big as ever. While investors may be concerned that companies are spending too much on AI and should be concerned, that doesn't mean you should avoid investing in companies that are making money from AI right now, like Nvidia and Broadcom. Both of these are major computing unit suppliers and will make a boatload of money this year.\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been the go-to AI computing units since the AI boom began in 2023. While Nvidia is seeing more challengers, it's still the top contender thanks to its full technology stack setup that allows end users to purchase everything they need from Nvidia.\n\nAnother company to watch is Broadcom. Instead of offering a GPU that can tackle a wide range of workloads, it's partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to design a chip specifically meant for its needs. Alphabet and Broadcom have already collaborated to produce the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a wildly popular design. As Alphabet's capital expenditures soar, so will its TPU orders, boosting Broadcom's sales.\n\nStory Continues\nThere are also several other hyperscalers who are clients of Broadcom's, and each of them also expects to ramp up consumption of custom AI chips in an effort to diversify away from Nvidia's products.\nEach of these compaines is slated to benefit, but they're also just great buys in general right now.\n\nThese stocks rarely trade at these cheap valuations Wall Street analysts expect both Broadcom and Nvidia to deliver 52% revenue growth this fiscal year. That clearly indicates that the AI boom is far from over, yet the market isn't pricing in this success.\nNvidia is the cheaper of the two, trading for 24 times forward earnings. Broadcom is more expensive at 32 times forward earnings, but its success is far less predictable than Nvidia's due to its concentration with a handful of clients using its chip designs. I still think each of these AI stocks is worth investing in, although I do prefer Nvidia a tad more.\n\nWith the massive amount of money being spent on AI hardware from these three major players, Nvidia and Broadcom's stock should be rising, not falling. But that opposite is going on, so investors should use this opportunity to load up on two of the best growth stocks we've seen in years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "1 Lesser-Known Chip Stock to Snap Up ASAP\n\nFaisal Humayun Khan\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 1:16 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: STM\n\nAMZN\n\nThe global semiconductor industry appears to be going through structural tailwinds. Fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, global semiconductor industry annual sales are projected to touch $975 billion in 2026, a historic peak. Furthermore, with sustained growth, annual sales may touch $2 trillion by 2036.\n\nWith that in mind, it's unsurprising that semiconductor stocks have surged higher. While some investors might have missed out on the big rally, there also still seem to be pockets of opportunity left. Amid volatility, shares of STMicroelectronics (STM) have trended 43% higher in the last 52 weeks. This lesser-known chip stock seems to hold significant potential.\nMore News from Barchart 4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\nPfizer Reports Strong Earnings Outlook - Unusual Call Options Activity Shows Investors are Bullish\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nSTMicroelectronics recently announced a partnership with Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS), and this multi-billion-dollar collaboration underscores the point of scope for value creation. As part of the deal, STM will be a supplier of advanced semiconductor technologies and products to AWS. Further, STM will issue warrants to AWS for up to 24.8 million shares. Besides establishing credibility, this deal is likely to be a top-line growth driver for STMicroelectronics and STM stock.\n\nAbout STM Stock Based in the Netherlands and headquartered in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics is a designer, developer, and manufacturer of semiconductor products globally. The company’s key business segments include RF & Optical Communications, Analog Products, MEMS & Sensors, Embedded Processing, and Power & Discrete Products. In terms of end users, the automotive, industrial and personal electronics segments are business growth drivers for the company.\nFor fiscal 2025, STMicroelectronics reported revenue of $11.8 billion with a gross margin of 33.9%. For the same period, the firm reported free cash flow of $265 million.\nWhile STMicroelectronics reported revenue degrowth in fiscal 2025, SMT stock has trended higher by 28% in the last six months, in part due to a positive long-term outlook backed by key strategic partnerships.\nMultiple Growth Triggers While revenue degrowth is a concern, STM stock has been in an uptrend. After all, the company has multiple growth catalysts in the next few years. The partnership with AWS is one growth trigger. Similarly, the company’s chip supply to SpaceX for Starlink is expected to double in the next two years.\n\nStory Continues\nSTM has also indicated that revenue from silicon carbide power devices is expected to return to 2024 levels by next year. This is after a contraction in revenue in 2025. Further, the firm is targeting data center revenue of $1 billion before the end of the decade.\nIn another important development in December 2025, the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed a €500 million financing agreement with the company. This is the initial tranche for a €1 billion credit line that’s intended to boost Europe’s competitiveness in the semiconductor sector. According to the agreement, 60% of the funds will be utilized toward “high-volume manufacturing capabilities” within Europe while 40% will be dedicated to research & development activities. These investments are likely to translate into growth and provide STM with an innovation edge, especially with the emphasis on R&D.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Say About STM Stock? Given the ratings of 17 analysts, STM stock is a consensus “Moderate Buy.” While eight analysts assign a “Strong Buy” rating to STM, another eight have a “Hold\" rating while one analyst has a bearish “Strong Sell” rating.\nBased on these opinions, STM stock has a mean price target of $33.25 currently, implying potential downside of 1% from current levels. However, the most bullish price target of $45 suggests that STM could rise as much as 34% from here.\nOne important point to note is that STM stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 times. With analysts estimating earnings growth of 100% and 68% for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively, shares will likely remain in an uptrend.\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

They are both growing significantly – with memory a greater growth driver near-term,\" said Timm Schulze-Melander, a Rothschild & Co. Redburn analyst.\nLogic generally refers to a type of chip that is capable of serving as the brains of a system, such as graphics processors and central processing units.\nMEMORY IN FOCUS High-bandwidth memory (HBM), made by stacking layers of dynamic random ‌access memory (DRAM) on top of each other, refers ​to a type of advanced memory chip used alongside ​pricey AI processors such as those sold ​by Nvidia .\nApplied expects DRAM to be its fastest growing segment in ‌2026, coupled with 3D chiplet stacking — a ​technique used extensively in ​producing AI processors — Dickerson said during a post-earnings call.\nThe company reported first-quarter revenue of $7.01 billion, beating estimates of $6.87 billion.\nRevenue for the quarter ended January 25 included record DRAM ​sales on a year-on-year basis, ‌finance chief Brice Hill said during the call.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nThe company reported first-quarter profit of $2.38 ​per share, excluding items.

Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect us can be found in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You can locate these reports through our website at https://investors.arista.com/ and on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov/ . All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and accompanying table contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, gains/losses on strategic investments, and the income tax effect of these non-GAAP exclusions, including the recognition of direct excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, as well as non-recurring adjustments to our tax provision resulting from the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBB Act\"). Effective the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025, the Company updated its methodology for calculating the income tax effect of Non-GAAP adjustments. Previously, the Company’s calculation excluded all tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, consisting of both direct excess tax benefits and other discrete indirect effects. Under the updated methodology, the Company continues to exclude direct excess tax benefits but no longer excludes the discrete indirect effects of such awards. Management believes this change better aligns with industry practice and provides a more meaningful view of the Company’s effective tax rate. All prior period Non-GAAP results presented in this release have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.\n\nThe company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are, therefore, unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nGartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for Data Center Switching, Andrew Lerner et al., 31 March 2025\nGartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure, Mike Leibovitz et al., 25 June 2025\nGARTNER and MAGIC QUADRANT are trademarks of Gartner, Inc. and its affiliates.\nGartner does not endorse any company, vendor, product or service depicted in its publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.\nGartner publications consist of the opinions of Gartner’s business and technology insights organization and should not be construed as statements of fact.

      "Content": "1 Brilliant AI Stock That You Should Buy Hand Over Fist in 2026\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 12:49 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nBroadcom 's (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock rallied nearly 600% over the past five years. Most of that growth was driven by its aggressive acquisitions and its brisk sales of AI chips. Let's see why it could still be one of the best stocks to buy in 2026 as the AI market continues to expand.\nWhy is Broadcom growing so rapidly? From fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2025 (which ended last November), Broadcom's revenue grew at a 22% CAGR from $23.9 billion to $63.9 billion. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) rose at a 26% CAGR from $13.6 billion to $43.0 billion.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nTwo catalysts fueled that expansion. First, it expanded its infrastructure software business through major acquisitions -- including its 2023 takeover of the cloud giant VMware -- to reduce its dependence on the cyclical semiconductor market. Second, it sold more networking, optical, and custom accelerator chips to data centers to support the latest AI applications.\n\nUnlike Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , which sells general-purpose data center GPUs for processing AI tasks, Broadcom sells customized AI accelerators for hyperscalers. In fiscal 2025, Broadcom's AI chip revenue surged 65% to $20 billion. That accounted for 31% of its top line and offset the slower growth of its non-AI chip and infrastructure software businesses.\nWhy will Broadcom continue to grow? Broadcom aims to generate annualized AI chip revenues of $60 billion to $90 billion by the end of fiscal 2027, with most of that growth coming from just three of its hyperscale customers. That rosy outlook suggests the world's largest cloud companies are eagerly developing their own custom AI accelerators with Broadcom to curb their long-term dependence on Nvidia.\nBroadcom will also likely continue to acquire more companies to fortify its AI chipmaking and infrastructure software businesses. Its non-AI chip businesses -- which sell a wide range of wireless, storage, networking, optical, and radio-frequency chips for other markets -- should also benefit from the long-term expansion of the mobile, automotive, and industrial sectors.\nFrom fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at CAGRs of 38% and 36%, as those tailwinds kick in. With an enterprise value of $1.65 trillion, it still looks reasonably valued at 26 times this year's adjusted EBITDA.\n\nStory Continues\nSo if you're looking for a balanced AI stock with plenty of upside potential, Broadcom checks all the right boxes. It might not attract as much attention as Nvidia, but it's also one of the best producers of picks and shovels for the ongoing AI gold rush.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BTDR.\nIs BTDR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nQ : What are the main items being discussed in your co-location negotiations? Is it down to price, duration, timing, or design? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: Discussions vary with different counterparties, covering all those aspects. These discussions are sensitive and active, and while we are confident about closing deals soon, predicting the exact timeframe is challenging.\n\nQ : Regarding financing, what should we expect in terms of debt, cost of capital, and credit enhancements? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The cost of capital will depend on the counterparties and deal terms, making it hard to predict until deals are finalized. Credit enhancements are crucial for determining development costs, and we are exploring various approaches, though nothing dramatically different from existing market practices.\n\nStory Continues\nQ : Can you provide more details on the infrastructure piece, specifically the Tel Norway site and its customer profile? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The Tel Norway site retrofit is expected to complete by year-end, with production GPUs installed early next year. The site benefits from a low PUE of around 1.1 due to its hydropower and cold climate. Customer discussions are sensitive, but there is overlap with US customers.\n\nQ : How should we think about the growth of your Bitcoin mining business in 2026, especially with AI infrastructure deals in play? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: We are long-term believers in Bitcoin and will continue investing in mining capacity. While we haven't projected future hash rates, we remain committed to expanding our self-mining operations.\nQ : With lower Bitcoin prices, is there a point where you would slow mining activity due to higher costs? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: There is a price point where we might slow down, but we haven't reached it yet. Our fleet's efficiency and low energy costs allow us to continue operations even if prices drop further. Older machines might be turned off first, but we don't anticipate reaching that point soon.\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Analog Devices Governance Move Puts Special Meeting Rights In Focus\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 9:17 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nNever miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\nAnalog Devices (NasdaqGS:ADI) has responded to a shareholder proposal seeking changes to special meeting rights.\nThe company is urging investors to vote against the proposal and is pointing to prior changes that lowered the threshold for calling special meetings.\nManagement is highlighting its broader governance approach, including a stated focus on shareholder rights and board accountability.\n\nAnalog Devices, known for its analog and mixed signal semiconductors used in industrial, automotive and communications applications, is putting governance firmly in focus with this response. For you as an investor, special meeting rights touch on how quickly shareholders can react when material issues arise. This can be relevant alongside fundamentals like balance sheet strength or end market exposure.\nBy stressing both the existing special meeting terms and its stance on accountability, Analog Devices is signaling how it wants to manage shareholder influence over major decisions. As you weigh NasdaqGS:ADI, this type of governance disclosure can sit alongside product mix, customer concentration and capital allocation policies when you think about overall risk and oversight quality.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Analog Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Analog Devices.\nSee which insiders are buying and buying and selling Analog Devices following this latest news.\nThis governance update is really about where the balance of power sits between ADI’s board and its shareholders. By urging investors to vote against a further expansion of special meeting rights, the company is arguing that the current 25% threshold already offers meaningful influence while limiting the risk that a small group can force company specific events onto the calendar. For you, this is a signal about how ADI prefers to manage activist pressure and board accountability at a time when interest in the stock has been reinforced by recent earnings beats and positive analyst sentiment. It also shapes how long term holders might think about stability, especially when management is already committing capital to areas such as buybacks and growth investments in data centers, autos and industrial markets.\n\nHow This Fits Into The Analog Devices Narrative The company’s emphasis on “long term shareholder value” and governance discipline aligns with the narrative that ADI is positioning for autos, AI and automation, where consistent execution and board oversight can support multi year product and R&D plans.\nCalls from some shareholders to loosen special meeting rights could challenge that narrative if they signal impatience with capital allocation choices or with how quickly ADI is pursuing opportunities in areas such as AI infrastructure.\nThe investor presentation on special meeting rights adds a governance dimension that is not explicitly covered in the narrative, which mainly focuses on end markets, earnings potential and capital deployment rather than how shareholder rights might influence those plans.\n\nStory Continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Analog Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ A shareholder base that is pushing for easier special meetings may be a sign of rising activism risk, which can lead to distractions for management or pressure for short term moves that do not match your own time horizon.\n⚠️ If some investors view ADI’s stance as too protective of the board, it could create governance related criticism, especially when peers such as Texas Instruments, NXP or Microchip adopt different approaches to shareholder rights.\n🎁 The existing 25% threshold is lower than the prior 80% requirement and may help ADI maintain operational focus while still giving a sizeable group of shareholders the ability to act when they see material issues.\n🎁 Clear communication that the board is focused on accountability and long term value can support confidence for investors who are already watching ADI’s earnings momentum and analyst interest in its data center and auto exposure.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward You will want to see how the vote on the proposal turns out and whether support for the shareholder resolution is high enough to suggest persistent governance pressure. Watch for any follow up from large holders or governance advisory firms, as their reaction can shape future proposals or board engagement. It is also worth tracking how ADI’s board decisions on capital returns, acquisitions and R&D align with this message about long term value, especially compared with peers in the analog and mixed signal space that face similar investor activism.\n\nTo stay informed on how the latest news affects the investment narrative for Analog Devices, visit the community page for Analog Devices to keep up with the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Jihan, Matt, and Haris will be available for questions after the formal remarks. To accompany today's call, we have provided a supplemental investor presentation available on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s investor relations website under Webcasts and Presentations. Before management begins their formal remarks, I would like to remind everyone that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.\n\nFor a more complete discussion on forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties related to Bitdeer Technologies Group's business, please refer to the company's filings with the SEC. In addition to discussing results calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, we will also reference certain non-IFRS financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit and loss. For more detailed information on our non-IFRS financial measures, please refer to our earnings release published earlier today, which can be found on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s IR website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Haris. Thank you, John, and good day, everyone.\nHaris Basit: It is great to be with you today. The 2025 marked a defining period of execution and strategic progress for Bitdeer Technologies Group. Achieved critical milestones across our three strategic pillars, and position the company for sustained growth as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company. I will start with a brief overview of our financial performance for the quarter. Fourth quarter total revenue reached $225,000,000, up 226% year over year and 33% sequentially. Gross profit totaled $10,600,000, adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000 for the quarter.\n\nWhile both metrics declined sequentially, the results primarily reflect a combination of lower average Bitcoin pricing, modestly higher electricity costs, substantially higher depreciation expense due to the rapid expansion of our self-mining capacity, and further investment in new talent to support our growing AI HPC initiatives. I will discuss these factors in greater detail later in the call. Let me begin with a brief review of our power and infrastructure portfolio. We continue to make meaningful progress during the quarter, advancing a global portfolio of sites that we believe are well suited to support both large-scale Bitcoin mining and next-generation AI and HPC workloads.\n\nStory Continues\nAcross regions, our focus remains on developing power-rich, capital-efficient infrastructure that provides flexibility, speed to market, and long-term strategic optionality. From an energy infrastructure perspective, execution during the quarter remained on track. At the January, we had over 1.66 gigawatts of capacity online, and a total global power pipeline of three gigawatts. We believe this represents one of the most attractive and AI-suitable power portfolios in the industry and provides us with a vast opportunity as the demand for such capacity continues to grow. Over the past several months, have seen a significant shift in market dynamics around AI data center development.\n\nDemand for large-scale colocation capacity has increased substantially and we have responded by refining our approach to better align with this opportunity. Therefore, we are currently prioritizing colocation services provided to Norway and the United States that are suitable for large-scale AI HPC deployments. Let me walk through a few sites and where we stand with our development plans. First, Teadle, Norway, represents our most near-term colocation opportunity. This 225-megawatt facility was originally constructed to Tier III data center specifications, which puts us in a favorable position for conversion to AI workloads.\nWe estimate the retrofit will require much less incremental capital expenditure to add uninterruptible power supply systems, backup batteries, and generation, as well as some additional cooling capacity compared to industry benchmarks for greenfield Tier III data center development, which typically run in the $8,000,000 to $12,000,000 per megawatt range. The site benefits from hydropower with attractive economics; independent 100-megawatt transformers provide redundancy. We are currently in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expect to be in a position to announce a signed lease agreement for Teadle as soon as possible in 2026, although the exact timing is very difficult to predict.\n\nThis site should be capable of supporting initial test GPU deployment late 2026 and first production GPUs expected in early 2027. Second, our 570-megawatt site in Clarington represents one of the larger AI data center development opportunities in the United States. Have made progress on two fronts here. First, the local utility has accelerated our interconnection timeline. Second, we are currently in discussion with multiple prospective tenants. These are well recognizable companies in the space, and the discussions are progressing. While litigation has recently been filed that could potentially delay development at this location, believe that we have meritorious claims and a strong defense and will pursue an expedient solution.\nGiven the scale of this site, even a partial or first phase lease would represent a significant milestone for Bitdeer Technologies Group and would provide substantial contracted revenue while derisking our development capital. Third, at Rockdale, we are pursuing a strategy that allows us to maintain our current Bitcoin mining operations while developing new HPC capacity. We are evaluating the acquisition of adjacent land to our existing facility we could potentially construct a purpose-built HPC data center. This approach would minimize disruption during data center development to our 563-megawatt mining operation, which continues to generate revenue. The greenfield HPC build would be designed from the ground up for AI workloads.\n\nThe Rockdale site benefits from its location in the ERCOT market, provides operational flexibility. We are currently talking with prospective colocation tenants for this site. The dual-track approach, maintaining Bitcoin mining while developing HPC capacity, reflects our commitment to both businesses and our ability to optimize our power portfolio across use cases. While we are prioritizing colocation for our larger sites, continue to see opportunity in GPU-as-a-service for targeted markets. We are expanding our cloud platform in Malaysia by 10 to 15 megawatts, building on the success we have had in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming sectors who need fully managed orchestrated infrastructure.\nIn the United States, we are planning to add 10 megawatts of GPU capacity in Washington state and are evaluating a partial conversion of our Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud. I want to be clear that the scale of our long-term US GPU-as-a-service expansion is predicated on signing customer contracts. Do not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. Expect all major GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customers who are seeking meaningful capacity with comprehensive managed services. This disciplined approach ensures we are deploying capital we have revenue certainty. A key element of our strategy is how we are approaching data center development.\n\nWe have built an internal development team with experience in very large data center construction and we are augmenting that team through strategic hires, working with experienced EPC contractors and general contractors on a fee basis rather than through joint venture arrangements. This gives us greater control over timelines and specifications, and importantly, it allows us to retain more of the economic value these assets generate. As we look ahead, the growth will continue to be anchored by our three strategic pillars, between mining, ASIC development, and HPC AI. Together, these represent a vertically integrated, highly defensible platform that leverages our deep technology expertise, proprietary chip design capabilities, and extensive global power portfolio.\n\nThe supply-demand imbalance for AI compute continues to widen, and we expect this shortage to persist well into 2027. Time to power is a critical variable, and we believe Bitdeer Technologies Group is exceptionally well positioned to serve customers seeking both near-term and midterm capacity. On the Bitcoin mining side, the rapid expansion of our self-mining platform continues. We exited the year with more than 55 exahash per second of self-mining hash rate, and in the month of January alone, we brought another eight exahash per second online, exiting the month of January at over 63 exahash per second. This firmly establishes Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miners by total hash rate under management.\n\nSupported by the disciplined rollout of our SealMiner fleet, accelerated deployment of SealMiner rigs has driven material improvements in fleet-wide efficiency. The SealMiner A2 and A3 being actively deployed in our self-mining business operate at approximately 15 to 16.5 joules per terahash and 12.5 to 14 joules per terahash respectively, and represent industry-leading power efficiency. As these next-generation rigs replace legacy third-party equipment, our blended fleet efficiency continues to improve, with our overall fleet-wide efficiency currently standing at 17.5 joules per terahash as of 01/31/2026. As SealMiner penetration increases throughout 2026, we expect our overall fleet-wide efficiency to continue to improve, enhancing our mining margins. Looking ahead, our self-mining operations are not plateauing.\n\nOur investments in chip design are delivering tangible results. During the quarter, we commenced mass production of the SealMiner A3 series. Initial shipments began in November, and we have deployed a total of 8.7 exahash of our SealMiner A3 to date. As we continue to retire older-generation third-party rigs, we expect the A3 series to continue to meaningfully contribute to our fleet efficiency improvements and growth throughout 2026. On the R&D front, our CLO4-1 chip was completed back in September. The CLO4-1 represents a meaningful step forward in efficiency and positions Bitdeer Technologies Group to maintain technological leadership as the industry continues its relentless drive towards lower power consumption per unit of hash rate.\n\nMass production of mining rigs based on the CLO4-1 chip will begin in Q1 2026. CLO4-2 chip design remains under development at our US-based design center. Additionally, we have successfully taped out a new Litecoin chip, SEAL-DL1, designed for Doge and Litecoin mining. The initial test results of SEAL-DL1 have exceeded comparable rigs in both energy efficiency and hash rate. On the recent market conditions, the CLDL1 generates higher fiat-based returns per megawatt than our SealMiner A2. Preparation for USA SealMiner manufacturing remains in progress. This initiative is a core component of our vertically integrated strategy and aligns with both operational resilience objectives and evolving trade and supply chain dynamics.\nNow let me walk through our detailed financial results for the quarter. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that all figures I refer to today are in US dollars. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $224,800,000, up 225.8% year over year and up 32.5% sequentially. The year-over-year growth and sequential growth in revenue was primarily driven by significantly higher self-mining hash rate as a result of continued CLMiner deployment, as well as contributions from SealMiner sales, offset in part by slightly lower Bitcoin prices for the quarter. Self-mining revenue was $168,600,000, compared to $41,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $130,900,000 in Q3 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 306% and a sequential growth of 28.7%.\n\nContinued growth from Q3 2025 levels reflects a significant increase in average operating hash rate and associated Bitcoin production during the quarter, offset in part by 13% lower average Bitcoin prices quarter on quarter. SealMiner sales revenue was $23,400,000, up 105.4% over the $11,400,000 reported in Q3 2025. Total gross profit for the quarter was $10,600,000, reflecting a gross margin of 4.7%, versus 7.4% in Q4 2024 and $40,800,000 or 24.1% in Q3 2025. Significant decline in gross margin reflects the combined impact of several drivers during the quarter. First, obviously, we experienced 13% lower Bitcoin prices during the quarter along with the gradual increase of the global hash rate.\nSecond, on the cost side, experienced an approximately 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit during the quarter when compared to Q3 2025, mainly due to the seasonal winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites. Third, the growth in our self-mining hash rate comes with a concurrent noncash depreciation expense associated with this fleet of new miners. Additionally, during the quarter, we changed our methodology for calculating depreciation expense to reflect a more conservative approach. Now depreciate rigs using a three-year straight-line method versus our prior assumption of a five-year depreciable life for hardware. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $66,300,000 compared to $42,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $60,500,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following factors compared to Q3. We added more headcount to support both mining site operations and our AI infrastructure expansion, incurred additional holiday season compensation, along with an increase in year-end general corporate activities. These expenditures reflect the operational requirements of our growing infrastructure footprint and the resources necessary to execute on our strategic initiatives. Other operating expenses for the quarter was $43,800,000 compared to $3,700,000 in Q4 2024 and other operating income of $26,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to the fair value change of Bitcoins pledged for the Bitcoin-collateralized loan since Q3 2025.\n\nOther net gain for the quarter was $208,900,000 compared to other net loss of $4 and $79,800,000 in Q4 2024 and $238,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to noncash fair value change of derivative liabilities related to the convertible senior notes issued in November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025. Adjusted net loss was $82,600,000 versus $37,400,000 in Q4 2024 and $36,300,000 in Q3 2025. The increase in loss was primarily due to higher energy and depreciation costs, higher operating and interest expense, partially offset by the year-over-year higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000, versus negative $4,300,000 in Q4 2024 and positive $39,600,000 in Q3 2025.\nThe sequential decline was primarily driven by higher energy costs and higher operating expenses attributed to salaries and wages for recent additions to our headcount, as well as a number of elevated costs associated with year-end holiday allowance and year-end general corporate activities. To provide a better sense of our G&A expense on a run-rate basis, our Q4 2025 results reflect approximately $3,000,000 of salary, wage, and benefits expense which will largely be recurring, as well as another $6,000,000 to $7,000,000 in consulting, legal, and travel expenses which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was $599,500,000, primarily driven by SealMiner supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs from the mining business, general corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97,900,000, which includes $50,700,000 of capital expenditures relating to data center infrastructure construction, GPU equipment procurement, and tariffs and freight for mining rigs delivered to the data centers, and $150,600,000 of proceeds from the disposal of cryptocurrencies.\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the quarter $454,500,000, which resulted primarily from $388,500,000 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $168,000,000 in borrowings from a related party, and $141,500,000 of proceeds from shares sold under our ATM and ELOC program, free offset by $171,100,000 of repayments of borrowings. For the full calendar year 2025, capital expenditures for the continued build out of our global power and data center infrastructure totaled $176,000,000. Looking to full year 2026, we anticipate total infrastructure spend in the range of $180,000,000 to $200,000,000 for crypto mining data center construction.\n\nPlease note that this guidance covers power and crypto mining data center infrastructure only and does not include CapEx for SealMiners and GPU. AI cloud and colocation capital expenditures are also not included. Turning to our balance sheet and financial position. We exited the year with $149,400,000 in cash and cash equivalents, $83,100,000 in cryptocurrencies, held at cost less impairment, $135,600,000 in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1,000,000,000 in borrowings excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities were $501,100,000, relate to the November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025 convertible senior notes.\nThis represents $171,400,000 reduction compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a noncash fair value adjustment driven by the change in our stock price and settlement for partial principal of November 2024 convertible senior notes. As I mentioned earlier, this does not impact our liquidity or operations. Regarding our outstanding ATM and ELOC facility, we received approximately $143,600,000 in gross proceeds during the quarter. Approximately 6,700,000 additional shares issued. We have exercised disciplined capital allocation throughout the year using the ATM and ELOC opportunistically to support our growth initiative while minimizing dilution.\n\nAs a final note to our financial update, we wish to note that starting in Q1 2026, we will begin to use GAAP instead of IFRS as our accounting standard. In summary, we are proud of our team's execution this quarter and throughout 2025. I want to express my deep pride what our team has accomplished this year. Established Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the world's largest publicly listed Bitcoin mining operators by total hash rate under management. Our leadership position in self-mining and our proprietary SealMiner technology provide multiple paths to value creation that few, if any, competitors can match.\nOur pipeline of developed and contracted power capacity gives us a meaningful competitive edge in serving a variety of customers. The colocation opportunity ahead of us is immense, we are pursuing it proactively. We enter 2026 with strong operational momentum, a differentiated asset base, and a team that has proven its ability to execute at scale. Excited about what lies ahead and remain committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, Operator. Please open the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open for questions. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press *11 and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press *11 again. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Giles of B. Securities. Your line is now open.\nNick Giles: Yes. Thank you so much, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Haris, really appreciate the comprehensive update, especially on the colocation side. And my first question was just, and I am sure you are speaking to a range of customers, and you know, at this point of negotiations or discussions, what is really the main items that are being discussed? Is it down to price, duration, timing? There is still a lot of work ongoing around design. Just any additional color on where you stand in the process.\n\nHaris Basit: It is different with different potential counterparties, and we are all of those things that you mentioned are being discussed, maybe not with the same counterparty, but you know, I hesitate to say too much about these discussions. They are sensitive, and you know, very active at this time. So you know, we feel pretty confident that we are going to get colocation deals done in the near future. Predicting that time frame is going to be hard. And, you know, the discussions are pretty intense with several counterparties.\nNick Giles: No. Understood. That is helpful, and just my second question was, we think about financing, you made some important comments there on having a larger share of the economics. But should we be expecting in terms of debt cost of capital and what kind of credit enhancements are you looking at, if any?\n\nHaris Basit: Cost of capital for these projects, for the colocation projects, will be very much determined by the counterparties and exact terms of the deal. So I think that is hard to predict right now until we, you know, announce which of these deals are done with which counterparties. Was that responsive to your question? I am not sure if that is what you were.\nNick Giles: Asking.\nHaris Basit: I mean, that is an important part of any deal. And, you know, it is because it does determine the cost of development to a large extent. And so we are, you know, we are looking at many different approaches here. It is a very important part of getting the deal done right. So it is something that we are focusing on as well. I cannot really say which ones are better or worse. It depends a lot on the counterparty, and it depends on, you know, there is a number of ways to do this. Most of them have been already done in the Marketplace.\n\nAnd know, I do not think you will see anything too dramatically different from those when we announce.\nNick Giles: Got it. Understood. Well, again, I appreciate the update, and continue. Best of luck.\nJihan Wu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Colonnese of H.C. Wainwright & Co. Your line is now open.\nMike Colonnese: Today. First one for me on the infrastructure piece. It sounds like you are pretty far along in negotiations for a potential colo deal at the Teadle site. Curious what type of customers you are in discussions with specifically at that campus. And, Haris, if I heard correctly, it sounds like the full retrofit for the 225 megs could be completed by the end of this year. There a PUE you guys are assuming that number? I know it is built with Tier III standards in mind, but any additional color would be helpful there.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is correct. We do expect completion of that Teadle Norway site in at the end of this year and then installation of production GPUs at the beginning of next year. And the PUE at that site is actually very low, which is one of the biggest advantages of that site. It is, you know, it is 100% hydropower. It is a nice cold climate. And there is chilled water available from a nearby lake. So the PUE there, for estimation purposes, is around 1.1. It is dramatically better than most locations.\nMike Colonnese: Got it. And then, the typical customer profile for that site specific, I know you are in discussions with the range of customers across the portfolio. I would be just curious with that international facility, the type of customers you are looking at.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, there is some difference, but, you know, there is still a lot of overlap with the customers there versus customers in the United States. So but, you know, I really do not want to say too much about who we are talking to and the exact nature of those deals. They are fairly sensitive negotiations at this point. Understood. Understood. And then as it relates to the Bitcoin mining business, you guys are one of the few public miners that continue to rapidly expand your self-mining capacity. How should we think about growth in this business in 2026? Particularly as you look to pursue these AI infrastructure deals across parts of the portfolio?\nHaris Basit: So one thing to say is that we are long-term believers in Bitcoin. And, of course, Bitcoin is in a little bit of a down cycle right now. But long term, we believe in Bitcoin. And we will continue to invest in our Bitcoin mining capacity. We have not given any projections for what the total hash rate for our company might be by the end of this year or in any future quarter yet. We are still evaluating that and we may project that at a later time. But at this time, we do not have any projections to share publicly for future growth of our hash rate.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. Thanks for the color, Haris, and best of luck with these opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you, Mike. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.\nKevin Cassidy: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on all this capacity you have activated. But maybe along those lines that was asked before, with the lower Bitcoin prices, is there a price where you slow your mining activity because costs are higher versus what the hash price would be?\nHaris Basit: I am sure there is such a price, so we just have not reached it yet. So you know, our efficiency of our fleet keeps improving. And, so it also, you know, as price goes down, it be the entire fleet. Some parts of the fleet, you know, because of the efficiency and because of the energy price at that location, can continue to operate for quite some, you know, in quite some even further decrease beyond here. And then you will, some of the older machines that have been around for several years, those could be turned off first. Right? In fact, just in our normal upgrade cycle, we will be replacing those.\n\nSo there is, you know, we have not reached that point now, and I do not anticipate that we will. But, you know, of course, there is such a price. It is just much lower than what we are at now.\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. That is good information. I guess as you keep lowering your costs, then you can handle lower Bitcoin prices. But just as another topic, is the GPU-as-a-service, is there a good market for the, say, N minus one GPU clusters rather than spending money on the very leading edge of GPUs? Is there still a need for GPU-as-a-service for the older GPUs?\nHaris Basit: Yes. There is. We are, though, however, typically pursuing the latest and greatest GPUs. But I mean, we still get demand for, you know, even our oldest H100s that we have in Singapore.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi of ROTH. Your line is now open.\nDarren Aftahi: Yes, good morning. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Haris, could you dive a little bit more into sort of the scale and scope of the hires you have made for digital infrastructure towards the end of the year that you spoke to, and then kind of the cadence of continued investment in maybe Q1 and into 2026? I guess, at what point do you feel like you have an adequate team to kind of attack this opportunity?\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, we are very pleased with some of our recent hires. We have hired people with direct expertise in AI, in cloud services. And a lot of those folks have been in the United States, but also in Asia. The team is, you know, the number of people dedicated to this has grown dramatically. I do not think I have an exact number. But we continue to hire. I do not think we have reached, you know, a place where we think we have enough folks yet. But we are still looking for people, especially on the side of the engineering part of building data centers with still open racks there. So no.\n\nI expect that we will continue to hire throughout the year. And a lot of those folks will be in the United States. But, you know, we have also done significant AI hiring in Asia.\nDarren Aftahi: Got it. And then same question on the Rockdale site is sort of twofold. In terms of land acquisition for that, kind of where are you, and what is the timeline on process? And then I know Oncor is supposed to put another substation in, and I think you guys have spoken to additional capacity there. I think it is in the 100-some plus megawatts. But in light of kind of the seesaw that is going on with ERCOT and decision on batching, just kind of curious about your thoughts about prospects of Rockdale actually growing as a site. Thanks.\nHaris Basit: The recent, you know, information around ERCOT and power allocation in that region, we do not believe that applies to the growth at Rockdale. So the 179, up to 179 megawatts that we anticipate we could add there, should not be affected by that. And I say it that way because, of course, we do not know what the exact regulations will be. They are just still under discussion. So we do expect that we will get most of that, if not all of that additional capacity. The land acquisition there is moving forward. You know, it is not done until it is done, but we are, we are, yeah.\n\nI am not sure how to characterize where we are in that process, but, you know, we are actively pursuing it. And we expect that we will finish it. But until we do, it is hard to say exactly when that is going to happen. Great. Appreciate the insights. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Greg Lewis of BTIG. Your line is now open.\nGreg Lewis: Hey. Thank you, and good morning. Good open. Hey, I guess first, I mean, on published numbers, I guess you guys are the bitcoin miner of the listed companies by XFASH. So congrats on that. I did want to talk a little bit about the GPU business. You noted about potential expanse. You should a mouthful. The potential expansion in Malaysia. Know, just kind of curious, is that infrastructure that we are building, are we leasing? And then just kind of how should we think about, you know, the rollout of that, I guess, I think you mentioned 15 megawatts in Malaysia for the GPUs.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is infrastructure that we are leasing. I welcome Matt or Jihan to add to that. They want. But what was the second part of your question? How should we think about the rollout of bringing those 15 megawatts online and generating revenue from that? I mean, we have proactively purchased some, I think, the GB200 NVL72 and installed it just recently there. So that is in place right now. In terms of additional machines there, do not think we have made any announcements at present. So that is actually.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. But it is, but it sounds like it sounds like we could start seeing revenue maybe in the second quarter, and then maybe that scales up sequentially for a couple of quarters?\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I think, John and Matt are closer to that than I am. So I do not know if, is that a, is that a correct statement that you have?\n\nJihan Wu: I think we will be able to deploy GPUs into those infrastructures at the fourth quarter or third quarter of this year. It depends on when that infrastructure will be ready. We will no tests. It will be ready around June. But, and maybe there will be one or two month delays. So I sent 2024 can be more conservative estimation.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Super helpful. Alright. Hey, everybody. Thanks for the time, and have a great day.\nJihan Wu: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham. Your line is now open.\nJohn Todaro: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question and the all the extra hash, bro. I guess, can we just get a bit more color on Clarrington? Like, do you need litigation results before signing an HPC customer there? You view that differently. Maybe any guardrails on timeline there? And then I have a follow-up on the mining piece.\n\nHaris Basit: So because it is litigation, we have to be sort of, you know, more careful in what we say here. You know, our attorneys feel very strongly that we have a very good case here, and the litigation has little merit, and we will, you know, prevail here. And on the business side, we are, you know, exploring alternative that can mitigate the impact of the litigation. I do not really want to say a lot more than that. You know, as we said in our scripted remarks, we do anticipate that there will be, you know, some potential delay. But, you know, we are still confident in the site overall.\nBut it is early days, and we, you know, we are looking at some significant alternatives.\nJihan Wu: Yeah. I think the alternative, alternative here, we have multiple alternative options. Creating alternative options is to solve those problems. I believe it is very critical solving those problems. And at a company level, Clarrington, Rockdale, and our lower chin size, we would be able to have lots of alternatives. Other than Carrington. This is the company level. And under the Clariton level, we believe we have several solutions. So I do not think that we are really caught at this kind of litigation.\n\nJohn Todaro: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then on the that latest tape out for the Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, do you anticipate mining some of these other assets? Alongside Bitcoin? And maybe I was looking at some of the margin profile. It looks like there is still some margin there. But maybe the opportunity in those as well.\nJihan Wu: Well, I think 99% or 98% will still be Bitcoin mining. This autochrome mining operations cannot really be scalable very much due to the market cap. So we count into a very small size operations. But on those, on those capacity, we deploy those manual rates yield out of from those capacity will be significantly improved. So I think it is worth the effort to add some, add some. And then, by the way, this is our first b commanding chip and the manual machines that are designed and manufactured totally depends on our Singapore and the Malaysia office. And the Malaysia operation as well. Malaysia operation, we started to build since last year or earlier.\n\nI think that this product, it also means that our supply chain center in Malaysia has been quite mature. So Malaysia and Vietnam, we will have two supply chain center. For companies. Think it is very strategic and important for the resilience of our business in the future.\nHaris Basit: Understood. That is helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Knoblauch of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\nBrett Knoblauch: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe now that we are several weeks into the year, I am curious if you have any insights into what wafer allocation is going to look like this year compared to last year? And on the back of that, with Bitcoin price coming down, network cash staying resilient, hash price going to kind of near all-time lows, does that, you know, more incentivize you guys to use manufacturing capacity for, call it, internal use rather than sell external? Or how should we kind of look at the split between what you guys manufacture for yourselves Versus sell this year? Thank you.\n\nJihan Wu: We cannot tell the exact number or situation with the different allocation, but we have a really good relationships. And even though the we all know that the demand for AI business is huge, several times. Then take them to rehab, but we will get some co coda from additional capacity. And the hash price drops to historically due now recently. And it became very difficult for sending the money works with profit. But we have our own capacities or electricity cost is one of the lowest on the market. And our CapEx, so perhaps combined together, we are the lowest on the market.\nSo our self money definitely became kind of very defensive, very safe strategy for our companies to make sure that even though in this kind of environment, our Bitcoin mining operations will be profitable. So self deployment will be a very important strategy in 2006, especially in the kind of a very bearish marketplace. I think our market share for the Bitcoin mining output will continue to grow. Into something.\n\nHaris Basit: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl of Northland. Your line is now open.\nMike Grondahl: Hey, thank you. Hey, Haris, I just wanted to ask, on the November call, there was a significant emphasis on, you know, GPU rental, and that is what Bitdeer Technologies Group wanted to do. And now it seems like you are adjusting that a little bit on some of the larger sites, you know, colocation. Can you just talk about pivot away or why you are seemingly deemphasizing GPU rental at some of those large sites?\nHaris Basit: Maybe, Jihan, do you want to do that answer first, and then I can chime in if there is still.\nJihan Wu: Yes. I as an on the very live site, colocation is kind of very natural and good choice for a company. And for GPU rental, we have a smaller size Washington State and Tennessee State. We can absolutely handle that ourselves. And maybe a larger capacitors for a lot of interest is besides, like, 10 megawatts or 50 megawatts. They want the nitrocytes anyway, and the nitrocytes in before company better to have some coefficient deal.\n\nHaris Basit: Do you have another question, Mike?\nMike Grondahl: No. So hey. Just so I understand, you have just sort of the larger sites, you will go colocation. The smaller ones, you go GPU rental. I guess that was kinda my takeaway. Is that fair?\nHaris Basit: Yes. That is correct. Got it.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line Steven Glagola of KBW. Your line is now open.\nSteven Glagola: Hey, thanks for the question. I have two. First for Haris. I would like to clarify whether Bitdeer Technologies Group’s US AI cloud expansion and potential expansion in Washington and Tennessee is dependent on securing multiyear reserve capacity agreements? And if so, one of those commitments would primarily be for bare metal deployments. That is one. And then second, for Jihan and Matt, you know, it would be helpful to hear your perspective on why USA cloud expansion is strategically attractive at this stage. You know, how do you think about sort of long-term competitive advantages in AI cloud as you broaden beyond your current Asia-centric footprint? Thank you.\n\nHaris Basit: So the first part, our expansion of GPU in the United States is dependent on, you know, signing contracts, at least any significant large-scale expansion is. You know, we can speculatively do small expansion in the United States. But as we said in the statement, anything significant would be backed by contracts.\nJihan Wu: And we have our own data centers. I think that is very important advantage right now in the US market. Means that under the end of this year, we will be able to deploy the H300 and about rubings with our own data centers. In the United States right now is the center of AI innovation globally. The demand in US market is so much stronger than any other market. And also the US customers also just one. Capacity on US soil. So we have this kind of capacity in US. And we are going to build it, and then we can build it. We will finish it.\n\nI think this will be the most important advantage on the market right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you.

      "Content": "Reinhart Partners Bets on Sports Growth With Madison Square Garden Sports Purchase\n\nJake Lerch, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 8:27 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: FCNCA\n\nSIMO\n\nYETI\n\nIDCC\n\nOn February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners disclosed a new position in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (NYSE:MSGS) , acquiring 214,891 shares in an estimated $55.59 million trade based on quarterly average pricing.\nWhat Happened According to an SEC filing dated February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners initiated a new position in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp., purchasing 214,891 shares. The estimated transaction value was $55.59 million, calculated using the average price during the quarter. The fund’s quarter-end stake in MSGS was valued at $55.59 million, with the net position change reflecting both purchase volume and share price fluctuation in the period.\nWhat Else to Know This was a new position for the fund, representing 1.66% of its 13F reportable assets under management.\nTop five holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares of MSGS were priced at $279.76, up 34.3% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 by 19.92 percentage points.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nMarket Capitalization\n$6.73 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.07 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n($16.56 million)\nPrice (as of market close February 10, 2026)\n$279.76\n\nCompany Snapshot Operates professional sports franchises, including the New York Knicks (NBA), New York Rangers (NHL), development league teams, and esports organizations\nOwns and manages sports assets, generating revenue from media rights, sponsorships, and merchandising\nServes sports fans, media partners, and corporate sponsors, with a focus on the New York metropolitan area and global sports audiences\nMadison Square Garden Sports Corp. is a leading owner and operator of major professional sports franchises, leveraging iconic brands such as the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. The company capitalizes on its strong market presence and diversified sports assets to drive revenue from multiple streams, including media, sponsorship, and merchandising. Its strategic focus on marquee teams and premier sports entertainment positions it as a key player in the U.S. sports and entertainment industry.\n\nWhat This Transaction Means For Investors Recently, Reinhart Partners, a Wisconsin-based investment management firm, acquired approximately 215,000 shares of Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (MSGS) valued at around $55.6 million. Here’s what it means for investors.\nTo begin, MSGS stock has performed well recently. Over the last five years, shares of MSGS have advanced by 63%, with much of that gain coming in the last year alone. MSGS operates legendary sports franchises, including the New York Rangers and New York Knicks.\n\nStory Continues\nAcross sports leagues like the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA), franchise values are soaring. In addition, video streaming services and advertisers are desperate to land exclusive rights to must-watch live events, with sports being the most sought-after category.\n\nTherefore, organizations like MSGS (and their associated leagues) now find themselves in a powerful position to negotiate lucrative media rights deals with both local, national, and even international distributors. All that said, MSGS still remains a relatively small company (market cap of around $6 billion). Moreover, it remains stubbornly unprofitable, with a net income of ($16.6 million) over the last 12 months.\nTo close, investors may want to tread with caution. While MSGS stock does have great potential, its lack of consistent profitability could hold it back.

      "Content": "Investment Manager Doubles Down on Paycom, Acquires $95 Million Worth of Shares\n\nJake Lerch, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 7:51 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: PAYC\n\nFCNCA\n\nSIMO\n\nYETI\n\nIDCC\n\nOn February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners disclosed a significant buy of Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) , adding 537,726 shares in a transaction estimated at $95.28 million based on quarterly average pricing.\nWhat Happened According to an SEC filing dated February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners increased its holding in Paycom by 537,726 shares. The estimated transaction value was $95.28 million, based on the average closing price during the quarter. At quarter-end, the value of the stake rose by $82.74 million compared to the prior period, a figure that includes both the impact of share purchases and market price changes.\nWhat Else to Know The move was a buy, resulting in Paycom accounting for 2.9% of the fund’s reportable assets as of December 31, 2025.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares were priced at $124.94, down 38.5% over the past year and trailing the S&P 500 by 53.0 percentage points.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$2.00 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$453.20 million\nDividend yield\n1.3%\n\nCompany Snapshot Provides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions, including payroll, talent acquisition, time and labor management, and analytics applications.\nOperates a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, generating recurring revenue from subscription fees for its suite of integrated HCM tools.\nServes small to mid-sized businesses in the United States seeking comprehensive workforce management and compliance solutions.\nPaycom provides cloud-based HCM software delivered through a SaaS model, offering end-to-end workforce management solutions for small to mid-sized businesses in the United States.\n\nWhat This Transaction Means For Investors Reinhart Partners, a Wisconsin-based investment management firm, acquired approximately $95 million worth of Paycom shares during the fourth quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2025). Here’s what investors should take away from this transaction.\nFirst off, it’s important to contextualize this purchase. Paycom shares have been in steady decline for several years. Indeed, since 2021, Paycom stock has fallen by roughly 70%. While there are many reasons for this slide, the biggest has to be the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMany analysts are concerned that AI will serve as a replacement to many ‘off-the-shelf’ software products — particularly in the field of payroll and human resources. That would be a major problem for Paycom, whose business model revolves around the sale of such products. What’s more, the concern isn’t simply theoretical. Paycom’s revenue growth has slowed from 30% in 2021 to under 10% in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s not to say that Paycom stock can’t bounce back. However, given the rapid development of AI, SaaS companies like Paycom remain at risk. While Paycom stock could be the right choice for investors betting on a turnaround, average investors may be wise to consider these tech stocks to watch in 2026 .\n\nShould you buy stock in Paycom Software right now? Before you buy stock in Paycom Software, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paycom Software wasn’t one of them.

Bitdeer’s total revenue for the quarter was triple the $69.0 million it reported in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe #1 podcast for emerging tech stocks, Bitcoin, and weekly news analysis. Subscribe to the Blockspace Podcast here, on Apple, Spotify, or anywhere you listen to podcasts.\nThe surge in top-line growth stemmed primarily from the expansion of self-mining operations, which generated $168.6 million during the quarter. Bitdeer expanded its proprietary hashrate to 58.0 EH/s, up from 8.9 EH/s in the prior year period, and expanded its total hashrate under management to 71 EH/s.\nBitdeer mined 1,673 bitcoin in the quarter, a sharp rise from the 469 bitcoin produced a year earlier. It improved its bitcoin mining fleet efficiency to 17.9 J/TH as the firm replaced older machines with its proprietary SEALMINER rigs.\nBitdeer sales of SEALMINER rigs and accessories contributed $23.4 million to quarterly revenue. Bitdeer recently taped out its new SEAL-DL1 chip for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining as production of its bitcoin mining rigs topped 65 EH/s in January.\n\nBitdeer earned $2.3 million from its HPC and AI Cloud segment for the quarter. The firm recently deployed NVIDIA GB200 systems in a Malaysian data center to service AI workloads. This move aligns with Bitdeer’s stated dual-track strategy to leverage high-performance computing demand.\nThe company’s management outlined a strategic shift toward AI/HPC infrastructure, prioritizing colocation models for its largest power assets. Matt Kong, Chief Business Officer, noted the firm plans to prioritize colocation for sites like Tydal, Norway, and Clarington, Ohio, to capture superior economics.\nThe timeline for the 570 MW Clarington project remains under review following legal complications. Bitdeer faces a lawsuit from a neighboring tenant alleging the data center plans violate shared infrastructure rights. This dispute has introduced uncertainty regarding the deployment schedule for one of the company’s largest sites under development.\nBitdeer’s balance sheet featured $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, with an additional 2,017 bitcoin valued at approximately $218.6 million. Bitdeer’s debt stands at $1.0 billion following recent convertible note issuances.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Bitdeer Technologies Group Q4 Earnings Call Highlights\n\nMarketBeat\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 7:34 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: BTDR\n\nBTC-USD\n\nLTC-USD\n\nKey Points Revenue surged 225.8% YoY to $224.8 million in Q4 2025, but gross profit fell to $10.6 million (4.7% margin) as a ~13% lower average Bitcoin price, higher electricity costs and a shift to a three‑year depreciation schedule materially pressured profitability.\nBitdeer is rapidly scaling self‑mining and hardware: self‑mining revenue hit $168.6 million, the company exited 2025 with >55 EH/s and topped >63 EH/s in January, began mass production of SEALMINER A3 and plans SEAL04‑1 volume production in Q1 2026 (SEAL‑DL1 Litecoin chip taped out).\nThe firm is pivoting toward AI/HPC colocation and GPU-as-a-Service with 1.66 GW online and a 3 GW pipeline (key sites Tydal, Clarington, Rockdale), while reporting heavy cash use (net operating cash outflow $599.5 million), ~$1.0 billion of borrowings and a switch to GAAP reporting in Q1 2026.\nInterested in Bitdeer Technologies Group? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\n4 Blockchain Stocks That Aren’t Coinbase\nBitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported fourth-quarter 2025 revenue of $224.8 million, up 225.8% year over year and 32.5% sequentially, as the company highlighted continued scale-up in self-mining and growing focus on AI and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure opportunities. Management described the quarter as a period of “execution and strategic progress” as Bitdeer positions itself as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company.\nQuarterly results reflect higher scale, but lower Bitcoin pricing and higher costs For the fourth quarter, Bitdeer posted gross profit of $10.6 million, representing a gross margin of 4.7%, down from 24.1% in the third quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.2 million, compared with $39.6 million in the prior quarter and negative $4.3 million in Q4 2024.\n→ Once Upon A Farm: Buy the $1B Growth Story?\nBeyond the Halving: The Future of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\nChief Strategy Officer Haris Basit said the sequential decline in profitability primarily reflected a 13% lower average Bitcoin price versus Q3 2025, a roughly 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit driven mainly by winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites, and “substantially higher depreciation expense” tied to rapid expansion of self-mining capacity. The company also increased headcount to support mining operations and AI/HPC initiatives and incurred higher year-end compensation and corporate activity costs.\nBitdeer also changed its depreciation methodology to a more conservative approach, moving to a three-year straight-line method for mining rigs compared with a prior five-year useful life assumption, which contributed to higher depreciation expense.\n\nStory Continues\nSelf-mining growth drives revenue; margins pressured by network and pricing dynamics → No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\nSelf-mining revenue was $168.6 million, up from $41.5 million in Q4 2024 and $130.9 million in Q3 2025. Management attributed the quarter-over-quarter increase to a higher average operating hash rate and Bitcoin production, partially offset by lower Bitcoin prices and a gradual rise in global network hash rate.\nBitdeer also reported $23.4 million in SEALMINER sales revenue, up 105.4% from $11.4 million in Q3 2025.\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\n\nOn fleet expansion, Basit said Bitdeer exited 2025 with more than 55 exahash per second (EH/s) of self-mining hash rate and added another 8 EH/s in January, exiting the month at more than 63 EH/s. As of January 31, 2026, overall fleet efficiency stood at 17.5 joules per terahash, with SEALMINER A2 and A3 rigs operating at approximately 15–16.5 J/TH and 12.5–14 J/TH, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Bitdeer commenced mass production of the SEALMINER A3 series, with initial shipments beginning in November and 8.7 EH/s deployed to date. Basit said mass production of rigs based on the SEAL04-1 chip is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026, while SEAL04-2 remains under development at the company’s U.S.-based design center. Bitdeer also announced it taped out a Litecoin chip (SEAL-DL1) designed for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, with initial test results said to exceed comparable rigs in energy efficiency and hash rate. CEO Jihan Wu noted the company expects “99% or 98%” of operations to remain Bitcoin-focused, while adding that small-scale altcoin mining could improve yields on certain capacity.\n\nIn Q&A, management said there is a Bitcoin price level that could prompt the company to slow mining activity, but it “hasn’t reached it yet,” adding that higher-efficiency portions of the fleet could operate through further price declines while older machines would be turned off first.\nPower portfolio and AI strategy: colocation prioritized for larger sites Bitdeer emphasized progress on its global power and infrastructure footprint. Basit said the company had more than 1.66 gigawatts (GW) of capacity online at the end of January and a total global power pipeline of 3 GW. Management said it is prioritizing colocation services at AI-suitable sites in Norway and the U.S., reflecting increased demand for large-scale colocation capacity.\nKey site updates included:\nTydal, Norway: A 225-megawatt facility built to Tier 3 data center specifications. Basit said retrofit capex should be lower than typical greenfield Tier 3 development benchmarks of $8 million to $12 million per MW. The site uses hydropower and includes independent 100 MW transformers for redundancy. Management said it is in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expects to be able to announce a signed lease “as soon as possible in 2026,” though timing is difficult to predict. In Q&A, Basit said estimated PUE is around 1.1, citing hydropower, cold climate, and chilled water availability from a nearby lake. He added the company expects completion of the Tydal site by the end of the year, with production GPU installation at the beginning of next year.\nClarington (U.S.): A 570-megawatt site where the local utility has accelerated the interconnection timeline, and the company is in discussions with “well recognizable companies” as prospective tenants. Management disclosed litigation has been filed that could delay development, but said it believes it has a strong defense and is exploring alternatives to mitigate impact.\nRockdale (Texas): Bitdeer said it is evaluating acquisition of adjacent land to develop greenfield HPC capacity while maintaining its existing 563 MW Bitcoin mining operation. Management said it believes expected additional capacity of up to 179 MW should not be affected by recent ERCOT discussions, though regulations remain under discussion.\n\nWu characterized the company’s approach as using colocation for very large sites while pursuing GPU-as-a-Service for smaller sites such as Washington State and Tennessee/Knoxville, where Bitdeer believes it can manage deployments directly.\nGPU cloud expansion tied to contracts; Malaysia leasing and U.S. build plans Bitdeer said it continues to see opportunities for GPU-as-a-Service in targeted markets and is expanding its cloud platform in Malaysia by 10–15 MW, building on activity in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming. In the U.S., the company plans to add 10 MW of GPU capacity in Washington State and is evaluating a partial conversion of its Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud.\nManagement stressed that significant U.S. GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customer contracts and that it does not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. In response to an analyst question, Basit reiterated that major U.S. AI cloud expansion is dependent on signing contracts.\n\nOn Malaysia, management said the infrastructure is being leased. Wu added the timeline to deploy GPUs depends on infrastructure readiness, noting it was expected around June but that delays are common; he suggested Q3 or Q4 as a more conservative estimate.\nCash flow, financing activity, and accounting change Bitdeer reported net cash used for operating activities of $599.5 million, which management said was primarily driven by SEALMINER supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs, corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97.9 million, including $50.7 million of capital expenditures and $150.6 million in proceeds from cryptocurrency disposals. Net cash generated from financing activities was $454.5 million, driven mainly by $388.5 million of proceeds from convertible senior notes, $168 million in related-party borrowings, and $141.5 million of proceeds from shares sold under its ATM and ELOC program, partially offset by $171.1 million in repayments.\n\nOn the balance sheet, Bitdeer ended the year with $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $83.1 million in cryptocurrencies held at cost less impairment, $135.6 million in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1.0 billion in borrowings, excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities tied to convertible senior notes were $501.1 million, which management said reflected non-cash fair value adjustments and did not impact liquidity or operations.\nFor capital spending, Bitdeer said full-year 2025 infrastructure capex totaled $176 million. For 2026, it anticipates $180 million to $200 million of infrastructure spend for crypto mining data center construction, excluding capex for SEALMINERS, GPUs, AI cloud, and colocation.\n\nBasit also noted the company will begin using GAAP instead of IFRS starting in the first quarter of 2026.\nAbout Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) Bitdeer Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:BTDR) is a global digital asset mining and computing services provider focused on delivering secure and efficient hashrate solutions to institutional and retail customers.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nTD Cowen upgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $159, citing valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 30% year-to-date. Shopify's \"strong\" quarter, continued growth momentum and the post-earnings pullback \"represents an attractive entry point for investors to own the de facto modern-day eCommerce infrastructure,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho also upgraded Shopify to Outperform from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $150.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded BorgWarner (BWA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $82, up from $46. The firm says the company's entrance into the AI data center market is a \"pivotal shift.\"\nBarclays upgraded Analog Devices (ADI) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $375, up from $315. The company has the highest industrial exposure within the analog group \"by far\" and a strong correlation between its sales growth and the Purchasing Managers' Index, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan upgraded MercadoLibre (MELI) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $2,800, up from $2,650. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade following the stock's recent underperformance.\nWilliam Blair upgraded Fastly (FSLY) to Outperform from Market Perform without a price target. The company reported a \"stellar\" quarter driven by rising contribution from agentic AI traffic, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nMonness Crespi downgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Sell from Buy with a $120 price target as the firm is cutting estimates \"again\" ahead of the company's Q4 report. The firm says its prior assumption of a steady recovery over the course of calendar 2026 was \"foolish\" given the typical length and magnitude of crypto bear markets, telling investors that it now models softness through the first half of 2026 and sets its calendar 2026 and 2027 estimates below the Street view.\nJPMorgan downgraded Kraft Heinz (KHC) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $22, down from $24. The company reported a Q4 beat but its 2026 organic sales growth and earnings outlooks were below consensus estimates, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBofA downgraded Icon (ICLR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $75, down from $195, after the company announced an internal board investigation into accounting practices and controls and noted that preliminary indications are that the company may have overstated revenues in 2023-2024 by up to 2% each fiscal year. Leerink also downgraded Icon but to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $105, down from $220.\nWells Fargo downgraded Inspire Medical (INSP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $70, down from $145. The firm says that while significant downside risk to Inspire's 2026 revenue seems less likely with its IV system availability, there is too much uncertainty about physician reimbursement that is likely to remain an overhang on shares for some time. Baird also downgraded Inspire Medical to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $74, down from $130.\nRBC Capital downgraded Humana (HUM) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $189, down from $322.

The firm believes Microchip is at risk of losing share in microcontrollers.\nBarclays initiated coverage of On Semi (ON) with an Equal Weight rating and $75 price target. On Semi's high China and auto exposure are \"well understood\" overhangs on the shares, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nStifel initiated coverage of Sterling Infrastructure (STRL) with a Buy rating and $486 price target. As the largest excavating contractor in the U.S., the firm likes Sterling's \"outsized exposure\" to secular growth themes, including AI and cloud computing, onshoring, and e-commerce.\nTD Cowen initiated coverage of D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) with a Buy rating and no price target. The company's leadership in quantum annealing is driving growth and high margins, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nH.C. Wainwright initiated coverage of Immunome (IMNM) with a Buy rating and $40 price target.

O’Malley wrote that ADI has “the most leverage to Industrial exposure,” making it the most attractive way to position for an upturn.\nBy contrast, Barclays initiated Microchip at Equal Weight, noting the company is exposed to networking and memory demand from AI data-center buildouts but faces challenges including “a difficult spot from a leverage perspective” and “share loss in low end MCUs.”\nThe bank assigned the stock an $80 price target.\nBarclays also started coverage of ON Semiconductor at Equal Weight with a $75 target, citing upside from rising data-center dollar content in the move to 800-volt architectures.\n\nHowever, O’Malley said the stock cannot “break out” without a broader recovery in auto demand, which “remains mum for foreseeable future.”\nBarclays added that each company in the group faces at least one industry-specific challenge, reinforcing its preference for ADI’s mix of industrial leverage and balance-sheet strength.\nRelated articles\nBarclays upgrades Analog Devices as industrial recovery takes shape\nThese 2 stocks are best positioned to benefit from higher uranium prices: analyst\n5 reasons why Jefferies thinks Meta’s pullback is a buying opportunity\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

This compares to a loss of $3.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -430.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.28, delivering a surprise of -481.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\nBITDEER TEC GRP, which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $224.84 million for the quarter ended December 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $69.02 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nBITDEER TEC GRP shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.4%.\nWhat's Next for BITDEER TEC GRP? While BITDEER TEC GRP has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for BITDEER TEC GRP was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.16 on $203.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.15 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Cricut, Inc. (CRCT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2025. The results are expected to be released on March 3.\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nCricut, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $198.69 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Soft Earnings Are Actually Better Than They Appear\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:44 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nThe most recent earnings report from QUALCOMM Incorporated ( NASDAQ:QCOM ) was disappointing for shareholders. However, our analysis suggests that the soft headline numbers are getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nA Closer Look At QUALCOMM's Earnings As finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nQUALCOMM has an accrual ratio of -0.29 for the year to December 2025. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$13b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$5.37b. Over the last year, QUALCOMM's free cash flow remained steady.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On QUALCOMM's Profit Performance Happily for shareholders, QUALCOMM produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that QUALCOMM's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of QUALCOMM.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of QUALCOMM's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity , or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Cadence ChipStack AI Super Agent Puts EDA Role In Focus\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:12 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CDNS\n\nNVDA\n\nQCOM\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nCadence Design Systems (NasdaqGS:CDNS) has introduced the ChipStack AI Super Agent, described as a first-of-its-kind agentic AI solution for front-end silicon design and verification.\nThe platform uses multiple virtual engineers powered by Cadence’s existing EDA tools, with the company indicating potential productivity gains of up to tenfold in chip design workflows.\nEarly adoption by Nvidia and Qualcomm, along with Cadence’s investment in robotics AI, points to growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to semiconductor and intelligent device development.\n\nFor you as an investor, this update sits at the intersection of electronic design automation and accelerating AI chip development. Cadence Design Systems, through its core EDA software and AI driven workflows, plays a role in how complex processors and systems on chip move from concept to tape out. As chipmakers look for ways to manage design complexity and time to market, tools that automate front-end design and verification are increasingly central to their operations.\nThe ChipStack AI Super Agent and the company’s robotics AI focus may influence how Cadence positions itself with customers building next generation AI centric hardware and intelligent devices. As you evaluate NasdaqGS:CDNS, it can be useful to watch how widely ChipStack is deployed, how it fits alongside competing design flows, and how customers integrate these AI agents into their broader engineering processes.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Cadence Design Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Cadence Design Systems.\nWe've flagged 0 risks for Cadence Design Systems. See which could impact your investment.\nThis launch pushes Cadence further into AI-powered automation for chip design, an area where it already has a deep presence through tools like Verisium, Cerebrus and the JedAI platform. By coordinating multiple virtual engineers across coding, test creation, regression, debugging and auto fixes, ChipStack is aimed directly at the cost and time bottlenecks that large chipmakers care about most. Early use by Nvidia, Qualcomm and others is a signal that key customers see value in tighter AI integration across their existing Cadence workflows rather than standalone tools. For you, the key question is whether ChipStack can move from early access to broad, paid deployment across those accounts and beyond, which could influence how sticky Cadence’s platform is versus rivals such as Synopsys and Siemens EDA.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Cadence Design Systems Narrative The ChipStack launch lines up with the narrative that AI-driven design tools and partnerships with large chipmakers can support future revenue growth, especially as customers look for higher productivity in advanced AI and high-performance-compute designs.\nIf ChipStack requires heavier R&D and cloud infrastructure spending to support complex agentic workflows at scale, it could challenge expectations for steadily rising profit margins over time.\nThe narrative focuses on AI design tools and IP demand but gives less attention to Cadence’s push into robotics AI and Physical AI via investments such as Trener Robotics, which could add another leg to the long-term story if it gains traction.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Cadence Design Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider Higher dependence on large AI-chip customers such as Nvidia and Qualcomm could increase Cadence’s exposure if those relationships weaken or design cycles slow.\nCompetitive responses from Synopsys, Siemens EDA or newer AI-tool vendors could pressure pricing or limit how much ChipStack adoption Cadence ultimately achieves.\nChipStack aims to deliver up to 10x productivity gains in front-end design and verification, which could strengthen Cadence’s value proposition and support premium pricing for its broader EDA stack.\nEarly use across several leading chip designers and a reported multi billion dollar backlog suggest Cadence is already embedded in critical AI and data-center projects, giving it a platform to cross sell new AI agents.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on how often management references ChipStack wins in future updates, especially any comments on seat growth, usage-based revenues or expansion within existing top customers. Watch for signs of competitive products from other EDA vendors and whether customers are standardising on agent-based design flows or treating them as optional add ons. You might also track how Cadence links ChipStack with newer areas such as robotics AI, since success there would show that its AI tools can extend beyond classic semiconductor design into a broader intelligent-device market.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Cadence Design Systems, head to the community page for Cadence Design Systems to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The 30-day share price return is 21.35% and the 90-day share price return is 61.59%, while the 1-year total shareholder return of 166.80% signals powerful momentum that current earnings and dividend announcements are helping to reinforce.\nIf SIMO’s recent move has caught your attention, it can be useful to see what else is on the move in related areas. This includes a curated list of 34 AI infrastructure stocks for more ideas tied to data and compute demand trends.\nWith SIMO now trading near US$139.94 and the average analyst target only moderately higher, the key question is whether recent earnings, guidance and dividends leave more upside on the table or if the market is already pricing in future growth.\n\nMost Popular Narrative: 22.8% Overvalued Simply Wall St's most followed narrative pegs Silicon Motion Technology's fair value at $114.00, which sits well below the recent $139.94 share price, so the market is currently paying a premium to that storyline.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious what kind of revenue climb and margin profile need to line up to back that $114.00 tag at an above market discount rate and forward earnings multiple? The full narrative walks through the earnings bridge, the implied scale up in profitability and the valuation gear shift that has to occur to reconcile today’s price with those long range cash flow assumptions.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $114.00 (OVERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, those assumptions can break if intense price competition hits margins harder than expected or if customer concentration leads to lumpier orders than analysts currently model.\nFind out about the key risks to this Silicon Motion Technology narrative.\n\nStory Continues\nAnother View: Earnings Multiple Paints A Different Picture That $114.00 fair value comes from one set of long term cash flow assumptions, but the market is also clearly looking at the current P/E. At 38.8x earnings, SIMO sits below the US Semiconductor industry at 44.6x and peers at 47.7x, yet above its own fair ratio of 30.6x. This suggests investors are paying up for its story.

      "Content": "Intel AI Push Deepens With SambaNova Bet And New GPU Chief\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 5:08 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSANS.PVT\n\nQCOM\n\nGet insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\nIntel (NasdaqGS:INTC) is committing at least US$100 million to AI chip startup SambaNova Systems.\nThe company has also appointed former Qualcomm executive Eric Demers as its new Chief GPU Architect.\nBoth moves reflect a shift in how Intel is approaching AI chips and GPU development.\n\nIntel, known for its x86 processors and data center products, is increasingly tied to demand for AI computing across cloud, enterprise, and edge use cases. The SambaNova investment adds capital to a specialist in AI hardware and software, at a time when dedicated AI chips have become an important focus for chipmakers.\nFor you as an investor, these steps highlight where Intel is trying to compete more directly in AI accelerators and GPUs, rather than relying only on its existing CPU franchise. The combination of external investment and a new GPU leader may lead to product and partnership changes that you can monitor over upcoming product cycles.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Intel by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 2 things going right for Intel that every investor should see.\nFor Intel, putting at least US$100 million into SambaNova and hiring Eric Demers looks like a move to close gaps in AI accelerators and high performance GPUs, where Nvidia and AMD currently set the pace. SambaNova gives Intel closer access to AI-specific chip design and software stacks, while Demers brings experience from another large chipmaker in building competitive GPU roadmaps. Together, these steps point to Intel trying to serve hyperscalers that are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI data centers, not just with CPUs and foundry capacity but with a fuller portfolio of accelerators. The flip side is execution risk. Intel is already investing heavily in new manufacturing nodes and materials, and layering a deeper AI chip push on top of that raises questions about focus, timelines and returns on capital. If Intel can coordinate its CPU, GPU, custom AI silicon and foundry efforts around what large cloud and enterprise buyers actually want, this news could represent a meaningful evolution of its data center business model. If that coordination does not materialize, it could simply add complexity without a clear payoff.\n\nHow This Fits Into The Intel Narrative The SambaNova investment and Demers hire align with the narrative that Intel is refocusing on AI workloads and foundry partnerships, potentially supporting the idea that a clearer product roadmap can improve competitiveness and customer trust.\nThese moves also test the concern that organizational complexity and slow AI adaptation can hold Intel back, because successfully integrating an external startup and a senior GPU leader requires faster decision making and tighter execution than in the past.\nThe specific exposure to AI accelerators and software centric AI platforms through SambaNova is not fully captured in a general AI and foundry narrative, so investors may want to factor in how this partnership could change Intel’s mix of revenue and R&D priorities over time.\n\nStory Continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Intel to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Intel already faces execution challenges in manufacturing and product rollouts, so adding another AI partnership and a new GPU leader could stretch management focus and prolong the time it takes for these efforts to show up in results.\n⚠️ Competition from Nvidia, AMD and specialized AI chip players means that even with SambaNova and a high profile GPU architect, Intel still has to convince hyperscalers that its AI stack is differentiated enough to win design slots.\n🎁 If Intel can integrate SambaNova’s AI hardware and software know-how with its CPU and foundry offerings, it could offer more complete solutions for cloud and enterprise buyers looking to standardize on fewer suppliers.\n🎁 Analysts have highlighted both risks and rewards for Intel, and this AI focused move relates directly to the potential reward that comes from better aligning Intel’s products with the long term growth in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, you may want to track whether Intel and SambaNova announce concrete co-developed products, reference customers or design wins with large cloud providers and enterprises. Progress updates from Intel on how Demers is shaping its GPU roadmap, and how those GPUs are positioned against Nvidia and AMD in AI training and inference, will also matter. On the financial side, watch for any management commentary on how AI accelerators, GPUs and related software contribute to the data center segment, and whether these investments change Intel’s capital allocation priorities.

The plunge can be attributed to the company’s not-so-impressive guidance, as well as operational headwinds. KLA now expects third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $3.35 billion (+/- $150 million), reflecting a modestly weak product mix on a sequential basis. The guidance also reflects the rapidly escalating cost of DRAM chips used in KLA’s image processing computers that ship with its systems, thereby hurting gross margin. Increasing lead times of its products due to supply constraints and negative tariff impact, roughly 100 bps, are headwinds in the near term.\n\nSo, what should investors do with KLA shares?

KLA is benefiting from its dominant process control market share, strong AI infrastructure investment and momentum in advanced packaging.\n\nThe company has outperformed peers, including Applied Materials AMAT, ASML Holding ASML and Axcelis Technologies ACLS, in the past year. Shares of Applied Materials, ASML Holding and Axcelis have returned 81.9%, 87% and 48.1%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nKLAC Stock’s Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nKLA Prospect Rides on Strong Advanced Packaging Growth KLA is benefiting from strong demand for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging, which is driving top-line growth. Advanced packaging revenues are expected to grow mid-to-high teens on a year-over-year basis in 2026. Strong investments in WFE and advanced packaging represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. Growth of advanced packaging supporting heterogeneous chip integration has become a new market for KLA, which is currently worth $11 billion and growing faster than core WFE.\n\nKLA’s robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. Process control accelerates time to results by resolving process integration challenges during the fab ramp-up phase to optimize time to market for a diverse mix of semiconductor designs.\n\nMoreover, the growing investment in custom silicon, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of unique device designs. This has put customers under pressure to deliver performance, volume and time to market, resulting in strong demand for advanced process control. This aids KLA’s prospects as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology and yield optimization solutions. This bodes well for KLAC’s top-line growth.\n\nKLAC expects the core WFE market to grow in the high single to low double digits in 2026, reaching the low $120 billion range, up from approximately $110 billion in 2025. The company expects the advanced packaging component of the market to grow at a similar rate to roughly $12 billion for a total market forecast in the mid-$130 billion range, an increase in the low double digits versus its forecast for 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nKLAC’s 2026 Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Positive Trend The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $36.58 per share, up 3% over the past 30 days and indicating 9.9% growth from 2025’s reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $13.39 billion, suggesting 10.1% growth from the 2025’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Corporation Price and Consensus KLA Corporation price-consensus-chart | KLA Corporation Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $9.12 per share, up 2.4% over the past 30 days and indicating 8.4% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $3.37 billion, suggesting 9.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Shares are Trading at a Premium KLAC shares are trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), KLAC is trading at 33.83X, higher than the broader sector and peers. The broader sector is trading at 26.08X while Applied Materials and Axcelis trade at 32.21X and 20.17X, respectively. However, ASML is pricey with a P/E multiple of 41.48.\nKLAC Stock’s Valuation\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnically, KLA is currently trading above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\nKLA Stock Trades Above 50-Day & 200-Day SMAs\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nKLAC Stock is a Buy Now KLA benefits from strong demand for advanced packaging despite increasing lead times and conservative guidance. Robust AI demand bodes well for KLAC’s prospects and justifies a premium valuation.\n\nKLA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which suggests that investors should start accumulating the stock right now as the dip offers a massive opportunity.

      "Content": "Gold.com and Qualcomm have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:55 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nGC=F\n\nGOLD\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Gold.com GOLD as the Bull of the Day and Qualcomm QCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc.&rsquo;s MU .\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\nBull of the Day: A recent pullback in Gold.com stock may be short-lived as gold prices have rebounded to new record highs of over $5,000 per ounce, as shown below, following a sharp pullback to around $4,400 per ounce earlier in the month.\nAmid an unprecedented commodity price boom for various precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s stock has been one of the market&rsquo;s top performers in 2026 so far, soaring nearly +90% through the first two months of the year and recently hitting a 52-week high of $66 a share.\nOffering a fully integrated alternative assets platform, sentiment continues to build for Gold.com&rsquo;s outlook after reporting impressive results for its fiscal second quarter last Thursday and attracting positive attention from analysts in the process.\n\nHeadquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and formerly known as A-Mark Precious Metals, Gold.com provides an array of precious metals, including minted gold bars, silver, platinum, and palladium, along with copper bullion and numismatic coins to wholesale and retail consumers.\nStrong Q2 Results & Strategic Expansion\nEnforcing the narrative that Gold.com is executing well, Q2 sales spiked 136% year over year to a quarterly record of $6.47 billion from $2.74 billion in the comparative quarter. Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nStory Continues\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nBear of the Day: Qualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\nBottom Line\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nAdditional content: Micron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "1 Investment Firm Just Loaded Up on Yeti Shares. Here's why.\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nIDCC\n\nSKWD\n\nACLS\n\nWhat happened According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated Feb. 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners, LLC. increased its position in Yeti by 373,641 shares during the fourth quarter of 2025. The estimated value of the additional shares acquired was $14.37 million, based on the average quarterly closing price. At quarter-end, the total Yeti position was valued at $134.08 million, up approximately $45.76 million from the prior period, reflecting both trading and price movement effects.\nWhat else to know After this buy, Yeti accounted for approximately 4.02% of 13F reportable AUM at the end of December 2025.\nTop holdings after the filing, other than Yeti:\nUNK: FCNCA: $167 million (approximately 5.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.9 million (approximately 4.4% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $133 million (approximately 4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.7 million (approximately 3.8% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SKWD: $123.5 million (approximately 3.7% of AUM)\nAs of Feb. 10, 2026, shares were priced at $47.06, up approximately 30.2% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 by 15.79 percentage points.\n\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nMarket capitalization\n$3.66 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.83 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$160.31 million\nPrice (as of market close February 10, 2026)\n$47.06\n\nCompany snapshot Yeti offers hard and soft coolers, drinkware, bags, outdoor living gear, and accessories primarily under the YETI and Rambler brands.\nThe company generates revenue through direct-to-consumer e-commerce, independent retailers, and international distribution channels.\nIt targets outdoor enthusiasts, recreation consumers, and specialty retail shoppers in the United States and select international markets.\nYeti designs premium coolers and drinkware for outdoor enthusiasts, leveraging a multi-channel strategy to reach a broad consumer base. The company is a leading designer and distributor of premium outdoor products, focusing on durable coolers and innovative drinkware. Its consistent growth reflects strong positioning within the leisure and outdoor recreation market.\n\nWhat this transaction means for investors This new filing comes about one week before Yeti releases fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2025 financial results on Thursday, Feb. 19. Investment firm Reinhart Partners is clearly confident in the business. But interested investors should watch the upcoming report closely.\nThat’s because Yeti’s business has been under pressure recently. Its products are certainly discretionary for consumers who may be looking to tighten their financial spending. That’s not the company’s only issue, either.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter, Yeti’s adjusted earnings per share decreased 14%, even as net sales increased 2%. The company cited the “unfavorable net impact from higher tariff costs in the third quarter” as the reason. Yeti’s international sales actually increased by 14%, while sales in the U.S. declined 1%.\n\nThe company continues to innovate, however. Management is confident enough to increase its share repurchase target to $300 million. Yeti also updated fiscal year guidance slightly to the high end of prior projections for sales and free cash flow.\nYeti is also transforming its supply chain and diversifying its manufacturing footprint to address tariff and supplier issues. That work is likely why Reinhart Partners added more Yeti to the portfolio. The upcoming fourth-quarter report will help investors determine whether tariff and supply chain headwinds are now in the past.\nShould you buy stock in Yeti right now?

      "Content": "1 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Stock to Buy Now With $150\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nInvestors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nAI creates near-term headwinds but long-term tailwinds The growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nStory Continues\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.\n\nShould you buy stock in Qualcomm right now? Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this chip company have returned +15.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Silicon Motion belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +90%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +25.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52.7%. This estimate has changed +21.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.93 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $299.65 million indicates a year-over-year change of +80%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.24 billion and $1.41 billion estimates indicate +39.5% and +14.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $278.46 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +45.7%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $0.91 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $261.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.61%. The EPS surprise was -2.33%.\nOver the last four quarters, Silicon Motion surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "KLA’s Robust Q2 Results and Cash Returns Could Be A Game Changer For KLA (KLAC)\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 10:11 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\nKLA Corporation recently reported past second-quarter fiscal 2026 results showing higher revenue of US$3,297.15 million and net income of US$1,145.68 million year over year, alongside issuing guidance for third-quarter revenue of about US$3.35 billion and GAAP diluted EPS between US$8.07 and US$9.63.\nIn parallel, KLA’s board affirmed a quarterly dividend of US$1.90 per share and the company completed a multi-year share repurchase totaling 18,859,237 shares for US$9.06 billion, underscoring its continued emphasis on returning cash to shareholders while semiconductor demand related to AI investment remains a key theme in its commentary.\nAgainst this backdrop, we will explore how KLA’s strong earnings performance and capital return program shape the company’s broader investment narrative.\n\nCapitalize on the AI infrastructure supercycle with our selection of the 33 best 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush converting record-breaking demand into massive cash flow.\nWhat Is KLA's Investment Narrative? To own KLA, you need to be comfortable tying your fortunes to wafer fab equipment spending and, increasingly, AI-driven capacity investments. The latest quarter’s higher revenue and earnings, coupled with Q3 guidance, reinforce that near term demand remains intact for now, even if that may not materially change the existing catalysts around AI-related tool orders and the broader semiconductor capex cycle. The affirmed US$1.90 dividend and completion of a US$9.06 billion buyback fit neatly into KLA’s pattern of returning substantial cash, but they do not remove the key risks: potential swings in wafer fab budgets, high valuation multiples versus “fair” estimates, and reliance on a few large chip manufacturers. Instead, this news mainly strengthens the sense that management is leaning into the current industry upturn.\n\nHowever, investors should also be aware of how quickly wafer fab spending plans can reset. KLA's shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? Uncover how much higher they are than fair value .\nExploring Other Perspectives The three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$758 to US$1,297 per share, showing how far apart private investors can be. Set against KLA’s strong recent earnings and sizable capital returns, this spread invites you to weigh differing expectations for future AI-driven equipment demand and the risk that spending could cool faster than many anticipate.\nExplore 3 other fair value estimates on KLA - why the stock might be worth as much as $1297!\n\nStory Continues\nBuild Your Own KLA Narrative Disagree with this assessment? Create your own narrative in under 3 minutes - extraordinary investment returns rarely come from following the herd.\nA great starting point for your KLA research is our analysis highlighting 3 key rewards that could impact your investment decision.\nOur free KLA research report provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate KLA's overall financial health at a glance.\nSearching For A Fresh Perspective?

      "Content": "AMAT Climbs 8% in a Month: Time to Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?\n\nSubham Roy\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 8:36 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMAT\n\nLRCX\n\nASML\n\nKLAC\n\nApplied Materials AMAT shares have risen 7.6% in a month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s decline of 1.6% and 0.1%, respectively.\nAMAT One-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe rise in the stock price has made AMAT a premium, as it trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.67, which is above the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s P/S ratio of 8.46.\nAMAT Forward 12-Month Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven AMAT’s stock price rise in the past month and its overvaluation at present, investors might question: Should they buy, hold or sell the stock? Let’s discuss the fundamentals in detail.\nAMAT Gains From Traction Across Its Portfolio AMAT specializes in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Recent launches like Xtera epi, Kinex hybrid bonding, and PROVision 10 eBeam will add to AMAT’s growth story.\nAMAT expects next-generation technologies to be produced in large volume, which means that the company’s customers will be ramping up their foundries, naturally benefiting AMAT’s business. In 2025, AMAT strengthened its leadership in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50%. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\n\nAMAT expects its leading-edge foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory and high bandwidth memory to be the fastest-growing wafer fabrication equipment businesses in 2026. AMAT’s advanced packaging business, which is currently valued at $1.5 billion, is still on track to double to $3 billion over the next few years, driven by HBM demand and next-generation packaging architectures.\nThese factors will contribute to increased traction in Applied Materials’ wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), driven by growing usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing. AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\nAMAT restructured its pricing program, and it is expected to contribute most of the 120-bps gross margin expansion in the coming fiscal year. This cost restructuring will further provide AMAT with enough headroom to ramp up its R&D investments. AMAT is setting up the Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization center for research, which is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nAMAT Navigates Competitive Challenges Applied Materials is winning over its competition like KLA Corporation KLAC, Lam Research LRCX and ASML Holding ASML in the semiconductor supply chain market.\nLam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although they develop solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holdings develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions like Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in GAA transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nWith these factors in place, AMAT’s long-term growth outlook remains strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 revenues are expected to rise 13.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 earnings is expected to grow 22% year over year. AMAT's fiscal 2027 earnings estimates have been revised upward in the past 30 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Buy AMAT Stock for Now The continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging, driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing, is a tailwind for AMAT stock. Considering these long-term growth factors, we suggest investors book this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock at present.

      "Content": "Lam Research Stock's High P/E: Justified Premium or Too Pricey to Buy?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 7:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: LRCX\n\nKLAC\n\nAMAT\n\nONTO\n\nLam Research Corporation LRCX, a leader in semiconductor fabrication equipment, currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38.14, significantly higher than the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry average of 32.\nLRCX’s P/E multiple is also higher than that of some other semiconductor fabrication equipment providers, including KLA Corporation KLAC, Onto Innovation Inc. ONTO and Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT. At present, KLA Corporation, Onto Innovation and Applied Materials have a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 34.16, 33.78 and 31.60, respectively.\n\nLam Research Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLRCX’s lofty valuation multiple is a result of robust appreciation in its share price. In the trailing 12 months, Lam Research shares have soared 174.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 35.1%. It has also outpaced the returns of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation. Shares of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation have rallied 90%, 80.4% and 21.6%, respectively.\n\nLam Research One-Year Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlthough it seems investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock, the billion-dollar question is: Is it justified to overpay?\nIn our opinion, Lam Research’s strong growth prospects amid artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand for advanced nodes justify this premium valuation. The company’s high growth potential in AI and high-performance computing (HPC) markets, along with back-to-back quarters of strong financial performance, suggest that LRCX stock’s upward momentum is far from over.\n\nLam Research’s Resilient Financial Performance Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical issues, and trade and tariff wars, LRCX’s financials remain impressive. In the company’s last reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, total revenues rose 22% year over year to $5.34 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%, primarily driven by continued demand across the Systems and Customer Support Business Group segments.\nLam Research reported second-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.27 per share, which beat the consensus mark by 8.5%. The bottom line also increased 39.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nLam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation Quote\nExpanding its manufacturing operations in Asia has also helped the company lower costs and improve margins. In the second quarter, Lam Research’s non-GAAP operating margin rose to 34.3%, up 360 basis points from the year-ago quarter, which is impressive, considering the challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis strong financial performance reinforces Lam Research’s resilience in navigating an evolving semiconductor cycle. As demand grows for advanced nodes, LRCX’s specialized technology in etch and deposition tools for high-aspect-ratio structures positions it well to capitalize on this trend. The company’s second-quarter results also highlight its effective cost management, which has enabled sustained profitability.\n\nAI-Driven Chip Demand: The Key Catalyst for LRCX’s Growth Lam Research is capitalizing on AI trends. It builds the tools chipmakers need to manufacture next-generation semiconductors, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and chips used in advanced packaging. These technologies are vital for powering AI and cloud data centers.\nLam Research’s products are not only critical but also innovative. For example, its ALTUS ALD tool uses molybdenum to improve speed and efficiency in chip production. Another product, the Aether platform, helps chipmakers achieve higher performance and density. These are essential capabilities as demand for advanced AI chips continues to increase.\n\nIn 2025, Lam Research’s revenues from advanced packaging grew significantly, and management anticipates strong 40% year-over-year growth for 2026. The industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents growth opportunities for LRCX’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.\nThese trends are aiding Lam Research’s financial performance. The company has demonstrated consistent execution, maintaining quarterly revenues of more than $5 billion for the past three consecutive quarters, reflecting solid demand from leading chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung.\nWith AI-driven investments accelerating, Lam Research’s leading position in etch and deposition makes it a key beneficiary of the ongoing semiconductor spending cycle. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenues implies a year-over-year increase of 19.5% and 21.2%, respectively. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings per share indicates growth of 26.1% and 24.4%, respectively.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Buy LRCX Stock Right Now Lam Research’s solid financial performance and strategic focus on AI-driven growth make it a compelling investment option right now despite lofty valuations. The company’s expanding market share in AI and datacenter fabrication, coupled with innovative product launches, strengthens its competitive positioning.\nCurrently, Lam Research sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nSTMicroelectronics introduces the first automotive microcontroller with AI acceleration for edge intelligence\n\nSTMicroelectronics International NV\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 11:00 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: STM\n\nSTMEF\n\nStellar P3E MCUs\nSTMicroelectronics introduces the first automotive microcontroller with AI acceleration for edge intelligence\nStellar P3E automotive microcontroller (MCU) enables real-time AI applications at the edge significantly enhancing vehicle intelligence\nSimplifies multi-function integration for X-in-1 Electronic Control Units\nDelivers flexible, real-time performance for safe, responsive applications from hybrid/EV systems to body zonal architectures\n\nGeneva, February 10, 2026 -- STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) , a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, today announced the Stellar P3E , the first automotive microcontroller (MCU) with built-in AI acceleration for automotive edge intelligence. Designed for future software-defined vehicles, the Stellar P3E simplifies multi-function integration for X-in-1 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that reduce system cost, weight, and complexity.\n“Stellar P3E sets a new benchmark for automotive electrification by combining high-performance real-time control and edge AI in a single device that meets the highest automotive safety levels,” said Luca Rodeschini, Group Vice President and General Purpose and Automotive Microcontrollers Division General Manager, STMicroelectronics. “Its increased processing power, AI acceleration, large and extensible memory, rich analogue content, smart sensing capabilities, and intelligent power management functions support new applications such as virtual sensors. This better enables automakers with the tools to create safer, more efficient and more responsive driving experiences.”\n\nA defining feature of the Stellar P3E is its integrated ST Neural-ART Accelerator™ for real-time AI efficiency —making it the first MCU with an embedded neural network accelerator for the automotive industry. Powered by this dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) with an advanced data-flow architecture for AI workloads, and combined with its rich sensing capabilities, the P3E enables smart sensing that opens the door to new applications such as virtual sensors.\nThe P3E delivers inference processing at microsecond speeds, achieving up to 30x greater efficiency compared to traditional MCU core processors. This enables always-on, low-power artificial intelligence (AI) that can support real-time functions, including predictive maintenance and smart sensing, delivering significant benefits across a wide range of applications. For example, these capabilities can enhance charging speed and efficiency in electric vehicles and enable rapid deployment of new features, whether in the factory or in the field. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can introduce new functions and more intuitive behaviors through different AI models, reducing the need for additional sensors, modules, wiring, and integration effort.\n\nStory Continues\n“Shifting neural processing from centralized hubs to the edge of the vehicle enables sub millisecond-level decision-making, which is essential for the next generation of in-vehicle intelligence. Integrating AI hardware acceleration at the MCU level allows OEMs to deliver advanced capabilities, such as predictive maintenance for vehicle performance and smart sensing with virtual sensor applications. This enables very low latency sensing, actuation control, and other sophisticated features, without the cost and thermal burden of a full-scale SoC,” said Greg Basich, Associate Director, Counterpoint Research.\n\nAs the automotive industry embraces the shift toward software-defined vehicles (SDVs), Stellar P3E’s integrated xMemory, ST’s proprietary non-volatile memory based on phase-change memory (PCM) , provides the essential scalability and flexibility needed. Offering twice the density of traditional embedded flash memory and qualified for automotive environments, this extensible memory solution enables dynamic expansion of software storage to accommodate new features and updates without requiring any hardware redesign.\nThe P3E is fully supported within the ST Edge AI Suite , a comprehensive edge-AI ecosystem that spans from dataset creation to on-device deployment for data scientists and embedded engineers. As part of this suite, NanoEdge AI Studio tool is now available for the entire Stellar MCU family. In addition, the Stellar P3E is already integrated into Stellar Studio , ST’s all-in-one development environment tailored for automotive engineers. Together they reinforce a robust hardware and software ecosystem designed to streamline the deployment of sophisticated edge AI solutions in demanding automotive environments.\n\nThe start of production of the Stellar P3E is planned in the fourth quarter of 2026.\nKey technical highlights :\n500 MHz Arm® Cortex®-R52+ cores delivering the highest CoreMark score in its class - exceeding 8,000 points.\nSplit-lock architecture enabling designers to optimize the balance between functional safety and peak performance.\nOpen Arm architecture, leveraging a vast global developer community for accelerated innovation.\nRich I/O and analog capabilities support diverse functions, including advanced motor control for enhanced vehicle dynamics.\nAbout STMicroelectronics\nAt ST, we are 48,000 creators and makers of semiconductor technologies mastering the semiconductor supply chain with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities.

Davidson分析師Gil Luria出具報告指出，我們認為市場過度反應，股價已經跌過頭。近幾個月來，OpenAI的商業模式已有顯著進步，「OpenAI似乎已經修正策略失誤，並重新聚焦於核心的前沿模型（frontier models），也開始考慮安插廣告的「變現」模式，「我們認為重整後的OpenAI可望重返Google最大挑戰者的位置」。CNBC報導，OpenAI執行長奧特曼（Sam Altman）上周五告知員工和投資人，ChatGPT的月成長率已重返逾10%。他並透露本周將推出升級版的AI聊天機器人模型。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n●Alphabet漲0.45%，收在324.32美元。據外媒報導，Google母公司Alphabet周一成功發行公司債籌資200億美元，規模超出原訂的150億美元。Alphabet此次發債吸引超過1000億美元認購，成為史上企業債發行需求最強勁的交易之一，顯示對於科技巨頭舉債發展AI，市場目前仍然樂意買單。分析師表示，這可能帶動今年企業債發行規模創下歷史新高。\n\n●Waters Corp周一崩跌13.94%，收在328.14美元，在醫療保健成分股中跌幅最大。該實驗室設備製造商第一季獲利預測不如市場預期，此外，投資人也關注去年收購的Becton Dickinson表現疲弱。\n●Hims & Hers Health暴跌16%，為連跌第七天。諾和諾德（Novo Nordisk）以侵犯專利權為由向這家遠距醫療（telehealth）公司提起告訴。此前，在美國食藥管理局（FDA）強烈反對下，Hims & Hers Health在推出僅48小時後後又立即下架一款售價僅49美元的諾和諾德減肥藥Wegovy仿製藥。",

      "Content": "AWS deepens STMicro tie with 24.8 million-share warrant deal\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 1:06 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: STM\n\nAMZN\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAmazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) Web Services appears to be tightening its grip on critical data-center infrastructure by deepening its relationship with STMicroelectronics NV ( NYSE:STM ), as the cloud unit looks to secure a broader range of semiconductor technologies for its hyperscale operations. Under the agreement disclosed on Monday, STMicro will supply AWS with chips supporting high-bandwidth connectivity and energy-efficient power management, components that are increasingly relevant as AI workloads place heavier demands on data-center performance and power efficiency. The structure of the deal suggests AWS is positioning itself not just as a customer, but as a long-term partner as global data-center build-outs accelerate.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAlongside the commercial supply arrangement, AWS received warrants to acquire up to 24.8 million ordinary STMicro shares, with vesting linked to AWS's purchases of STMicro products over time. The warrants can be exercised over a seven-year period at an initial exercise price of $28.38, giving AWS the flexibility to build an equity position in stages. STMicro shares rose 6.5% at the market open to $26.51 following the announcement, while for AWS the move represents at least its second investment in a semiconductor company, reinforcing the view that cloud operators could increasingly blend procurement and capital allocation to secure strategic supply.\n\nThe backdrop to the agreement is a widening semiconductor opportunity driven by AI-related data-center investment, where demand is extending beyond advanced processors into analog chips used for power management, sensing, and cooling. STMicro, which supplies customers such as Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), recently forecast first-quarter revenue that came in above analysts' expectations, with consumer electronics demand showing signs of recovery late last year after a prolonged slump. At the same time, management has cautioned that the rebound remains uneven, with Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery noting that the automotive market is not yet stable, suggesting that AI-driven infrastructure demand could be an important, though not uniform, support for the company's outlook.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AMAT to Post Q1 Earnings: Time to Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?\n\nSubham Roy\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 6:58 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMAT\n\nApplied Materials AMAT is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 12.\nFor the fiscal first quarter, AMAT expects revenues to be $6.85 billion (+/- $500 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.89 billion, suggesting a decline of 3.87% from the year-ago quarter’s reading.\nApplied Materials projects non-GAAP earnings to be $2.18 (+/- $0.20). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.19 per share, indicating a decline of 7.98% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The figure has remained unchanged in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMAT has an impressive earnings surprise history. AMAT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 4.17%.\nApplied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Applied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote\nEarnings Whispers for AMAT Stock Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for AMAT this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($2.26 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.19 per share), is +3.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: AMAT carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\nFactors to Consider for AMAT’s Q1 FY26 AMAT’s wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) is experiencing increased demand due to a rise in the usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing (HPC). In the previous quarter, AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\nAMAT’s flash memory or NAND sales nearly doubled to $1.41 billion in fiscal 2025 from the year-ago sales of $747.4 million. Although AMAT has a lower market share in the NAND space, it is gaining prominence. This trend is likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, supporting AMAT’s top-line growth.\n\nApplied Materials’ leadership in GAA transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips, are likely to have driven AMAT’s semiconductor segment in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nAMAT’s display business has rebounded in the fiscal 2025 with year-over-year growth of 19.8%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the display revenues grew 68.2% year over year as Applied Materials shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly. These factors are likely to have benefited AMAT’s corporate and other segment’s revenues.\n\nThe company’s Applied Global Services segment is also likely to have seen steady growth, aided by strong demand for comprehensive service agreements and the expansion of its subscription-based business.\nApplied Materials’ Price Performance & Valuation Applied Materials shares have gained 74.9% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which has gained 19.4%.\nAMAT 6-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLet us now look at the value Applied Materials offers to its investors at current levels. AMAT is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 8.46X compared with the industry’s 8.26X.\nAMAT Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Thesis on Applied Materials Applied Materials operates in a highly competitive market space where it faces competition from players, including Lam Research LRCX in the semiconductor space, ASML Holding ASML in the photolithography and advanced manufacturing equipment segment. KLA Corporation KLAC is a dominant competitor in the wafer inspection space.\nFor instance, Lam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although developing solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holding develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions, such as Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\n\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nConclusion: Buy AMAT Stock Now AMAT is gaining from continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and HPC. AMAT’s HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology technologies are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Considering these factors, we suggest investors buy this stock now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "Content": "Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 6:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nAMAT\n\nHave you been paying attention to shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS) ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $144.76 in the previous session. Cirrus Logic has gained 20.5% since the start of the year compared to the -0.6% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 3.2% return for the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 3, 2026, Cirrus Logic reported EPS of $2.97 versus consensus estimate of $2.42.\nFor the current fiscal year, Cirrus Logic is expected to post earnings of $8.51 per share on $1.94 in revenues. This represents a 12.86% change in EPS on a 2.35% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.77 per share on $2.03 in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.03% and 4.48%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics Though Cirrus Logic has recently hit a 52-week high, what is next for Cirrus Logic? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). The individual style scores for Value, Growth, Momentum and the combined VGM Score run from A through F. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nCirrus Logic has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 37.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.4X versus its peer group's average of 23.4X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cirrus Logic currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cirrus Logic fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Cirrus Logic shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nStory Continues\nHow Does CRUS Stack Up to the Competition? Shares of CRUS have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) . AMAT has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of D, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of A.\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Applied Materials, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 2.84%, and for the current fiscal year, AMAT is expected to post earnings of $9.62 per share on revenue of $29.17 billion.\n\nShares of Applied Materials, Inc. have gained 7.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 33.53X and a P/CF of 31.95X.\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is in the top 25% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CRUS and AMAT, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's what you need to know today.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nHow will Amazon's deal impact STMicroelectronics?\n\nWhy are Novo Nordisk shares rising today?\n\nWhat's behind Kroger's CEO hiring decision?\n\nWhat drove the Dow above 50,000 for first time?\n\nStock Futures Slip After Friday's Huge Gains Stock futures are down slightly Monday as investors look ahead to a busy week of earnings and economic reports. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were down 0.1% recently, while those linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The major indexes soared on Friday at the end of a volatile week of trading, with the Dow gaining 1,200 points to close above 50,000 for the first time. Bitcoin was at $69,000 this morning, down from a Sunday high of around $72,000 but well up from last week's low of around $60,000 , the cryptocurrency's lowest level since late 2024. Gold futures were recently up 1% at $5,030 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures ticked higher to $63.75 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.24%, up from 4.20% at Friday's close.\n\nBusy Week of Earnings, Economic Data Ahead Investors are preparing for a busy week of earnings reports and the release of economic data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. The earnings calendar includes reports from iconic American brands such as McDonald's ( MCD ), The Coca-Cola Company ( KO ) and Ford Motor ( F ), as well as releases from CVS Health ( CVS ), AstraZeneca ( AZN ), T-Mobile ( TMUS ), Robinhood ( HOOD ), Coinbase ( COIN ), Spotify Technology ( SPOT ) and Airbnb ( ABNB ), among others. The January jobs report is scheduled for release on Wednesday morning, while the Consumer Price Index is due on Friday. The Fed, which has a dual mandate to maintain price stability while promoting maximum employment, will be watching the data closely.\n\nNovo Nordisk Stock Gains as Hims & Hers Pulls Weight-Loss Pill Shares of Novo Nordisk ( NVO ) are rising while Hims & Hers Health ( HIMS ) shares are tumbling following the latest developments in the weight-loss drug wars. Hims & Hers said over the weekend that it will stop offering its compounded semaglutide pill just days after launching the product . The pill was marketed as having the same active ingredient as Novo's Wegovy pill that received FDA approval in December . The FDA said on Friday that it planned to \"take decisive steps to restrict\" the use of GLP-1 active ingredients in compounded versions of the popular weight loss medications, citing Hims & Hers by name in the statement. Novo Nordisk on Monday announced a lawsuit against Hims & Hers, saying it is asking a court to \"permanently ban Hims from selling unapproved, compounded drugs that infringe our patents, and is seeking to recover damages.\" Shares of Novo Nordisk were up more than 5% in recent premarket trading, while Hims shares sank 20% to their lowest levels since September 2024.\n\nStory Continues\nKroger Rises on Naming of New CEO Kroger ( KR ) stock is gaining ground this morning following news the grocery giant has hired former Walmart ( WMT ) executive Greg Foran to be its CEO. The Wall Street Journal had reported on Sunday that the decision had been made and that an announcement was imminent. Foran served as head of Walmart's U.S. business from 2014 to 2019, before spending the next several years leading Air New Zealand as CEO. Kroger has been looking for a new CEO for nearly a year, since previous CEO Rodney McMullen was dismissed in March 2025 over an undisclosed ethics violation. Foran was identified as a potential candidate by Wall Street analysts in the weeks after McMullen was fired, as they said a former Walmart executive could help Kroger compete with the nation's largest retailer. Kroger's move comes at a busy time for executive changes in retail, as Walmart itself and rival Target ( TGT ) each recently welcomed new CEOs . Kroger shares were up 7% recently.\n\nSTMicroelectronics Stock Jumps on Amazon Deal Shares of STMicroelectronics ( STM ) are surging after the European chipmaker announced a new deal with Amazon ( AMZN ). The company said Monday that it has agreed to a \"multi-year, multi-billion\" dollar deal to supply Amazon Web Services with a range of semiconductors. The chipmaker also said it has issued warrants that would allow Amazon to acquire up to 24.8 million shares in the company over the next several years as part of the deal. Amazon and other tech giants have laid out plans in recent weeks to substantially increase their spending on artificial intelligence projects this year, including building data centers and buying the equipment to run them. Amazon said last week its capital expenditures could reach up to $200 billion this year. U.S.-traded shares of STMicroelectronics were up 7% recently. Amazon stock was little changed after tumbling Friday following the company's announcement of the big spending plans and a weaker-than-expected earnings report.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
