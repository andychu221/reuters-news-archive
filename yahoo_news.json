      "Content": "Even when stocks are on strong runs, it can still be a good time to add to positions if their prospects are bright and valuations remain attractive. Let's look at two growth stocks trading at reasonable valuations to double up on.\n\nDespite its price more than doubling this year, shares of Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) are still cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15 times analyst estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) and below 8 times fiscal 2027 estimates. Meanwhile, the company is in the midst of a flash (NAND) memory supercycle that shows no signs of letting up.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nJust a few years ago, the NAND market was in shambles, with memory companies having too much supply after a surge in demand for electronics during the COVID-19 pandemic led them to increase production. When that pull forward in demand disappeared, the market became oversupplied, and memory makers had to sell inventory below the cost of making flash memory. This led the big memory makers to significantly slash production and turn their focus to DRAM (dynamic random access memory).\n\nMeanwhile, a special form of DRAM called high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with strong unit economics emerged for use in artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, leading NAND to be an afterthought.\n\nHowever, AI data centers soon needed massive, high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs) that use flash memory to store data, leading to a surge in demand for NAND shortly after production lines were cut and the focus turned to HBM. This has led to surging NAND prices, which are now propelling Sandisk's sales and gross margins. And with other memory makers now focused on HBM and unlikely to shift production back to NAND, as a pure-play flash memory maker, Sandisk should enjoy many years of strong revenue growth and high margins, giving the stock plenty of upside from here.\n\nWhile Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is trading near all-time highs, the stock is still attractively valued, with a forward P/E of around 26 times. That's a great value for a company at the heart of the AI infrastructure boom that is growing quickly.\n\nTSMC is the world's largest foundry, and as the only chip manufacturer that has proven it can make advanced logic chips at scale, like graphics processing units (GPUs), with few defects, it has become an integral partner to chip designers. The company has a near monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing, which has also given it tremendous pricing power. Given the surging demand for AI chips, TSMC is in a strong position moving forward.\n\nTSMC sees its AI chip revenue climbing at a more 50% annual rate through 2029, making the stock a solid buy, despite it trading near its all-time highs.",

They offer low expense ratios and comparable one-year returns. Deciding between them comes down to the individual investor’s goals for their portfolio.\n\nIEFA is for those wanting lower risk and volatility due to its focus on developed markets outside North America, and large number of holdings at over 2,500 stocks. Its lower five-year drawdown illustrates this point. The ETF also offers a higher dividend yield for income-oriented investors, and far greater liquidity thanks to its large AUM.\n\nSCHE is for aggressive investors seeking growth. Its larger tilt towards technology stocks compared to IEFA means it has a greater potential to capitalize on the advent of artificial intelligence. However, because it targets emerging markets, SCHE is exposed to greater volatility and political risks.\n\nFor long-term investors who prioritize stability and income, IEFA is the better choice. For those who want to emphasize growth stocks, SCHE is the way to go.",

      "Content": "Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) remains one of my favorite EV stocks . This year alone should prove very exciting for the company. In fact, some major milestones could be reached within a matter of weeks. Longer term, there's a good chance that Rivian gives rival Tesla a run for its money in some categories like self-driving technology and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhere will Rivian be three years from now? Investors should be monitoring two primary storylines.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nWhat made Tesla the $1.3 trillion giant it is today? There were many pivotal milestones over the decades, but the release of the Model 3 and Model Y -- Tesla's first affordable vehicles priced under $50,000 -- tops my list.\n\nNearly 70% of Americans want their next vehicle purchase to be under $50,000. Getting a true EV to market under this price point is very challenging. Only a handful of manufacturers have been able to accomplish this due to the sheer scale required.\n\nWhen Tesla released its affordable models, growth exploded. Today, those two vehicles account for more than 90% of its vehicle sales.\n\nThus far, Rivian hasn't been able to compete directly with Tesla in the lucrative category of \"mass market\" vehicles -- that is, vehicles priced for mass consumption. That should all change early this year when its R2 model begins shipping. Priced under $50,000, the R2 will be the first of three new vehicles Rivian intends to launch in 2026 and 2027. All will be priced under the critical $50,000 threshold.\n\nTesla's mass-market models proved pivotal to its growth story. Rivian's R2 model, as well as its upcoming R3 and R3X models, could prove similarly pivotal over the next three years.\n\nIf cars and trucks are the hardware of transportation, AI may soon prove to be the enabling software. For decades, EV leaders like Elon Musk have promised fully autonomous, self-driving vehicles. That reality has persistently been on the horizon.\n\nAI, however, could change everything. The acceleration of AI technologies has dramatically improved self-driving technologies over a short period of time. Many experts now believe full autonomy is closer than ever.\n\nIf a carmaker wants to sell vehicles in the future, it will have to market both the hardware and its software. Self-driving technologies, driven by advancements in AI, will be key to selling vehicles within the next three years.\n\nTesla has invested billions into its own AI efforts. In second place, despite its steep capital disadvantage, is Rivian. The company has made several key AI announcements in recent months, putting its own AI platform at the center of its growth strategy.\n\nThere's still a lot to learn about its efforts, but Rivian appears to be betting its capital on the right growth drivers. As AI and autonomy grow in importance over the coming years, expect Rivian to keep pace with Tesla better than nearly any other EV stock.",

      "Content": "After performing well for the first six months or so of 2025, shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) started moving in the wrong direction in the second half of the year. And the company has shown no signs of a rebound so far in 2026. Microsoft's shares are down by 22% over the past six months.\n\nShould investors consider purchasing the stock now, or will the company remain southbound for the foreseeable future? Let's find out.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe company's financial results haven't been bad. In the second quarter of its fiscal 2026, ended on Dec. 31, revenue increased by 17% year over year to $81.3 billion. Microsoft's cloud business remains the star of the show. Azure revenue climbed 39%, well ahead of the overall business. Adjusted earnings per share were up 24% to $4.14. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, management is spending a lot to fuel its cloud and artificial intelligence ambitions. The company's capital expenditures (capex) for the period were $37.5 billion, up almost 66% year over year. But Azure growth seems to be stabilizing, and the company's 2026 third-quarter guidance provides further evidence of that, with a projected increase of 37% to 38% (in constant currency).\n\nThe problem isn't that Microsoft isn't performing well. It's that the high growth driven by Azure (given its capex spending) was already baked into the stock price, so anything that looks \"average\" by the company's lofty standards simply isn't good enough. The market wanted to see accelerating growth. That's one of the biggest reasons the stock has been moving in the wrong direction.\n\nThe poor performance over the past six months has made the stock much more reasonably valued. The company is currently trading at 24.7 times forward earnings, which is very reasonable compared to its peers in the \" Magnificent Seven \" -- and for that matter, versus the industry average of 24.5.\n\nEven with slowing growth, Microsoft remains one of the leaders in cloud computing and AI, thanks to its deep enterprise relationships and its partnership with OpenAI, a market leader. The company also benefits from a strong competitive advantage from switching costs.\n\nAnd even if the stock is due for a sell-off, given stabilizing growth in its Azure division, Microsoft looks very attractive to long-term investors at current levels.\n\nCan capex cause a problem down the line? Potentially, but the company has shown that it can pivot quickly and cut costs if its ambitions fail to materialize, as it did a few years ago, notably by cutting jobs, among other things. So, Microsoft is a buy at current levels, at least for investors wanting to hold the stock for the next five years and beyond.",

      "Content": "As investors cheer the S&P 500 's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) ascent to historic highs, Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund, has some concerns. In a recent interview, the billionaire flagged a growing \"bearish force\" that he believes could have a profound impact on the market in the near future.\n\nThis comes just as an important gauge of how richly valued the stock market is hits levels only seen in the lead-up to the dotcom crash. Here's what investors need to know.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nAt the heart of Ray Dalio's argument is what he calls a looming \"capital war.\" Unlike a trade war fought with tariffs on goods, a capital war weaponizes money itself through sanctions, asset freezes, and capital controls. Dalio believes rising geopolitical tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, are pushing the world in this direction, undermining the free flow of capital we've grown accustomed to having.\n\nThe U.S. government runs large deficits each year and borrows money to cover the gap by selling Treasury bonds. Traditionally, foreign buyers purchased a significant portion of these bonds. But as tensions rise, these buyers are growing cautious, fearing their assets could one day be sanctioned or frozen. This reduced demand creates a dilemma, and the government faces two choices:\n\nHigher yields: The government offer higher interest rates on bonds to make them more attractive. This ripples through the entire economy, making borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers alike, which slows economic growth.\n\nCurrency \"debasement\": The government can print more money to purchase its own debt. This erodes the dollar's real value over time via the basic law of supply and demand -- more dollars for the same demand.\n\nGovernments are forced into a corner where they must choose the lesser of two evils -- or most likely, some painful combination of both. While some of this is already present, Dalio sees the potential for something much more stark -- and much more impactful for the stock market.\n\nThe cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio is a valuation metric that compares stock prices to average earnings over the past 10 years, adjusted for inflation. Think of it as a smoothed-out, birds-eye-view version of a traditional P/E ratio.\n\nIt's not a perfect metric -- none are -- but it is a useful gauge to compare today's market to the past. By adjusting for inflation and averaging earnings over a long period, it eliminates some of the short-term \"noise\" and helps make historical comparisons as apples to apples as can be.\n\nSo it's no wonder that many investors are nervous to see the S&P 500's CAPE ratio at historic highs, just shy of 40. The only time it has exceeded this, as you can see in the chart below, was in 1999.\n\nNow, as I said, it's not a perfect metric. It's easy to take it as confirmation that we are in a bubble, but that would be a mistake. No single metric or data point can tell you that, but it's concerning nonetheless -- especially when you take into account that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom fueling these rich valuations is heavily reliant on capital continuing to flow freely -- and debt to remain relatively cheap. If Dalio's warnings prove true, the boom could turn to bust.\n\nSo what should investors do? If you're holding stocks that depend heavily on debt to fuel their growth, ask yourself what will happen if that funding slows down or dries up. It also wouldn't be a bad idea to have some cash on the sidelines to take advantage of a potential downturn.\n\nBut most of all, focus on investing in high-conviction stocks with strong competitive advantages and healthy cash flows -- companies that can fund their growth from operations rather than borrowed money. These are the kinds of stocks that can weather storms and keep compounding your wealth over decades.\n\nPlaying the long game has always been the best approach.",

      "Content": "If you're looking for high-yield stocks with growing dividend payouts, there is no better place to look than the energy midstream space. Let's look at two pipeline master limited partnerships (MLPs) you can buy and hold for the long term.\n\nEnergy Transfer (NYSE: ET) offers investors an intriguing combination of a high-yield stock and strong growth potential. The company recently increased its distribution, raising it by more than 3% year over year to an annual payout of $1.34. That gives the stock about a 7.4% forward yield.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nEnergy Transfer's distribution is well covered by its distributable cash flow ( operating cash flow minus maintenance capex), with the company having a 1.7 times coverage ratio last quarter (the third quarter). It has also nicely improved its balance sheet, and it has said it has the highest percentage of take-or-pay contracts in its history, giving it strong visibility.\n\nEnergy Transfer's strong position in the Permian Basin, which is a low-cost source of natural gas, is presenting it with robust growth project opportunities stemming from the artificial intelligence (AI) data center buildout. It has already announced plans to spend up to $5.5 billion in growth capex this year to help capture the attractive growth opportunities in front of it. Meanwhile, it plans to continue increasing its distribution by 3% to 5% a year moving forward.\n\nThere has been no company as consistent in the midstream space as Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) . The MLP increased its distribution for the 27th straight year in 2025. This is a remarkable streak, given that this stretch includes various periods of tough economic and energy conditions. The stock currently yields about 6.3%, and the company has been growing its payout at about a 3% annual clip. Its distribution is also well supported, with a coverage ratio of 1.8 times in the fourth quarter.\n\nUnlike Energy Transfer, Enterprise will actually ramp down its growth capex this year, taking it to a range of $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion, from $4.4 billion in 2025. This will lead to the company having a lot of discretionary cash flow (free cash flow after paying distributions) that it can then use to pay down debt, buy back stock, or make acquisitions. While it expects modest growth this year, it is looking for its adjusted EBITDA and cash flow to grow by double digits in 2027 as new projects ramp up.\n\nAs a sleep-well-at-night stock with solid future growth prospects, Enterprise is a high-yield dividend stock to own for the long haul.",

The company experienced remarkable growth across all its business segments.\n\nThis explains why its revenue was up by 61% year over year in fiscal 2026's second quarter (which ended on Jan. 2) to just over $3 billion. More importantly, its earnings increased by just over 5x. The stunning growth in Sandisk's earnings is the result of a severe supply shortage in the NAND flash industry.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data centers have been consuming a significant chunk of flash storage supply to store massive datasets to support artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. At the same time, the average storage in generative AI-capable smartphones and PCs is rising. As a result, flash memory manufacturers, such as Sandisk, aren't able to produce enough chips to satisfy end-market demand.\n\nThe supply shortage has led to an astronomical increase in flash storage prices. Sandisk pointed out in its January earnings call that its fabrication plants are running at full capacity. However, the demand for memory chips is so strong that hyperscalers are willing to pay a significant premium to secure more storage capacity.\n\nThat's probably the reason why Sandisk will reportedly double the price of its enterprise-focused 3D NAND solid-state drives in the current quarter. Given that the 2026 NAND flash manufacturing capacity is reportedly sold out, there is a strong possibility of prices rising further. So, it is easy to see why the midpoint of Sandisk's fiscal Q3 earnings guidance of $13 per share would be a vast improvement over the year-ago loss of $0.30 per share.\n\nAnalysts expect Sandisk's earnings to jump to $39.45 in the current fiscal year from $2.99 per share in the previous one. The company is anticipated to sustain impressive momentum in the next fiscal year as well.\n\nSandisk has already delivered $7.55 per share in earnings in the first half of the current fiscal year. The consensus estimate for fiscal 2026 suggests that it could deliver another $31.90 per share in earnings in the second half of the fiscal year (which will end in June).\n\nAssuming Sandisk registers half of its $73.69 earnings per share target for fiscal 2027 in the first half of the next fiscal year (which will end in December 2026), its calendar 2026 earnings could land at $70.07 per share.\n\nSandisk is currently trading at just 15 times forward earnings, a significant discount to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 24.7. Even if it trades at 20 times earnings at the end of the year due to its accelerating growth, its stock price could jump to $1,401 (based on the $70.07-per-share earnings estimate).\n\nThe multiple assumed is lower than the Nasdaq-100 index's forward price-to-earnings ratio (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). The price target mentioned points to a 158% jump from current levels, though don't be surprised if it jumps higher if the market rewards it with a premium valuation.\n\nSo, investors looking to buy an AI stock that's growing at a phenomenal pace and trades at an attractive valuation can still buy Sandisk, as its remarkable rally is here to stay in 2026.",

Since the start of 2025, it's up around 71%, but right now it's down around 22% from its all-time high set in late October 2025.\n\nWhile AMD's artificial intelligence (AI) offerings have improved, the reality is that it's still behind Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and with other computing options launching from Broadcom , AMD's odds of turning its stock price performance around are getting worse.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nManagement remains optimistic that AMD will succeed over the next five years, and some solid signs could ignite a huge rally. AMD's stock could go in a lot of different directions, but which path is the most appropriate one to take for long-term investors right now?\n\nManagement is very bullish on its five-year prospects. In November, management offered guidance for a 60% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in its data center division -- the division that's most exposed to all the AI spending that's going on. With capital expenditure plans now revealed by several AI hyperscalers, and with just Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet committed to spending over $500 billion in capital expenditures during 2026, there is plenty of potential revenue to capture.\n\nAMD hasn't historically been a major player in the AI realm, and its equipment has mostly been viewed as an alternative to Nvidia's offerings. If AMD can change that view, success should follow. AMD's projected 60% CAGR alone should boost the stock over the next five years.\n\nIn AMD's fourth-quarter results, progress was seen toward hitting the 60% CAGR goal, but AMD is still a long way away from achieving it. In Q4, AMD's data center segment increased its revenue 39% year over year. That's not 60% as forecast, but it's a large improvement over the third quarter's 22% growth. Investors need to see a few more quarters of improving results before they should be convinced that AMD's turnaround is real. That suggests holding on to the stock seems like a good idea, rather than scooping up more.\n\nEven if AMD turns it around, why would investors want to own AMD over Nvidia? It's far easier to invest in companies that are already excelling, and Nvidia is doing just that. It's growing its AI businesses at a much faster rate than AMD, and the stock also trades for a lower valuation.\n\nAt 24 times forward earnings, Nvidia looks like a bargain compared to AMD, and you don't have to wait for a turnaround to occur -- it's excelling right now.\n\nOf all three arguments, I fall somewhere between the hold and sell camps. I think AMD could turn it around, but I need to see evidence that it's occurring. Even if it does turn it around, Nvidia is a much stronger company, and it makes more sense to invest in it.",

      "Content": "Given the stock's sizable price drop immediately following the announcement, it's clear that most investors aren't big fans of Amazon 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) 2026 spending plans. The e-commerce giant said it plans to earmark $200 billion for capital expenditures, most of which will be allocated to Amazon Web Services, where the company's artificial intelligence (AI) business operates. For perspective on this figure, for the entirety of 2025, Amazon turned $717 billion into net income of $77.7 billion.\n\nGiven this swell of impending outlays , shareholders' concerns are easy to understand. Just bear in mind there may be an even higher cost in not making this investment.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe kicker: Amazon is one of the few players in the AI data center space that's actually achieving a respectable return on the money being invested in this infrastructure.\n\nCutting straight to the chase, Amazon can't afford not to make this big investment in its cloud computing arm.\n\nAs the graphic below illustrates, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to lose market share -- as measured by revenue -- to cloud computing rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Indeed, as of last quarter, AWS' share of the global business continued to deteriorate to a multiyear low of 28%.\n\nThis doesn't mean Amazon is moving backwards on this front, to be clear. AWS' revenue improved nearly 24% year over year last quarter, inflating its operating income to the tune of 17%. It's growing less than its top two competitors are, though, while its profit margins are shrinking. This isn't a tenable trend investors are apt to tolerate for long. Something's going to have to change sooner than later. New-and-improved AI offerings are the company's best bet at winning back some of its recently lost cloud market share.\n\nHere's the thing: Largely unlike Apple , Oracle , and the aforementioned Microsoft, investors have already seen Amazon achieve relatively quick and respectable returns on its investments in new artificial intelligence technology.\n\nTake its self-developed Trainium and Inferentia series of AI processing chips as an example. They're performance-competitive with Nvidia 's hardware at a fraction of the price.\n\nMeanwhile, so-called Amazon Bedrock makes it easier for the company's cloud customers to build their own generative AI apps, including AI-powered customer service agents. Although Amazon generally doesn't offer much detail about such individual initiatives, CEO Andy Jassy did disclose during the recent fourth-quarter earnings conference call that \"Bedrock is now a multibillion-dollar annualized run rate business, and customer spend grew 60% quarter over quarter.\"\n\nThe point is, while Amazon's current shareholders would certainly prefer the company not spend this much money on anything , it's not likely to be a bad investment. It will position the company to win at least its fair share of the AI data center market that Global Market Insights expects to grow at an average annualized pace of 35.5% through 2034. These capital expenditures may crimp profit margins, but that's a much better alternative than not keeping up with rivals' revenue growth.",

If you aren't an investor, it's really none of your business anyway.\n\nStill, it's fair to wonder why Tesla investors don't insist on more specificity from their leader.\n\nMusk tends to give very mundane answers when asked about what's going on with the company currently, but he really shines when the topic turns to the distant future. That's when he gets to make his bold predictions.\n\nTake Tesla's most recent earnings call , for example.\n\nElon announced that Tesla is updating its mission to \"amazing abundance\" to prepare for the AI-induced utopia he envisions.\n\n\"We're going to keep improving safety, driving down the cost of goods, and getting people access to anything they need, without compromise,\" Musk said. \"And still making sure that the environment is great, nature is great, and people can have whatever they want.\"\n\nIt sounds almost too good to be true. And while it would be easy to dismiss this vision as the dreams of an optimist, if you are a Tesla owner, it may worry you that the company's mission is now serving that future.\n\nAutonomous driving is Tesla's future, perhaps even more so than Musk's future Garden of Eden. But the company's grasp of reality here also seems faulty.\n\nAshok Elluswamy was the first engineer hired to Tesla's AI team in 2014; today, he is the company's vice president of AI software.",

      "Content": "The global automotive industry is driving toward a future of electrification -- it's just a question of the pace at which each automaker is moving. China, for example, is far ahead in electric vehicle (EV) development and infrastructure, and its new-vehicle market is roughly 50% new-energy vehicles.\n\nMany investors think of automakers such as Tesla and BYD when considering EV stocks, but the best opportunity in EV stocks right now might be the automaker you least expect: racing juggernaut Ferrari (NYSE: RACE) . Here's why.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nFew investors think of Ferrari as an EV stock , but that's a huge mistake. In fact, perceptive investors could have noticed the change in the automaker's mix of sales over the last few years.\n\nBack in 2022, Ferrari's shipments were 78% internal combustion engine and 22% hybrids. Fast-forward to the first six months of 2025 and the breakdown for Ferrari shipments is around 55% internal combusion engine and 45% hybrid. While full-electric vehicles are still far less profitable compared to their gasoline counterparts, Ferrari's surge in hybrids hasn't slowed down its margin gains over recent years.\n\nRACE Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nNot only is Ferrari quickly accelerating its hybrid shipments, and doing so with increasing profitability, the company is calculating when might be the right time to debut its first full-electric vehicle. The long-awaited EV from Ferrari is called the Elettrica. Whether investors like it or not, it will be pivotal in deciding Ferrari's pace diving into the future of EVs. Entering the full-EV market too quickly makes it expensive to readjust later, as automakers are finding out, while being too late could be costly by missing out on building its future cadre of enthusiasts.\n\n\"Luxury EVs are still a young and immature category,\" says Brian Lum, an investment manager at Baillie Gifford, according to Barron's . \"It's important to build that next generation of Ferraristi, and electrification should help them to do that.\"\n\nFerrari as an automaker is uniquely positioned with ferocious demand for its products, a line of previous customers waiting for the next supercar to hit the market, margins that competitors can only dream of generating, and a racing heritage that can power its brand to heights few attain. All of these positives come at a cost, and that cost is a premium price for its stock compared to mainstream autos .\n\nHowever, Ferrari has given investors a slight opportunity in recent months to take advantage of an unusually low price-to-earnings valuation for the stock, which declined following the company's guidance that left analysts wanting more, perhaps forgetting that Ferrari often lowballs its guidance to handily beat it later. For investors, Ferrari might not be the first place you look for top EV stocks -- but maybe it should be.\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Stock market crashes rattle most investors, as they are the ultimate tests of patience and willpower. Some people abandon high-quality companies if they drop by 10%, only to regret that decision when those same corporations reclaim all-time highs.\n\nThis powerhouse growth stock has outperformed the S&P 500 for several years, and recent tailwinds suggest it should continue to thrive. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is an attractive buy on any dip, especially during a market crash, since AI chips aren't going anywhere.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nBroadcom is one of the AI chipmakers that tech giants have turned to for their AI plans. Autonomous vehicles, humanoid robots, and AI models like ChatGPT are some of the products and services that rely on semiconductors.\n\nWhile Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has the largest market share, Broadcom specializes in ASIC chips, which are customized for each customer. This customization sets Broadcom apart from Nvidia and other graphics processing unit (GPU) chipmakers. Although Nvidia offers some ASIC chips, those chips are Broadcom's entire business, making it the go-to choice for customized chips.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom compete, but they sell similar products instead of identical ones. On the other hand, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) competes directly with Nvidia, since it mostly makes GPUs. Broadcom doesn't face as much competition in ASIC chips, which explains why the company feels so optimistic about future results.\n\nBroadcom CEO Tan Hock told investors that AI semiconductor revenue should double year over year in the first quarter to $8.2 billion. That's more than 40% of the company's projected Q1 2026 revenue.\n\nA central thesis of the AI boom is that technology companies will continue to increase their AI expenditures each year. This technology has helped companies deliver higher revenue and profits, so there is a return on investment. Big tech has committed roughly $650 billion toward AI investments in 2026, and every tech company has increased its annual spending.\n\nMany tech CEOs see this technology as revolutionary and aren't afraid to commit significant capital to it. These same leaders have seen the benefits of being a first mover. Google became the world's leading search engine in large part due to its early entry into the industry. Facebook became the top social network because it was one of the first options. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) gobbled up e-commerce market share by being the first of its kind.\n\nThose types of opportunities exist in AI, and the tech giants know it. They aren't afraid to invest significant capital in the industry. As revenue and profits continue to grow, it will further support each tech leader's ability to invest more in AI infrastructure, such as Broadcom's ASIC chips.",

But over the last five years, it has severely underperformed the S&P 500 index, with shares up just 26.3% vs. over 90% returns for the broad market index.\n\nThe stock fell yet again after reporting fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 5, trading around $200 for the first time since the April 2025 tariff tantrum. Wall Street seemed disappointed by the earnings report, but I think they are focusing too much on short-term noise and underestimating the technology giant's long-term growth potential.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nHere's why this recent stock drop will help fuel further gains for Amazon shareholders through 2026 and beyond.\n\nInvestors are focused on artificial intelligence (AI) right now, but Amazon still has another gigantic business with its e-commerce and retail operations. North American sales grew 10% year over year last quarter, reaching $426 billion for all of 2025.\n\nMore importantly, profit margins for North American commerce have steadily expanded, reaching a record 9% last quarter and 6.9% for 2025. Fast growth in high-margin advertising and subscription services has led Amazon's North American retail business to grow to close to $30 billion in operating earnings last year.\n\nWith steady growth and continued margin expansion, earnings should grow even more strongly in 2026 and beyond. For example, a 10% operating margin on $500 billion in revenue equals $50 billion in operating income, which is well within reach within the next two to three years.\n\nAmazon's fastest-growing segment is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud infrastructure business. AI spending is helping the entire segment see accelerating revenue growth, which should continue in 2026.\n\nManagement plans to spend $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, primarily on AWS investments. This is going to hurt short-term free-cash-flow generation but will lead to sustained revenue growth for AWS over the next few years.\n\nAWS revenue grew 24% year over year last quarter. Total sales were $129 billion in 2025. If 24% revenue growth can be maintained over the next three years -- as these huge capital investments suggest will happen -- then AWS revenue will grow to close to $250 billion. With segment profit margins sustainably over 30%, this would yield $75 billion in operating earnings from AWS alone.\n\nInvestors are worried about short-term cash-flow hits and Amazon's ability to keep investing in AI growth. However, this is missing the big picture and its profit-generating potential over the next three years.\n\nIf AWS can grow to this $75 billion earnings figure while North American retail grows to $50 billion, that is $125 billion in combined operating earnings. Sprinkle in some earnings from the international retail business -- which now has over $150 billion in revenue -- and consolidated earnings may reach $150 billion in the next few years.\n\nToday, Amazon has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, which would give it an earnings ratio of under 15 based on these earnings estimates. This makes Amazon stock cheap today and a nice buy for investors through 2026 and beyond.",

      "Content": "Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) has been in red-hot form on the stock market in recent months, with shares of the memory specialist jumping by an incredible 222% in the last six months alone.\n\nInvestors have been piling into Micron stock to capitalize on the supply-constrained memory market, where demand for both compute and storage chips is skyrocketing to support artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the cloud. There is a strong possibility that Micron's red-hot run will continue, especially given that the memory shortage is expected to persist until at least 2028, according to industry watchers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nBut what if I told you there's another memory industry participant growing faster than Micron and trading at an almost identical valuation? Let's take a closer look at this name and check why it may turn out to be a better AI stock to buy.\n\nSandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) stock has jumped by an eye-popping 1,220% in the past six months, significantly outpacing Micron's terrific gains. Sandisk's outperformance can be justified by the larger earnings jumps the company has seen in recent quarters.\n\nWhile Micron reported a year-over-year increase of 167% in its non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on Nov. 27, 2025), Sandisk's adjusted earnings shot up by 404% in the fiscal second quarter that ended on Jan. 2, 2026. What's more, analysts expect a 13-fold increase in Sandisk's earnings in the current fiscal year, significantly higher than the fourfold earnings increase that Micron is estimated to deliver.\n\nYou may be wondering why Sandisk is growing much faster than Micron, even though both companies operate in the same industry. While Micron is predominantly a manufacturer of compute-oriented dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips that temporarily store information needed for processing at a given time, Sandisk manufactures non-volatile flash storage chips that store data without requiring a power source.\n\nMicron got nearly 80% of its revenue from the DRAM segment in the previous quarter, while Sandisk is a pure-play flash storage company. This is precisely why Sandisk is outpacing Micron, as NAND flash storage prices are increasing much faster than DRAM prices. Market research firm TrendForce estimates that DRAM prices could rise by 50% to 55% in the current quarter, while the prices of the solid-state drives (SSDs) that Sandisk manufactures are increasing by well into the triple digits, as reported by Tom's Hardware.\n\nWith the SSD shortage expected to continue into next year, Sandisk is likely to continue enjoying healthy earnings growth.\n\nMicron's and Sandisk's sales and earnings multiples are quite close to each other.\n\nThe incredible growth that Sandisk delivers makes it a better value pick over Micron. Of course, an investment in Micron stock is likely to reap rich rewards as well, but if you had to choose only one of these two AI stocks for your portfolio right now, Sandisk looks like the better candidate.",

      "Content": "Micron says AI-driven memory demand continues to outstrip supply through 2026 , with lean DRAM inventories and customers only meeting a fraction of their needs, keeping industry conditions tight.\n\nThe company is expanding capacity via node transitions and greenfield projects — notably the 1-gamma DRAM ramp, Idaho One (mid‑2027) , the Tongluo site (closing expected Q2, supply late‑2027/2028) and a new Singapore NAND fab (first wafer H2 2028) — meaning supply constraints could extend into 2028.\n\nMicron reports HBM4 is in high‑volume production with customer shipments underway, yields on track, and calendar Q1 shipments ramping earlier than previously guided, while 2026 HBM capacity is already sold out.\n\nInterested in Micron Technology, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nThese 3 Stocks Just Saw Major Insider Moves—Time to Be Bullish or Bearish?\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) executives told investors at Wolfe’s Auto, Auto Tech, and Semiconductor Conference that business conditions have strengthened since the company’s most recent earnings call, with demand continuing to outstrip supply across memory markets and tight industry conditions expected to persist beyond 2026.\n\nChief Financial Officer Mark Murphy, joined by Head of Investor Relations Satya Kumar, said Micron is seeing “significantly higher” demand than it—or the industry—can supply. Murphy added that the company is working to expand capacity through a combination of node transitions and greenfield investments, while also progressing on multi-year supply agreements with customers seeking longer-term visibility and assurance.\n\n→ Is Albemarle Setting Up for a Lithium-Fueled Rebound?\n\nMicron: Accelerating HBM Ramp Extends Growth Into 2027\n\nMurphy said demand is being driven by AI systems that require “more and better memory” as models grow larger, context windows extend, and reasoning becomes more intense. He described increasing “tokens generated” and a broader “re-architecture of memory systems” that is pushing high-performance memory deeper into system architectures.\n\nHe pointed to improving server demand trends through 2025, noting that expectations moved from single-digit growth to the “mid-teens” as AI workloads expanded and began affecting even traditional server demand. Murphy also cited rising hyperscaler capital spending, saying expectations for 2026 are “close to $800 billion,” compared with “under $200 billion” a few years ago.\n\n→ Cisco Systems Below $82? Buy Now, It Won’t Last—$182 Is Coming\n\n5 Stocks Wall Street Repriced Higher Heading Into 2026\n\nWhile data center remains the primary driver, Murphy said demand is expected to proliferate to the edge over time, including smartphones and PCs, and eventually areas tied to autonomy-related activities.\n\nOn supply, Murphy said Micron’s inventories are lean—particularly in DRAM—and the company is “sweating the assets” to produce incremental bits where possible. Even so, he emphasized that supply is not meeting demand “by a substantial margin.” He referenced comments from Micron’s CEO on a prior earnings call that some key customers were only able to meet 50% to two-thirds of their demand, underscoring how widespread the shortfall is.\n\n→ Amazon Bets Big on BETA: Why Analysts See 50% Upside\n\nMurphy outlined several steps underway to expand capacity over time:\n\nNode transition: The company is ramping its 1-gamma DRAM node, which Murphy said will provide supply into calendar 2026 and is expected to represent the majority of Micron’s bits in the second half of calendar 2026.\n\nIdaho One: Incremental greenfield capacity is expected to come online in “mid-2027.”\n\nTongluo, Taiwan acquisition: Micron announced an acquisition of a site in Tongluo to support DRAM production. Murphy said the transaction is expected to close in calendar Q2 and that the fab could provide supply near the end of 2027 into 2028. He also said the acquisition price disclosed in the press release was $1.8 billion and that the deal, along with tool installation and related spending, will add to capital expenditures.\n\nSingapore NAND fab: Micron broke ground on a new NAND fab in Singapore, with “first wafer out” expected in the second half of 2028.\n\nMurphy said supply additions take time, particularly for greenfield capacity. He also noted that node transitions are “less efficient than it used to be,” limiting how much incremental supply the industry can generate without building new facilities.\n\nAnother factor pressuring supply, Murphy said, is the increasing silicon intensity of high-bandwidth memory (HBM). He described a trade ratio that has historically been around 3-to-1 for HBM3 and said it increases as the industry moves to HBM4, HBM4E, and HBM5, further tightening supply.\n\nMurphy also addressed what he described as “recent inaccurate reporting” about Micron’s HBM4 position. He said Micron is in high-volume production of HBM4, has commenced customer shipments, and expects shipment volumes to ramp successfully in calendar Q1—one quarter earlier than the company had mentioned on its December earnings call.\n\nMurphy said Micron’s HBM capacity ramp is progressing and reiterated that the company has sold out its calendar year 2026 HBM supply. He added that HBM yields, including HBM4 yields, are on track, and said the HBM4 product delivers over 11 Gbps speeds. He expressed confidence in performance, quality, and reliability.\n\nAsked about HBM share, Murphy said the company previously targeted ramping share in line with its conventional DRAM share and stated that Micron achieved that. He added that HBM is now managed like other products with portfolio decisions based on customer needs, manufacturing footprint, and value.\n\nMurphy reiterated that Micron had guided to 68% gross margin and said the company’s financial outlook has improved since earnings, driven by pricing. He cautioned that at higher margin levels, incremental price increases have a smaller mathematical impact on margin expansion than they do at lower margins, but said Micron expects margins to expand from the fiscal second quarter into the third quarter.\n\nIn addition to pricing, Murphy cited strong cost performance from the 1-gamma ramp, operational execution, “very good” spend control, and improved absorption from higher volumes. He also pointed to mix as a contributor, saying Micron’s premium technology and portfolio provide flexibility to optimize toward higher-value areas over time.\n\nOn NAND, Murphy said the business remains important and described how the industry had “ample supply” from late 2022 onward, prompting Micron to reduce utilization and slow node migrations to restore supply-demand balance. Over that period, he said Micron sharpened its NAND portfolio, brought controller capability in-house, and extended process technology leadership.\n\nMurphy said Micron now holds a “preeminent position” in NAND, focused on the data center SSD market, spanning performance TLC SSDs and capacity-oriented QLC drives. He said Micron has gained share and noted that the company discussed achieving “over a billion-dollar run rate again” in NAND during the prior quarter.\n\nMurphy described tighter NAND market conditions as storage becomes a more important part of AI system architecture. He outlined a “hot, warm, cold” tiering approach, with HBM serving the hottest data, LPDRAM supporting warm data, and drives serving cooler data, including growing key-value (KV) cache offload needs. He said this dynamic contributed to Micron’s decision to add greenfield NAND capacity in Singapore, with output expected in 2028, while supply needs before then will be met through node transitions, including a G9 transition.\n\nKumar added that Micron published a white paper on LPDDR, describing systems expected to ship this year with triple the LPDDR content compared with last year, and asserting that additional LPDDR content can reduce time to first token by 98% and significantly improve inference.\n\nMurphy closed by emphasizing that Micron will continue investing in a “disciplined way,” reassessing market conditions and competitive capacity additions, while working to expand supply and secure longer-term agreements with customers seeking supply assurance over multi-year horizons.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc is a global semiconductor company that designs and manufactures memory and storage solutions. Its product portfolio includes dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), NAND flash memory, solid-state drives (SSDs), memory modules and embedded memory solutions for a wide range of computing and electronic devices. Micron supplies components used in data centers, enterprise and cloud infrastructure, client computing, mobile devices, automotive systems and industrial applications, and also markets consumer-facing products under the Crucial brand.\n\nFounded in 1978 and headquartered in Boise, Idaho, Micron has grown into an international manufacturer with research, development and production facilities across multiple regions.\n\nThe article \" Micron Technology Says AI Memory Demand Still Outstrips Supply Through 2026, HBM4 Shipping Early \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "Microchip says the distribution channel is largely normalized with bookings strengthening (book-to-bill substantially above 1) and a March-quarter revenue outlook of +6.2%—better than typical seasonality—though end-demand visibility remains limited.\n\nThe company guided to a 61% gross margin for the March quarter, flagged internal underutilization as a ~$50–51M headwind, and reiterated a gradual path to a long-term 65% target after recovering roughly 1,000 basis points from a ~52% low.\n\nCapital allocation has shifted to deleveraging : Microchip completed a $1.5B mandatory convertible, cut net debt/EBITDA to 4.18x from 4.69x, aims for ~1.5x (anything sub-2x), will keep the dividend, and is unlikely to resume buybacks near-term.\n\nInterested in Microchip Technology Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nMicrochip Technology Says the Slump Is Ending—The Stock Is Starting to Agree\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) executives said the company is seeing signs of strengthening demand and a more normalized channel environment, while reiterating that near-term financial priorities have shifted toward debt reduction following the recent downturn.\n\nMatthias Kaestner, corporate vice president of Auto, Data Center, and Networking at Microchip, said the most significant change in the December quarter was that the distribution channel “largely normalized.” He noted that the sell-through versus sell-in gap narrowed substantially and was down to about $12 million for the quarter, which management views as evidence the channel has “largely corrected.”\n\n→ Is Albemarle Setting Up for a Lithium-Fueled Rebound?\n\nWhy These 3 Automotive & Industrial Chip Stocks Just Soared\n\nKaestner said bookings activity strengthened during the December quarter, with a book-to-bill “substantially above 1.” He also cited an acceleration in expedite requests over the past couple of quarters, indicating continued momentum into the March quarter in line with the company’s guidance.\n\nWhile Microchip said it is seeing conditions normalize, Kaestner cautioned that visibility into true end demand remains limited given a customer base of roughly 10,000 and significant exposure to distribution. He said some customers are buying “to consumption” in certain products, while others are still working through inventory in select areas, though he characterized those pockets as not representing the majority.\n\n→ Cisco Systems Below $82? Buy Now, It Won’t Last—$182 Is Coming\n\nAI Demand Is Coming—Is Microchip Technology Ready?\n\nIn response to questions about “better-than-seasonal” growth, Microchip pointed to its March-quarter outlook of 6.2% growth, which Kaestner said compares with a typical seasonal pattern of 2% to 3% growth in the March quarter. He added that the company’s best visibility remains about one quarter out, and while momentum is improving, the company was not making additional forecasts beyond March other than expecting the recovery to continue if current trends persist.\n\nOn supply dynamics, Kaestner said Microchip still has about 200 days of inventory and does not face issues on wafers produced in its internal fabs, where it maintains short lead times in most cases. Lead time extension, he said, is primarily tied to the most advanced external foundry nodes “all the way to 3 nanometers,” as well as certain assembly-related inputs such as substrates and OSAT-supplied components.\n\n→ Amazon Bets Big on BETA: Why Analysts See 50% Upside\n\nMicrochip executives discussed manufacturing mix and how it affects profitability. Kaestner said the company’s footprint is roughly 37% to 40% internal manufacturing and about 60% external. Products made on 110-nanometer and larger nodes are mostly internal, while 90-nanometer and below is largely external.\n\nHe said current momentum in aerospace and defense, networking, and data center is tied to “richer mix” and higher-margin products that are predominantly produced at outside foundries. Meanwhile, Microchip reported internal underutilization as “the only headwind to gross margins today after the March quarter,” quantified at about $50 million to $51 million.\n\nMicrochip’s March-quarter gross margin guidance calls for 61%. Executives noted that the March-quarter improvement includes the elimination of inventory reserve charges. Kaestner added that previously written-off inventory could provide additional benefit if it sells through, but emphasized that the magnitude and timing are not predictable.\n\nManagement reiterated confidence in achieving a long-term 65% gross margin target, but said the timeline is gradual and likely extends through this calendar year into next year. Kaestner referenced Microchip’s “nine-point recovery plan” and said the company has already recovered roughly 1,000 basis points from a gross margin low around 52%.\n\nExecutives described data center as one of Microchip’s larger segments and said it has increased in share of the company’s revenue portfolio over the past year, while automotive declined somewhat but is “coming back.” Microchip reported compute and data center represented roughly 19% of the prior fiscal year’s revenue, and management said additional end-market color is expected in the next quarter as the company updates its annual end-market rollup.\n\nKaestner outlined three main pillars of Microchip’s data center business:\n\nPCI Express switching and retimers: Microchip supports PCIe generations 3 through 6. Kaestner said the company has introduced a Gen 6 PCIe switch built on 3-nanometer technology, which he said offers a power advantage and is generating customer interest.\n\nFlash controllers and software stack: Microchip provides controllers for large flash storage systems along with a “complete software stack,” which Kaestner described as complex and gaining traction as speeds increase generation to generation.\n\nHDD controllers: Kaestner said hard disk drives remain relevant due to cost-effective storage and are expected to have a long lifetime, with hyperscalers continuing to use HDDs for certain content where maximum access speeds aren’t required.\n\nHe also cited feature development such as security enhancements and Post-Quantum Cryptography as areas being embedded into products to help data center deployments be “future-proof.”\n\nDiscussing PCIe, Kaestner said it remains a standard interface used across server processors and GPUs, and that the pace of PCIe generation cycles has compressed from roughly three to four years to about 18 to 24 months. He said Microchip increased development efforts to stay at the forefront of those cycles and that deployments can span both scale-up and scale-out architectures depending on customer designs.\n\nIn automotive, Kaestner said Microchip’s presence extends beyond microcontrollers into areas such as touch controllers, car access systems (including key fobs and hands-free entry), and in-vehicle networking products spanning LIN, CAN, MOST, and early automotive Ethernet. He described a trend toward consolidating numerous in-vehicle communication standards into Ethernet-based systems and said Microchip is positioned with automotive switches and transceivers ranging from 10BASE-T1S to gigabit speeds.\n\nKaestner also highlighted PCIe as an emerging automotive connectivity pillar, describing automotive PCIe switches derived from the company’s PCIe Gen 4 data center switch design and adapted with automotive safety and security features and fewer lanes to reduce cost. Additionally, he discussed an acquisition completed in April of the prior year related to camera-to-compute and compute-to-display connectivity and said Microchip is involved in the Automotive SerDes Alliance (ASA) alongside OEMs including BMW, with products in market and proof-of-concept activity underway.\n\nOn China, executives said the market remains volatile but characterized many Chinese customers as pragmatic and willing to buy U.S. semiconductor products if price and features align. They noted stronger competitive pressure at the low end (microcontrollers and some analog), while citing continued design momentum in automotive for complex features that local competitors do not yet offer. Management said a “high single digit” portion of Microchip revenue stays within China and is not re-exported, and described restrictions affecting some advanced products tied to certain infrastructure-related entities, but said the impact to Microchip has not been dramatic.\n\nFinally, Investor Relations executive Sajid Daudi said Microchip’s near-term financial focus has shifted toward reducing debt after the downturn drove EBITDA lower and pushed net debt-to-EBITDA higher. He said the company completed a $1.5 billion mandatory convertible offering to address leverage concerns. Daudi said net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.18x last quarter, down from 4.69x, and reiterated a longer-term target discussed previously of 1.5x, noting “anything sub-2” remains the direction of travel.\n\nDaudi said Microchip’s dividend remains intact, but indicated buybacks are unlikely in the near term as the company prioritizes deleveraging. He added that the most recent quarter was the first in several quarters where cash flow covered the dividend, rather than requiring borrowing.\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc is a semiconductor company headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, that designs, develops and supplies a broad portfolio of embedded control and analog semiconductors. Its product lineup centers on microcontrollers (including the well-known PIC family), digital signal controllers and associated development tools and software, along with a range of mixed-signal and analog devices, nonvolatile memory, power management, timing, interface, wireless and security products. The company also provides integrated hardware and software solutions intended to simplify embedded design and accelerate time to market for OEMs and contract manufacturers.\n\nMicrochip's products are used across a wide range of end markets, including automotive, industrial automation, consumer electronics, communications, aerospace and defense, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\n\nThe article \" Microchip Technology Sees Demand Strengthen as Channel Normalizes, Shifts Focus to Debt Paydown \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) investing should still be at the forefront of investors' minds. Although some may worry about the hyperscalers overspending on data centers for use in AI, the reality is that the demand is there. This leads to some huge investment opportunities in the AI sphere, and there are plenty of ways to profit from this trend.\n\nI've got five AI stocks that look like great buys in February, and investors should be racing to load up on them before the market sends them far higher.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nThere are several huge beneficiaries of all of this AI spending, but Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are at the top of the list. Both companies make computing equipment that is heavily used in AI data centers , and with the huge amount of spending occurring in that area, they will see strong growth as a result.\n\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the industry standard for AI computing. Nvidia's entire technology stack outperforms any other option available, making it the go-to vendor in this segment.\n\nBroadcom is partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to design custom AI chips that are tailored to the workflows they will see.\n\nBoth Nvidia's GPUs and Broadcom's custom chips have their specific use cases in AI, and each will continue to be a part of the computing muscle that powers AI workloads. With each company being a major beneficiary of the spending by the AI hyperscalers, they're set to perform quite well over the next few years.\n\nAnother beneficiary of this spending is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . Taiwan Semiconductor fabricates most of the logic chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, but it's also the supplier for many other key tech companies. Without TSMC's foundry capabilities, none of the AI technology we see today would be possible. Furthermore, the rising tide of AI spending lifts all boats, and with TSMC being a chip supplier to nearly every major AI component out there, it's slated to do quite well during the next few years.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC's new 2-nanometer chip technology promises reduced power consumption, which helps alleviate the energy crisis as all these AI data centers start coming online. As long as there is AI spending, Taiwan Semiconductor will continue to be a top option in the space.\n\nBoth Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) saw their shares fall in reaction to their latest earnings results. However, sell-offs of these stocks aren't really warranted. Each is a key player in the cloud computing industry, which is why they are spending so much to build out their AI footprints.\n\nAlthough equipment providers like Nvidia and Broadcom may have a more difficult time selling their hardware once an adequate amount of AI computing capacity has been built, the cloud computing providers will have a near-endless stream of demand and revenue. By renting out their computing capacity to others, they can profit from several generative AI companies creating huge, new businesses in the AI gold rush. However, instead of having to spend money putting up new data centers, they can maintain their old ones, which is far cheaper.\n\nFurthermore, both cloud computing providers are seeing soaring demand, which shows that AI capital investment spending is warranted. Microsoft Azure revenue rose 39% during its latest quarter, while Google Cloud blew away all expectations and revenue rose 48%. The reality is, the growth rates justify all this spending, and Alphabet and Microsoft are two of the best in the tech universe.\n\nI think the recent price pullbacks are a gift to investors, and each can make for a great cornerstone investment in your portfolio.",

Davidson分析師路里亞（Gil Luria）在12日首度將台積電納入研究範圍，不僅給予買進評等外，也評論台積電是「AI周期核心的一環，能在各種情境下奪得絕大部分獲利。」路里亞透露，台積電目前正加速量產2奈米晶片，且1.6奈米製程也將在今年下半年投入量產；儘管競爭對手在技術上奮力追趕，但台積電將新架構轉化為高良率、高產能製造的能力，才是真正拉開差距的關鍵。據彭博資料顯示，目前已至少有37家機構將台積電ADR納入評等。\n台積電美股週四盤中一度觸及380美元歷史高點，終場下跌1.6%，收在368.10美元。週五股價再跌0.47%，終場報366.36美元。\n◎《FTNN新聞網》提醒您：本資料僅供參考，投資人應獨立判斷，審慎評估並自負投資風險。",

And of course, top and bottom line peaks are projected this year.\n\nWall Street expects Micron’s EPS to spike 300% in FY26 to a record $33.22, a staggering acceleration that reflects both pricing power and volume growth. Better still, FY27 EPS is projected to climb another 35% to a whopping $44.95.\n\nSince most recently crushing earnings expectations for its fiscal first quarter in December, Micron’s FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates have continued to trend higher and are now up 78% and 91% in the last 60 days, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstonishingly, the year-ago earnings estimates picture shows that FY26 and FY27 EPS revisions have now skyrocketed 207% and 490%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nJust as captivating is that despite such an exhilarating rally, Micron stock still trades at 12X forward earnings. This is well below the rather stretched P/E premiums other high-growth tech stocks can command and offers a distinct discount to the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nMore intriguing, MU trades nicely beneath Sandisk Corporation SNDK and Western Digital’s WDC forward earnings multiples of 23X and 31X, as two of the other prime beneficiaries of the global memory chip shortage.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron has enjoyed exceptional pricing power, an advantage that strongly supports the continued momentum in its stock.

This is well below the rather stretched P/E premiums other high-growth tech stocks can command and offers a distinct discount to the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nMore intriguing, MU trades nicely beneath Sandisk Corporation SNDK and Western Digital’s WDC forward earnings multiples of 23X and 31X, as two of the other prime beneficiaries of the global memory chip shortage.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron has enjoyed exceptional pricing power, an advantage that strongly supports the continued momentum in its stock. Since being added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on August 20, 2025, Micron stock has soared a staggering 865% .\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Applied Materials ( AMAT ) reported its Q1 earnings on February 12. The earnings beat consensus estimates for adjusted EPS and revenue, and the stock is trading 10% higher at the time of writing, Friday morning, Feb. 13, according to Yahoo Finance .\n\nThe supplier of semiconductor and semiconductor-related fabrication equipment reported revenue of $7 billion, a 2% year-over-year decline, yet the earnings report got investors excited and prompted Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya to raise his price target for Applied Materials.\n\nThe cause of excitement was CEO Gary Dickerson’s prepared remarks during the earnings call : “For Applied, we expect to grow our semiconductor equipment business more than 20% this calendar year. We see the demand profile weighted towards the second half of the calendar year, with availability of customer cleanroom space being a key factor pacing the rate of investment.”\n\nDickerson continued by making this great outlook sound even better. “Our largest customers are giving us increased longer-term visibility to ensure we have operational capacity and service support in place for their ramps,\" he added.\n\n\"Based on this visibility, we expect strong growth momentum to be carried into 2027.”\n\nTo put it all in perspective, we can look at the complete Q2 guidance versus what analysts expected. The numbers come from the Bank of America research note shared with TheStreet.\n\nMetric\n\nManagement Guidance (Q2 2026)\n\nWall Street Consensus\n\nBank of America\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n$7.65 Billion (±$500M)\n\n$7.03 Billion\n\n$6.85 billion\n\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS\n\n$2.64 (±$0.20)\n\n$2.29\n\n$2.20\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\n\n~49.3%\n\n48.5%\n\n48.4%\n\nThe great outlook makes even more sense when we consider what the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) estimates for 2026.\n\n“The global semiconductor industry posted its highest-ever annual sales in 2025, nearly hitting $800 billion, and global sales in 2026 are projected to reach roughly $1 trillion,” stated SIA CEO John Neuffer.\n\nFollowing the report’s release, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya and his team updated their view on AMAT stock.\n\nRevenue of $7.65 billion\n\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.64\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 49.3%\n\nThe team estimates the company will gain approximately 1% in 2026, thanks to cyclical growth, leadership in DRAM, advanced packaging, and deposition and conductor etch systems.\n\nAnalysts raised their non-GAAP EPS estimates for 2026 and 2027 by 18% and 24% to $11.86 and $14.57, respectively.\n\nApplied Global Services could grow at a rate higher than the typical low-double-digit pace through steady install base expansion, with all recurring revenue helping fund capital returns.\n\nApplied Materials captures more than 50% of the serviceable addressable market share in inflection points such as Gate-All-Around (GAA) and backside power delivery, where revenue opportunities increase by 30% versus FinFET .\n\nSystems' gross margins of 54% improved by 1% year over year and can expand further as Applied Materials prices to value.",

      "Content": "It has been just under a year since digital storage giant Western Digital spun off flash storage specialist Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) , and the latter has turned into one of the hottest stocks on the market since its separation.\n\nShares of the company -- which specializes in NAND flash storage solutions for smartphones, personal computers (PCs), tablets, automotive applications, wearable devices, and data centers -- have shot up a stunning 1,400% since the spin-off. Investors may now be wondering whether it is worth holding this semiconductor stock after its red-hot rally.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nLet's take a closer look at Sandisk's long-term prospects and check whether it can deliver more upside over the next three years.\n\nWe have already seen that Sandisk's storage solutions are used across multiple applications. The edge devices market, which includes PCs and smartphones, is its largest business segment, accounting for 55% of its revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on Jan. 2, 2026). Sandisk's revenue from this segment shot up by 63% from the year-ago period, to just under $1.7 billion.\n\nThe company pointed out that the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the PC and smartphone markets is a major catalyst for this segment. That's not surprising, as generative AI-capable smartphones and PCs are equipped with higher storage to support local AI tasks. Importantly, shipments of these devices are poised to accelerate at a healthy pace over the next three years.\n\nMarket research firm IDC estimates that generative AI smartphone shipments could jump to 912 million units in 2028, up from 234 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, generative AI PC shipments are predicted to jump to 138 million units in 2028, up from just over 24 million units in 2024. So, Sandisk should continue to witness healthy demand from these end markets in the long run.\n\nAt the same time, investors should note the strong growth Sandisk is witnessing in data centers, where demand for fast flash storage solutions such as solid-state drives (SSDs) is increasing. SSDs offer much faster data transfer speeds and greater energy efficiency than hard-disk drives (HDDs). Specifically, SSDs can be a hundred times faster than HDDs, enabling instant data transfer at higher bandwidths.\n\nOf course, HDDs are significantly cheaper than SSDs. However, the shortage of HDDs is pushing AI infrastructure companies toward SSDs. SSDs can also reduce the total operating costs of data centers thanks to their energy efficiency and faster data transfer rates.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see the data center business moving the needle in a bigger way for Sandisk over the next three years, especially considering the massive investments in this space . The company reported a 76% year-over-year increase in data center revenue in the previous quarter to $440 million. This impressive growth seems sustainable, as Sandisk's storage solutions have been qualified for use by a second hyperscaler customer, and it is on track to bring additional hyperscalers on board.\n\nSandisk notes that it will begin recognizing revenue from its new hyperscaler customers in the next few quarters. All this explains why analysts are expecting a sharp spike in Sandisk's top line. Specifically, its revenue is expected to more than double in the current fiscal year from $7.36 billion in the previous one, followed by another significant jump in the next fiscal year.\n\nSandisk isn't just enjoying healthy top-line growth. The supply-constrained nature of the memory market is also pushing prices higher. According to market research firm TrendForce, NAND flash memory prices could jump by 55% to 60% in the ongoing quarter, up from the earlier estimate of 33% to 38%.\n\nWhat's more, NAND flash memory is expected to remain in short supply through 2028, driven by a jump of almost 3x in demand by that time as compared to 2024 levels. This should pave the way for a robust jump in Sandisk's earnings, following a projected 1,220% increase in the current one to $39.45 per share. As the following chart indicates, Sandisk's earnings could almost double in the next fiscal year.\n\nGiven that the flash storage market is likely to sustain solid growth beyond next year, Sandisk could see a big jump in its earnings after the next couple of years. But even if we assume a conservative 25% increase in its bottom line in fiscal 2028, its earnings could jump to just over $95 per share within the next three years.\n\nMultiplying the projected earnings by the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 25 points toward a stock price of $2,375, which is over 4x Sandisk's current stock price. So this AI stock has the potential to become a multibagger over the next three years. That's why investors should consider buying it hand over fist, as it is trading at just 15 times forward earnings right now.",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), as well as two micro-cap stocks Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc. (NGVC) and Team, Inc. (TISI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is benefiting from the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI)-driven memory and storage markets. The positive impacts of inventory improvement across multiple end markets are driving top-line growth.\n\nThe surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery will aid significant revenue and earnings growth in the coming quarters. Its solid financials, positive free cash flow and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while enhancing shareholder value.\n\nMicron Technology&rsquo;s long-term customer agreements and expanding AI partnerships reduce volatility and enhance revenue visibility. Nonetheless, rising operating costs and a massive increase in capital expenditure pose a downside risk to Micron&rsquo;s near-term profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>> )\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past six months (+22.3% vs. +7.5%). The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. It is refocusing on the core strengths of investment banking (IB) and trading businesses through restructuring and scaling back its consumer banking footprint, which will likely support top line growth in the upcoming period.\n\nHowever, its high dependence on overseas revenues is worrisome. The rising expense base due to ongoing investments in technology and elevated transaction-based costs during periods of higher client activity might hamper near term profitability.\n\nNonetheless, the company's expansion in the private equity credit market is expected to diversify revenues and will support its growth over the long run. Further, a solid liquidity profile will support its capital distribution activities.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Goldman Sachs here >>> )\n\nVerizon&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past six months (+17.7% vs. -1.3%). The company recorded solid fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The buyout of Frontier Communications has accelerated its broadband expansion plans.\n\nVerizon appears to be at a critical inflection point and remains focused on making necessary capital expenditures for steady 5G deployment, the densification of the 4G LTE wireless network to cater to huge traffic demands across multiple verticals and fiber densification.\n\nHowever, the spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage surging data traffic. High spending on promotional activities to attract customers is straining Verizon&rsquo;s profits. Weakness in the wireline business is another concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>> )\n\nShares of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage have underperformed the Zacks Food - Natural Foods Products industry over the past six months (-32.8% vs. -25.9%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $595.64 million is facing risks which include margin pressure from inventory shrink, long-term lease obligations limiting flexibility, macro and supply chain vulnerabilities, and weak digital capabilities. Trading at just 0.43X EV/sales and 6.02X EV/EBITDA, valuations are attractive versus peers.\n\nNevertheless, Natural Grocers posted a 14% YoY rise in Q1 FY26 net income to $11.3M, with EPS up to 49 cents, supported by disciplined cost control and 1.6% revenue growth. EBITDA rose to $22.6M, highlighting operational leverage despite modest top-line gains. Strong liquidity ($23.2M cash, $67.6M credit availability) and a debt-light balance sheet support a 25% dividend hike and active buybacks.\n\nNatural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage is expanding cautiously with 6&ndash;8 new stores planned, enhancing brand reach in underserved markets. Its 900+ private-label SKUs support margin and loyalty, reinforcing differentiation in the competitive organic segment. Operating efficiency improved.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage here >>> )\n\nTeam&rsquo;s shares have underperformed the Zacks Building Products - Maintenance Service industry over the past six months (-34.3% vs. +2.5%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $65.64 million is facing structural leverage, high interest burden, persistent GAAP losses, working capital drag, MS segment margin volatility and contingent legal liabilities. Upside hinges on sustained margin expansion, cash flow conversion and progress toward double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins.\n\nNevertheless, Team benefits from a large, durable opportunity in critical infrastructure services, supported by aging assets, regulatory requirements, and sustained energy, midstream and industrial demand. The third-quarter 2025 results showed solid execution, with 6.7% year-over-year revenue growth, strong momentum in the IHT and MS segments, and meaningful margin expansion,driven by pricing, mix and cost discipline.\n\nCanadian operations are recovering, validating localized commercial strategies, while an integrated service model supports lifecycle-driven growth and operating leverage.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Team here >>> )\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

      "Content": "Let’s get this straight: I don’t want to bash any ETF issuer. I want to bash the idea that investors need to chase leverage – and that they need even more new tools to do that.\n\nIn my experience, this phenomenon is what drives events like Thursday’s new launch from Direxion, a pioneer of issuing funds that help individual investors act more like traders.\n\n3 Highest-yielding Dividend Aristocrats That'll Pay You For Generations\n\nCooler January CPI Signals an Inflation Thaw\n\nCompetition Is Heating Up for Micron. Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold MU Stock Now?\n\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nFor active traders, Direxion added to its line of leveraged and inverse tools this week, introducing four new 2x leveraged ETFs that aim to deliver 2x the daily return of an individual stock. Added to the roster, and to the market’s overwhelming number of these types of ETFs:\n\nDirexion Daily ASML Bull 2X ETF (ASMU)\n\nDirexion Daily BABA Bull 2X ETF (BABU)\n\nDirexion Daily MRVL Bull 2X ETF (MRVU)\n\nDirexion Daily SOFI Bull 2X ETF (SOFA)\n\nMy concern is not about these funds themselves. It is twofold.\n\nFirst, that they will be misused by investors. I know, that’s their problem, not mine. but when someone gambles on a leveraged index ETF on a basket of stocks, even a basket of 10-20 of them, there’s some diversification. Not here.\n\nOf course, the key to using this is position sizing, which I talk about here a lot. When I buy a leveraged ETF, I typically buy it at the same exposure level I would an unleveraged ETF. So if I were buying ASMU, I’d ask myself, “what would be my starting position in ASML if I were buying it right now?” Then I’d divide that percentage of my portfolio and/or dollar amount in half. That’s how much ASMU I’d buy.\n\nSecond, this reminds me of many past market eras, where the product flood gates opened, as if to “ring a bell at the top.”\n\nLet’s close here by charting the underlying stocks of those four new Direxion 2x bull ETFs.\n\nASML (ASML) is indecisive but overvalued technically. And selling at more than 50 trailing earnings.\n\nAlibaba (BABA): Chart is leaking, $120 is a potential target. Chinese stocks’ latest rally was the typical 50% in a flash, then a skittish few months. Look at the chart to see how this has become routine for Alibaba. That makes it a good candidate for both leveraged long and short ETFs.\n\nMarvell (MRVL): Any stock with a 10-month range from $120 to $50 a share is ripe for leveraged ETFs, right? But only if you know your limits.\n\nSoFi (SOFI): Easily the worst of the bunch, currently. This chart has $10 written all over it. The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is in worse shape than it has been at any point in this most recent descent. Translation: sellers are piling on, and rallies are being sold. Hard.\n\nRemember what destroys capital most, based on Wall Street’s long history. It is not missing upside, it is getting hammered by using leverage like a gambling tool.\n\nThis is a time when the temptations are greater than they’ve ever been for retail investors. Learn risk management.\n\nIronically, in this article focusing on four new 2x leveraged long ETFs, the charts here make more of a case to start screening for funds that rise when stocks fall.\n\nAnd since these stocks cannot be singled out, since there are hundreds that look like this, there are plenty of ways to start developing defensive investing skills. Barchart’s ETF screener is a great place to start.\n\nRob Isbitts created the ROAR Score , based on his 40+ years of technical analysis experience.

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the tech landscape at breakneck speed, and investors are scrambling to lock in the biggest winners. Yet even in a crowded AI trade, few names have delivered like Micron Technology (MU). The memory-chip giant has ridden the AI wave to record highs, with MU stock delivering massive returns over the past year. Surging demand for memory chips from AI hyperscalers racing to build out massive data center capacity has been the primary engine behind Micron’s remarkable ascent.\n\nBut every rally eventually meets a reality check. Micron’s momentum recently hit a speed bump earlier this week after reports suggested that Samsung Electronics is nearing certification from Nvidia (NVDA) for its next-generation HBM4 chips. High-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized chip designed to move enormous volumes of data at ultra-fast speeds, is a critical component inside AI accelerators.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nCooler January CPI Signals an Inflation Thaw\n\n3 Software Stocks to Buy on the Dip Now, According to Analysts\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nNvidia relies heavily on HBM for its AI processors, making supplier approvals a closely watched development on Wall Street. Now, with Samsung reportedly preparing to begin mass production of its next-generation HBM chips earlier than expected, competitive dynamics in the AI memory space could shift quickly.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant’s progress threatens to add meaningful pressure on Micron, which is a key supplier of advanced memory products used across data centers and AI infrastructure. Given this latest development, should you buy, sell, or hold MU stock? Let's take a closer look.\n\nBased in Boise, Idaho, Micron Technology stands at the center of the global memory market, supplying the chips that quietly power today’s data-driven world. The company designs and manufactures a broad portfolio of DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory products that sit inside everything from cloud data centers to smartphones and connected devices.\n\nWith a strong emphasis on engineering expertise and manufacturing scale, Micron plays a critical role in enabling AI workloads and other compute-intensive applications. From large-scale data centers to edge devices and mobile platforms, its memory and storage solutions form the backbone of systems that process, store, and move vast amounts of information every day. With a market capitalization of roughly $465 billion, Micron has grown into a semiconductor heavyweight.\n\nShares dipped about 2.8% on Feb. 9 following news surrounding Samsung, but that pullback barely dents what has been an extraordinary run. Over the past year, the stock has skyrocketed an eye-popping 336%, leaving the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) — up just 12% over the same stretch — far in the dust. After touching a record high of $455.50 last month, Micron now sits only about 9% below that peak, underscoring just how powerful its AI-fueled rally has been.\n\nWhile Micron has delivered a breathtaking rally, its valuation remains far from excessive. MU stock trades at roughly 12.6 times forward earnings, a sharp discount to the sector median of 23.6 times. For a company powering the AI memory boom, that gap suggests investors are still paying a relatively modest price for its growth trajectory, even after an extraordinary run.\n\nMicron kicked off fiscal 2026 with a strong quarter. In its Dec. 17 earnings report, the company crushed both top- and bottom-line expectations, posting revenue of $13.6 billion, up 57% year-over-year (YOY) and comfortably ahead of the $12.7 billion consensus estimate. The results marked Micron’s third-straight quarter of record revenue, powered by a 69% surge in DRAM sales and a 22% increase in NAND revenue.\n\nDRAM alone generated $10.8 billion, accounting for 79% of total sales, while NAND contributed $2.7 billion, or 20%. Notably, total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, HBM and data center revenue, and revenue across each business unit all reached new records. Cloud memory sales climbed to $5.28 billion, doubling YOY, while core data center revenue rose 4% annually to $2.38 billion.\n\nThe company said performance across both major segments was driven by higher pricing. Profitability also followed a similar growth trajectory. Adjusted gross margin came in at 56.8%, up from 39.5% in the year-ago quarter. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS soared a stunning 167% YOY to $4.78, crushing the Street’s $3.78 estimate.\n\nLooking ahead, Micron struck an optimistic tone for Q2 fiscal 2026, projecting revenue of around $18.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.42. Management expects strong AI-driven demand across data centers and edge computing to continue, even as supply constraints are likely to persist through 2026, a backdrop that could further reinforce pricing strength.\n\nDespite intensifying competition, Wall Street’s conviction in Micron remains firmly intact. MU stock carries a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, with 33 out of 42 analysts calling it a “Strong Buy,” six assigning a “Moderate Buy” rating, and just three recommending a “Hold.”\n\nEven after its powerful run, optimism hasn’t faded. While MU has already surged beyond its average price target of $345.97, the Street-high target of $500 implies that there could still be roughly 21% upside ahead. That's a sign that many analysts believe the AI-driven momentum is far from over.",

      "Content": "Cisco is well-positioned to benefit from a multi-year tech refresh cycle.\n\nAI underpins the need for newer, faster, more efficient networking and connectivity solutions.\n\nAnalysts and institutions support this market: dividends, distribution growth, and buybacks attract buy-and-hold investors.\n\nInterested in Cisco Systems, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nIt is a bold statement to say Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) stock will advance by $100 to $182, but there are forces at play and precedents that suggest just that. Cisco’s share price crossed a significant threshold in early February, rising above the $82 level to set a fresh all-time high.\n\nThe all-time high is significant enough on its own; however, it is the stock's first since the DotCom bubble burst, so it marks a pivot point for this market. Others, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), have crossed similar thresholds and advanced by modest-to-high triple-digit amounts.\n\n→ Is Albemarle Setting Up for a Lithium-Fueled Rebound?\n\nCisco’s driver is an AI-driven, multi-year tech refresh cycle. Not only do existing data centers need to be updated to modern standards, but new ones are being built at an aggressive pace, and there is all that enterprise networking to account for, which supports the Internet and global economies. The critical takeaway is that Cisco, as a leading provider, is well-entrenched in the marketplace and positioned to benefit from a tailwind expected to persist for many years.\n\nWhile the 20X earnings at which the stock trades in mid-February is a bit high relative to recent years, it likely underestimates the company’s strength. The more significant detail is that, trading at only 14X the 2030 forecast, there is an opportunity for the stock price to increase by at least 50% over the coming years as its earnings grow and outpace the forecast.\n\n→ Amazon Bets Big on BETA: Why Analysts See 50% Upside\n\nCapital returns are among the drivers of Cisco's stock price. Cisco was a high-quality dividend-paying and share-repurchasing company before its Q2 release, with a market-beating yield, reliability, and a declining share count.\n\nRegarding the dividend, it is well above average, yielding about 1.9% as of February, and is safe at only 40% of this year’s earnings guidance, at the low end of the range.\n\n→ Cisco Systems Below $82? Buy Now, It Won’t Last—$182 Is Coming\n\nThe company is known for distribution increases, having made annual increases for 15 years, and is likely to extend the trend over the coming years. Regarding share buybacks, the Q2 2026 activity aided a 0.5% year-to-date share count reduction and is expected to continue at a similar pace through year’s end. The latest data suggests this company has sufficient authorization for about 10 more quarters at the Q2 pace.\n\nCisco’s Q2 results were solid, and the analysts liked what they saw. The company reported 10% system-wide growth, with $15.35 billion in revenue, 150 basis points better than expected, and strong earnings. Revenue growth was driven by product and services revenue, with product revenue up by 20%, underpinned by networking’s 20% increase.\n\nGeographically, all regions showed strength, and the margin news was positive. The company’s lean into CapEx, innovation, and growth investments is cutting into cash flow, but that is a near-term headwind. Adjusted earnings grew at a slightly accelerated 11% pace, outpacing estimates by 195 bps, and are expected to remain strong through year’s end.\n\nMarketBeat tracked several analyst updates immediately following the release, including several price targets that were reaffirmed or increased. The new targets align with a consensus-or-better price point, suggesting a minimum 20% upside is possible.\n\nA move to new highs could open the door to much larger movements, including one that equals the trading range that has dominated price action over the past 26 years.\n\nThe $70 range magnitude suggests a move to the $150 level is possible over time.\n\nThe article \" Cisco Systems Below $82?

      "Content": "Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) reported positive free cash flow (FCF) for the latest quarter ending Jan. 24, 2026, albeit lower than last year. Nevertheless, its FCF margin is still strong, and despite higher capex, management's guidance was for higher earnings.\n\nAs a result, analysts have higher target prices for CSCO stock. For example, Yahoo! Finance now reports that the average of 26 analysts' price targets is $87.86.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nCSCO is trading at $76.87 , down from a recent peak of $86.78 on Feb. 9, just before the Feb. 11 earnings release.\n\nBased on its strong FCF and FCF margins, despite higher AI-related investments and capital expenditures (capex), Cisco Systems' stock has good upside. This article will show why and a conservative way to play CSCO.\n\nCisco reported that its fiscal Q2 revenue (ending Jan. 24, 2026) was up 10.3% to $15.3 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) rose faster, +11%.\n\nHowever, its operating cash flow (OCF), which includes all cash flow before capital expenditures (capex), was down from $2.24 billion last year to $1.82 billion.\n\nNevertheless, that still represented 11.8% of its quarterly revenue, albeit lower than last year's 16 OCF margin and 21.% in the prior quarter. This can be seen on page 17 of its slide deck:\n\nHowever, after higher capex spending, its Q2 FCF was $1.539 billion (10.0% of revenue) compared to $2.03 billion last year (14.5% FCF margin), according to Stock Analysis.\n\nMoreover, over the trailing 12 months (TTM), its FCF was still strong ($12.24 billion), representing 20.73% of TTM revenue. That was down less from the prior year's 23.6% FCF margin.\n\nAs a result, based on management's higher revenue forecasts for this year, we can expect that FCF could be higher over the next 12 months (NTM).\n\nFor example, management guided that this year it expects revenue to range between $61.2 billion and $61.7 billion (see page 4 of its earnings release). The midpoint of $61.45 billion is 8.5% higher than last year's $56.65 billion revenue.\n\nIn fact, analysts' forecasts are higher. Seeking Alpha shows that 19 analysts project $61.56 billion for the year ending July 2026, and $64.93 billion for the following fiscal year. That implies that over the next 12 months (NTM) revenue could rise to $63.245 billion , up 11.64% over FY 2025.\n\nAs a result, if we assume that Cisco Systems could maintain around 21% FCF margin (slightly higher than its TTM 20.73% margin), FCF could rise to almost $13.3 billion:\n\n$63.245 billion NTM revenue x 0.21 = $13.28 billion NTM FCF\n\nThat would be over $1 billion higher than its LTM FCF of $12.24 billion, or +8.5%.\n\nAs a result, CSCO's value over the next 12 months (NTM) could be higher. Here's why.\n\nRight now, Cisco's stock has a market capitalization of $302.456 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance. As a result, its FCF yield on a trailing 12-month (TTM) basis is just over 4%:\n\n$12.24b TTM FCF / $302.456 b mkt cap = 0.0405 = 4.05% FCF yield\n\nAssuming its FCF yield improves to 4.0% over the next 12 months, the market value could rise to $332 billion:\n\n$13.28 NTM FCF / 0.04 = $332 billion NTM mkt cap\n\nThat's $30 billion higher than todays mkt cap or about 10% higher.\n\nIn other words, even before share buybacks, which have been strong at Cisco, its price target (PT) is 10% higher:\n\n$76.87 x 1.10 = $84.56 PT (i.e., +10%)\n\nThat is even lower than Yahoo! Finance's survey PT of $87.86, and Barchart's mean survey PT of $87.15 per share. Moreover, 18 analysts surveyed by AnaChart.com, which tracks recent analyst write-ups, show an average PT of $98.23. These surveys average $91.06 , or +18.5% higher.\n\nThe bottom line is that CSCO stock could be worth between 10% to 18.5% more than today's price.\n\nOne way to conservatively play this is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in one-month expiration periods. That way, an investor can get paid while setting a potential lower buy-in point.\n\nFor example, look at the March 20, 2026, expiration period. It shows that the $72.50 strike price put, over 5% lower than today's price, has a midpoint premium of $0.87 per put contract.\n\nThat means a short-seller can make $87 immediately after securing $7,250 with their brokerage firm and placing a “Sell to Open” trade order for this contract.\n\nThat represents a one-month yield of 1.20% (i.e., $87/$7,250). The worst that can happen is CSCO falls to $72.50 or lower, and the collateral is used to buy 100 shares at that price.\n\nThis could result in an unrealized capital loss. But the breakeven point is $71.63 (i.e., $72.50-$0.87), which is 6.8% lower than today's price. So, it provides a good potential entry point.\n\nMoreover, less risk-averse investors could use the premium to help buy longer-dated in-the-money (ITM) CSCO call options. That way, they can gain upside in CSCO stock that is potentially greater than buying CSCO shares. I have discussed this in other articles.\n\nThe bottom line is that Cisco Systems' stock looks cheap here, and shorting OTM puts and buying ITM calls are conservative ways to play CSCO.",

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nGil Luria, an analyst, noted that the company's caution has nothing to do with AMD's overall business, which is still strong in consumer and server CPUs. Instead, the worry is about AMD's ability to compete in the rapidly rising market for artificial intelligence accelerators.\n\nLuria said that performance at scale depended on more than just chip characteristics, even if AMD's Instinct MI300 GPUs seem to do well on technical benchmarks. Nvidia is ahead of the game when it comes to sophisticated networking, software integration, and ecosystem support, which are all things that large AI training clusters need.\n\nThe expert said that AMD was behind in AI accelerators and that big AI developers still relied largely on Nvidia systems for heavy workloads.\n\nEven if the company is neutral, the overall mood on Wall Street is still favorable, and many analysts still give AMD buy recommendations because they think the company has a lot of room to develop in the long run.",

      "Content": "Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) have struggled so far this year, with the stock down more than 18% year-to-date (YTD) and nearly 32% below its 52-week high. Despite the significant pullback, unfavorable industry dynamics around memory supply could weigh on QCOM’s earnings. With sentiment already negative, the possibility of the stock revisiting its two-year low of $120.80 cannot be ruled out.\n\nQualcomm delivered better-than-expected Q1 financial numbers. Revenue of $12.3 billion rose 5% YoY and slightly exceeded consensus expectations, reflecting steady demand across key end markets. The Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) segment delivered $1.6 billion in revenue with a strong EBT margin, supported by higher unit volumes and a favorable product mix.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nThe core Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) business posted revenue of $10.6 billion, driven by demand across smartphones, automotive, and IoT markets. Handset revenues within QCT climbed to a record $7.8 billion, benefiting from the launch cycle of premium flagship devices. IoT revenue grew 9% YoY to $1.7 billion, driven by consumer and networking applications, while automotive revenue reached $1.1 billion, up 15%, as adoption of Snapdragon Digital Chassis platforms accelerated.\n\nIts adjusted EPS of $3.50 rose 3% YoY and surpassed expectations.\n\nThe market’s negative reaction to QCOM stock reflects management’s weak guidance. Management guided for second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.45 to $2.65, both below Wall Street expectations. This raised concerns that near-term headwinds will likely weigh on its growth.\n\nThe most significant challenge impacting Qualcomm's growth is the uncertainty in global memory markets. Surging demand for memory solutions, led by AI data centers, has diverted supply away from smartphones, driving higher prices for handset manufacturers. This has been especially disruptive in China, where OEMs are responding by scaling back production plans and tightening inventory management.\n\nWhile Qualcomm maintains that the fundamental demand environment for handsets remains intact, highlighting better-than-expected global shipments in the December quarter and a strong Snapdragon design win pipeline, the near-term outlook remains cautious. OEMs are adjusting build plans downward to manage cost pressures, and Qualcomm is seeing reduced chipset orders as a result.\n\nFor the second quarter, Qualcomm forecasts QCT handset revenues of $6 billion, reflecting a sharp sequential decline. While management expects QCT handset revenues to return to their prior growth trajectory once memory supply and pricing normalize. However, until visibility into memory availability improves and OEM production plans stabilize, Qualcomm’s earnings may remain under pressure. That uncertainty helps explain why the shares have continued to slide despite solid underlying execution.\n\nWhile the company’s handset revenues could continue to face near-term pressure, management has pointed to meaningful strength in other businesses.\n\nQualcomm’s QCT IoT revenue is projected to grow by a low teens percentage YoY. That growth will likely be driven by expanding demand across both industrial and consumer IoT applications. Further, the momentum in the QCT automotive business will be sustained. Qualcomm anticipates YoY revenue growth accelerating to more than 35% in the second fiscal quarter.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, QCOM stock appears inexpensive at 16.3 times forward earnings. However, that multiple fails to attract. Analysts expect QCOM’s earnings to decline 14.7% in fiscal 2026, and there is still limited visibility into a meaningful reacceleration in fiscal 2027. With handset revenues under pressure and earnings momentum weakening, Qualcomm's stock could still remain under pressure.\n\nAnalysts maintain a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating on QCOM stock. However, if memory constraints persist longer than expected, the risk of Qualcomm shares drifting toward their two-year low increases.",

      "Content": "Astera Labs ALAB shares have plunged 30.8% since it reported fourth-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday. The decline was due to a slight decrease in non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2025, which dropped 70 basis points sequentially to 75.7% compared to the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributed to a higher mix of hardware sales.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins also fell 150 basis points sequentially to 40.2%, driven by a $16 million increase in operating expenses due to the expansion of the R&D organization, including the aiXscale acquisition.\n\nALAB’s shares have also plunged 33.6% in the trailing six-month period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 10.3% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of 20.3% over the same time frame.

It benefits from strong demand for its PCIe solutions, which have also been a major growth driver.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ product portfolio, including Scorpio, Aries, and Taurus, has been a key catalyst. In the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB started increasing production of its Scorpio X-Series lead platform.\n\nThe company also expanded the Smart Fabric Switch roadmap with hyperscaler partners, adding new features to meet the needs of next-generation scale-up networking. Early interest from customers is pushing more investment into the quickly growing merchant scale-up switching market, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB expanded its product portfolio with custom NVLink Fusion connectivity solutions designed with hyperscaler partners to optimize heterogeneous AI infrastructure performance, improve energy efficiency, and reduce cost across diverse next-generation AI workloads.\n\nALAB’s expanding portfolio underpins the company’s expectation that its served addressable market opportunity will expand by more than 10x over the next five years to reach $25 billion. This growth is expected to be driven by its copper-based product families, including Aries and Taurus signal conditioning solutions, Scorpio AI fabric switches, Leo CXL Memory Controllers, and custom solutions for scale-up connectivity.\n\nAster Lab is benefiting from strong demand for its Aries, Taurus, and Scorpio product families, all of which are expected to drive growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAstera Labs expects first-quarter 2026 revenues between $286 million and $297 million. Earnings are expected to be between 53 cents and 54 cents per share for the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure calls for a year-over-year increase of 57.58%.\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Astera Labs, Inc. Quote\n\nDespite an expanding portfolio and strong partner base, ALAB is facing stiff competition from other industry players like Marvell Technology MRVL, Credo Technology CRDO, and Broadcom AVGO in the connectivity space.\n\nMarvell Technology is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. Marvell Technology recently completed its acquisition of Celestial AI, strengthening its scale-up optical connectivity capabilities for large-scale AI deployments.\n\nCredo Technology is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market with a healthy pipeline of PCIe Gen6 AECs and retimers, with further customer wins expected to support fiscal 2026 growth. Credo Technology’s shares have rallied 3.8% in the trailing six-month period.\n\nBroadcom is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market by developing advanced solutions that enhance signal quality and extend the reach of PCIe connections in high-speed data environments. Broadcom shares have surged 50.3% in the trailing 12-month period.\n\nAstera Labs’ stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 17.67X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.51X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ strong fundamentals, expanding partnerships, and rising AI demand reinforce its leadership in connectivity solutions. However, challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition remain a headwind. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.\n\nAstera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

      "Content": "Though it may not feel like it amid recent concerns surrounding technology, particularly in software and some other stocks tied to the broader AI frenzy, many in the trade are still crushing it in the new year, delivering big-time gains.\n\nAnd concerning the all-star performers, three stocks that sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER reflect the top three hottest S&P 500 stocks in 2026. What’s been driving the positivity?\n\nSanDisk shares have been melting higher in 2026 months as its role in the broader AI frenzy finally comes into focus. The stock is up more than 160% in the new year alone, by far reflecting one of the strongest moves we’ve seen.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating SNDK’s performance in 2026 relative to the broader Zacks Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI is driving a huge surge in storage demand, which is where SanDisk comes in. NAND prices are rising rapidly, with AI data centers, cloud providers, and edge devices all needing more high-speed storage.\n\nThe company’s revenue acceleration is evident in recent quarterly releases, with sales of $3.0 billion climbing 61% year-over-year throughout its latest period. Its current fiscal year (ends in June) has also confirmed the favorable demand backdrop, with the current $14.1 billion estimate up a staggering 50% over the last year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWDC shares impressively reflected one of 2025’s top-performing S&P 500 stocks as well, with the fresh year already looking bright again. Western Digital provides scalable, sustainable technology for hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers, providing cutting-edge innovation that’s expected to drive the next generation of AI-driven data workloads.\n\nUp nearly 70%, the stock has been red-hot in the fresh year, underpinned by favorable quarterly results that have revealed a massive opportunity for the company.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s cash-generating abilities have seen a nice boost thanks to the environment, with free cash flow of $653 million throughout its latest period up by a triple-digit 125%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s critical to note that Western Digital also holds roughly a 20% stake in SNDK.\n\nTeradyne manufactures equipment used by other companies to test chips. Unsurprisingly, the fastest-growing segment here is chips for AI data centers and accelerators, and more complex chips mean greater test demand, with AI chips among the most complex right now.\n\nUp 60%, the stock has enjoyed a great year so far, particularly so relative to the Zacks Technology sector, which is essentially flat YTD.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTeradyne’s sales growth has been incredible over recent periods, as shown below. Recent quarterly results came in above the high-end of previous guidance, further explaining the positivity behind shares in the new year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile pockets of the broader Technology sector, particularly software, continue to get hammered in 2026, all three above – SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER – haven’t seen hardly any negativity, with all three benefiting in a huge way either directly or indirectly from the AI demand environment.\n\nNotably, all three stocks sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-analog-devices-adi-143004519.html",
      "Content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.52 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.7% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Analog Devices, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.9% over the past month to $9.97.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices.

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending is poised to jump significantly in 2026, with a recent report from CNBC suggesting that the capital expenditures (capex) of the top four hyperscalers in the U.S. could soar to $700 billion this year. That would be a big jump over 2025's capex of $394 billion.\n\nSemiconductor companies are likely to win big from this massive outlay , as they provide the basic building blocks that enable AI training and inference. Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE) is among the semiconductor companies playing a central role in the proliferation of AI.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nShares of this company that sells optical and photonic networking components enabling high-speed transmission in AI data centers are already trading up 56% in 2026. It won't be surprising to see this stock delivering more gains this year, potentially becoming the best-performing AI chip stock of 2026.\n\nLet's see why that may be the case.\n\nLumentum released its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results (for the period ended Dec. 27, 2025) on Feb. 3. The company reported a 66% year-over-year increase in revenue to $666 million, well ahead of the $652 million Wall Street estimate. Even better, the company's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped nearly 4x year over year to $1.67 per share, crushing the $1.41-per-share consensus expectation.\n\nCEO Michael Hurlston remarked on the latest earnings call that Lumentum is playing a critical role in AI data centers:\n\nImportantly, Lumentum expects to grow at a faster pace going forward, driven by its solid backlog, new contracts, and capacity expansion plans. The company has a backlog of more than $400 million for its optical circuit switches that enable high-speed transmission in data centers.\n\nMeanwhile, the company received what it calls an incremental \"multi-hundred-million-dollar\" contract in co-packaged optics, which are deployed in custom AI processors for their higher bandwidth and energy efficiency.\n\nLumentum has been aggressively expanding capacity to meet the terrific end-market demand. It already achieved more than half of the targeted 40% capacity improvement in the previous quarter. Moreover, Lumentum plans to bring new capacity online at two of its plants in the U.K. and Japan later this year.\n\nLumentum management anticipates an 85% year-over-year increase in revenue in the current quarter to $805 million at the midpoint of its guidance range. Its adjusted earnings forecast of $2.25 per share is almost 4x the earnings it clocked in the same period last year.\n\nAnalysts expect a 263% spike in Lumentum's earnings in the current fiscal year to $7.47 per share, followed by impressive jumps over the next couple of years as well.\n\nThe company may deliver stronger growth as it brings more capacity online. That could pave the way for more upside in this technology stock, which is why investors can consider buying Lumentum before it jumps higher.",

      "Content": "蘋果公司 (AAPL-US) 近期在確保尖端半導體方面陷入苦戰，全球最大的代工企業台積電 (TSM-US)(2330-TW) 的產能不足，正在成為 iPhone 增產的瓶頸。而蘋果也失去做為第一大客戶的特殊優勢。\n此前超過 15 年，蘋果一直是台積電「優先客戶」，享有最先進製程的首發權與議價優勢。然而，隨著人工智慧基礎設施需求的爆炸式增長，這場權力結構正發生根本性轉變。在 2025 年，輝達 (NVDA-US) 已經超越蘋果，正式成為台積電營收貢獻度最高的客戶。\n輝達崛起與產能爭奪戰 數據顯示，輝達 2026 財年的增長率高達 62%，相較之下，蘋果的產品營收增長僅為 3.6%。台積電 2025 年的營收成長幾乎完全由高效能運算 (HPC) 驅動，市場預計， 2026 年輝達將占台積電營收份額的 20%，領先蘋果的 16%。\n這場權力轉移不僅體現在營收數字上，更是一場物理上的「矽晶圓爭奪戰」。一顆輝達 Blackwell 或 Rubin GPU 的晶粒面積超過 800 平方公釐，而蘋果 A20 晶片僅約 100 至 120 平方公釐。這意味著，每生產一顆輝達 GPU，就會消耗相當於 6 到 8 顆 iPhone 晶片的物理空間。\n據報導，截至 2026 年 1 月，台積電的 2 奈米產能已達到每月 50,000 片以上晶圓。台積電計畫在 2026 年年底前，將 2 奈米的月產能進一步提升至 120,000 至 140,000 片。儘管產能持續增加，但 2 奈米的所有產能目前已處於全數售罄的狀態，客戶甚至需要支付比 3 奈米高出 50% 的溢價 (每片晶圓約 3 萬美元) 來爭奪產量。\n當台積電產能滿載時，這便成了一場零和競爭，而願意支付高額溢價的 AI 客戶顯然更具優勢。\n議價優勢喪失與前所未有的漲價壓力 媒體報導，台積電執行長魏哲家於 2025 年 8 月親自造訪蘋果加州總部，傳達了一個關鍵訊號：蘋果將面臨「多年來最大幅度的漲價」，且不再享有保證產能的特權。\n過去蘋果憑藉龐大且穩定的訂單，能換取最優惠的製造條件，但如今台積電的產能分配更像是一場拍賣會，由利潤更高、成長更快的 AI 客戶取勝。\n台積電 2025 年第四季毛利率高達 62.3%，已接近軟體公司的水準，反映出其在供不應求環境下的強大議價力。\n蘋果的戰略調整 面對產能受限與成本攀升，蘋果採取了 15 年來首次的重大策略轉向。蘋果已宣布與英特爾 (INTC-US) 達成代工合作，預計在 2027 年將入門級 M 系列晶片 (如 MacBook Air 所用) 轉往 Intel 18A 製程生產，以規避單一供應鏈風險並緩解對台積電的依賴。\n同時，雙方的競爭火線已延伸至「先進封裝」領域。隨著蘋果 M5、M6 系列晶片導入 Chiplet 模組化設計並尋求 CoWoS 封裝架構，蘋果將與輝達在台積電 AP6 與 AP7 等 3D 先進封裝產線上「正面對撞」。業界普遍認為，未來幾年半導體產業的核心戰略將進入「封裝為王」的時代。",

      "Content": "當股價一路刷新歷史高點，投資人往往在「錯過恐懼」與「追高焦慮」之間拉扯。蛇年封關日，台積電（2330）盤中一度觸及1925元，終場收在1915元，再度改寫收盤新高。面對逼近2000元整數關卡的價位，市場開始出現觀望氣氛。\n然而美國知名財經媒體《The Motley Fool》特約分析師Jennifer Saibil卻給出截然不同的看法。她以「像明天就是世界末日般買進」為題，直言即便股價大漲，台積電對長期投資人而言仍具吸引力，並提出三項核心理由。\n首先，她指出台積電的價值不僅建立在AI熱潮之上。雖然高效能運算（HPC）目前已占營收約58%，AI相關需求更是市場焦點，但台積電真正的優勢在於其「長期不可取代性」。從智慧型手機、遊戲主機到人工智慧運算，公司始終與全球科技龍頭合作，成為關鍵晶片代工夥伴。科技趨勢不斷輪替，但台積電幾乎都站在供應鏈核心位置，使其不易因單一題材退燒而失速。\n▼蛇年封關日，台積電（2330）盤中一度觸及1925元，終場收在1915元，再度改寫收盤新高。（示意圖／東森新聞資料照）\n第二，針對市場對資本支出增加的疑慮，分析師認為這反而是成長前兆。台積電2025年第四季毛利率達62.3%，營業利益率54%，展現強勁的獲利能力與定價權。歷史經驗顯示，每逢公司進入新一輪擴產與設備投資週期後，往往伴隨營收與獲利顯著提升。換言之，資本支出上升未必是壓力，而可能是為未來訂單預作準備。\n第三，也是外媒特別強調的一點，是估值面仍具吸引力。儘管台積電ADR過去一年漲幅達61%，但若對照第四季營收年增26%、每股盈餘成長35%的基本面，目前預期本益比約18倍。以其在全球半導體產業的領先地位與長期成長潛力來看，該水準並未顯得過度昂貴。\n▼從外媒分析角度觀察，台積電的競爭優勢與財務表現，仍被視為支撐長期價值的重要基礎。（示意圖／東森新聞資料照）\n在市場情緒逐漸升溫之際，華爾街的聲音反而顯得冷靜且樂觀。股價創高是否意味著短線風險升高，仍取決於投資人自身策略與風險承受度。不過從外媒分析角度觀察，台積電的競爭優勢與財務表現，仍被視為支撐長期價值的重要基礎。\n（封面圖／東森新聞）",

That's easier said than done right now. Too many stocks have demonstrated a bit too much vulnerability of late. Another wave of weakness feels possible.\n\nNot every name is uncomfortably risky here, however. Even if the market does get upended again, a few stocks are apt to hold up well enough and then enjoy more than their fair share of any recovery. Here's a rundown of three of these names.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nQualcomm 's (NASDAQ: QCOM) 23% share price pullback from its early January peak makes enough superficial sense. Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\n\nPayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\n\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\n\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\n\nFinally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\n\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) has been one of the hottest stocks in the market, but a 14% pullback from highs hit in early February could be a buying opportunity. And despite its recent highs, the stock is still not expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15 times analyst estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) and just over 7.5 times fiscal 2027 estimates.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe company is a leading producer of NAND storage devices, or flash memory. It is one of the few pure-play ways to invest in this segment of the tech market after the company was spun off from Western Digital about a year ago. NAND has been a very cyclical market over the years, but the space looks like it is at the beginning of what appears to be a long-lasting supercycle.\n\nIt was only a few years ago that the NAND market was in complete disarray. After seeing huge demand for electronics stemming from the pandemic, memory makers overbuilt production, causing a huge oversupply in the market that led prices to crash. Things became so bad that NAND gross margins turned negative.\n\nThis disarray led many memory makers to hugely cut NAND production and redirect their focus to DRAM (dynamic random access memory). At the same time, the introduction of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized form of DRAM, began to take off because of its importance in helping optimize the performance of graphics processing units when running artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. HBM comes with strong unit economics, but it needs huge wafer capacity, so it began eating up memory maker resources.\n\nSoon after, AI data centers also started to need huge, high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs) that use NAND to help store training data. With production slashed and demand now suddenly surging, flash memory prices have been skyrocketing because there is now a huge NAND shortage. Given the economics and demand for HBM, along with growing demand for NAND, these market dynamics are unlikely to shift anytime in the near future.\n\nWith flash memory in short supply, Sandisk continues to benefit from increased prices, which are also dramatically lifting its gross margins and profits. Last quarter, its revenue jumped 61%, while its gross margins expanded from 32.3% a year ago to 50.9%, leading its adjusted earnings per share to surge fivefold.\n\nWith the NAND market going from a cyclical business to a structural growth story on the back of AI data centers, Sandisk finds itself in an enviable position. And with the boom in AI infrastructure spending, the company is set to see huge growth ahead. This makes the recent dip a buying opportunity.",

This lesser-known chip stock seems to hold significant potential.\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\nPfizer Reports Strong Earnings Outlook - Unusual Call Options Activity Shows Investors are Bullish\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nSTMicroelectronics recently announced a partnership with Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS), and this multi-billion-dollar collaboration underscores the point of scope for value creation. As part of the deal, STM will be a supplier of advanced semiconductor technologies and products to AWS. Further, STM will issue warrants to AWS for up to 24.8 million shares. Besides establishing credibility, this deal is likely to be a top-line growth driver for STMicroelectronics and STM stock.\n\nBased in the Netherlands and headquartered in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics is a designer, developer, and manufacturer of semiconductor products globally. The company’s key business segments include RF & Optical Communications, Analog Products, MEMS & Sensors, Embedded Processing, and Power & Discrete Products. In terms of end users, the automotive, industrial and personal electronics segments are business growth drivers for the company.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, STMicroelectronics reported revenue of $11.8 billion with a gross margin of 33.9%. For the same period, the firm reported free cash flow of $265 million.\n\nWhile STMicroelectronics reported revenue degrowth in fiscal 2025, SMT stock has trended higher by 28% in the last six months, in part due to a positive long-term outlook backed by key strategic partnerships.\n\nWhile revenue degrowth is a concern, STM stock has been in an uptrend. After all, the company has multiple growth catalysts in the next few years. The partnership with AWS is one growth trigger. Similarly, the company’s chip supply to SpaceX for Starlink is expected to double in the next two years.\n\nSTM has also indicated that revenue from silicon carbide power devices is expected to return to 2024 levels by next year. This is after a contraction in revenue in 2025. Further, the firm is targeting data center revenue of $1 billion before the end of the decade.\n\nIn another important development in December 2025, the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed a €500 million financing agreement with the company. This is the initial tranche for a €1 billion credit line that’s intended to boost Europe’s competitiveness in the semiconductor sector. According to the agreement, 60% of the funds will be utilized toward “high-volume manufacturing capabilities” within Europe while 40% will be dedicated to research & development activities. These investments are likely to translate into growth and provide STM with an innovation edge, especially with the emphasis on R&D.\n\nGiven the ratings of 17 analysts, STM stock is a consensus “Moderate Buy.” While eight analysts assign a “Strong Buy” rating to STM, another eight have a “Hold\" rating while one analyst has a bearish “Strong Sell” rating.\n\nBased on these opinions, STM stock has a mean price target of $33.25 currently, implying potential downside of 1% from current levels. However, the most bullish price target of $45 suggests that STM could rise as much as 34% from here.\n\nOne important point to note is that STM stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 times. With analysts estimating earnings growth of 100% and 68% for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively, shares will likely remain in an uptrend.",

      "Title": "What Makes Monolithic Power (MPWR) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-monolithic-power-mpwr-strong-170004817.html",
      "Content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In \"long context,\" investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Monolithic Power (MPWR) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monolithic Power currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MPWR that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor MPWR, shares are up 9.4% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is up 7.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.67% compares favorably with the industry's 11.65% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Monolithic Power have increased 35.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 71.09% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.65% and 15.6%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of MPWR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now MPWR is averaging 710,006 shares for the last 20 days..\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MPWR.\n\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPWR's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.91 to $21.63 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPWR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Monolithic Power on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThursday, Feb. 12, 2026 at 8:00 a.m. ET\n\nChief Executive Officer — Jihan Wu\n\nChief Business Officer — Haris Basit\n\nChief Financial Officer — Matt Linghui Kong\n\nHaris will provide a high-level overview of Bitdeer Technologies Group's fourth quarter 2025 results and discuss the company's strategy, provide a detailed business update, and review the financial results for the quarter. Jihan, Matt, and Haris will be available for questions after the formal remarks. To accompany today's call, we have provided a supplemental investor presentation available on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s investor relations website under Webcasts and Presentations. Before management begins their formal remarks, I would like to remind everyone that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.\n\nFor a more complete discussion on forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties related to Bitdeer Technologies Group's business, please refer to the company's filings with the SEC. In addition to discussing results calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, we will also reference certain non-IFRS financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit and loss. For more detailed information on our non-IFRS financial measures, please refer to our earnings release published earlier today, which can be found on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s IR website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Haris. Thank you, John, and good day, everyone.\n\nHaris Basit: It is great to be with you today. The 2025 marked a defining period of execution and strategic progress for Bitdeer Technologies Group. Achieved critical milestones across our three strategic pillars, and position the company for sustained growth as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company. I will start with a brief overview of our financial performance for the quarter. Fourth quarter total revenue reached $225,000,000, up 226% year over year and 33% sequentially. Gross profit totaled $10,600,000, adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000 for the quarter.\n\nWhile both metrics declined sequentially, the results primarily reflect a combination of lower average Bitcoin pricing, modestly higher electricity costs, substantially higher depreciation expense due to the rapid expansion of our self-mining capacity, and further investment in new talent to support our growing AI HPC initiatives. I will discuss these factors in greater detail later in the call. Let me begin with a brief review of our power and infrastructure portfolio. We continue to make meaningful progress during the quarter, advancing a global portfolio of sites that we believe are well suited to support both large-scale Bitcoin mining and next-generation AI and HPC workloads.\n\nAcross regions, our focus remains on developing power-rich, capital-efficient infrastructure that provides flexibility, speed to market, and long-term strategic optionality. From an energy infrastructure perspective, execution during the quarter remained on track. At the January, we had over 1.66 gigawatts of capacity online, and a total global power pipeline of three gigawatts. We believe this represents one of the most attractive and AI-suitable power portfolios in the industry and provides us with a vast opportunity as the demand for such capacity continues to grow. Over the past several months, have seen a significant shift in market dynamics around AI data center development.\n\nDemand for large-scale colocation capacity has increased substantially and we have responded by refining our approach to better align with this opportunity. Therefore, we are currently prioritizing colocation services provided to Norway and the United States that are suitable for large-scale AI HPC deployments. Let me walk through a few sites and where we stand with our development plans. First, Teadle, Norway, represents our most near-term colocation opportunity. This 225-megawatt facility was originally constructed to Tier III data center specifications, which puts us in a favorable position for conversion to AI workloads.\n\nWe estimate the retrofit will require much less incremental capital expenditure to add uninterruptible power supply systems, backup batteries, and generation, as well as some additional cooling capacity compared to industry benchmarks for greenfield Tier III data center development, which typically run in the $8,000,000 to $12,000,000 per megawatt range. The site benefits from hydropower with attractive economics; independent 100-megawatt transformers provide redundancy. We are currently in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expect to be in a position to announce a signed lease agreement for Teadle as soon as possible in 2026, although the exact timing is very difficult to predict.\n\nThis site should be capable of supporting initial test GPU deployment late 2026 and first production GPUs expected in early 2027. Second, our 570-megawatt site in Clarington represents one of the larger AI data center development opportunities in the United States. Have made progress on two fronts here. First, the local utility has accelerated our interconnection timeline. Second, we are currently in discussion with multiple prospective tenants. These are well recognizable companies in the space, and the discussions are progressing. While litigation has recently been filed that could potentially delay development at this location, believe that we have meritorious claims and a strong defense and will pursue an expedient solution.\n\nGiven the scale of this site, even a partial or first phase lease would represent a significant milestone for Bitdeer Technologies Group and would provide substantial contracted revenue while derisking our development capital. Third, at Rockdale, we are pursuing a strategy that allows us to maintain our current Bitcoin mining operations while developing new HPC capacity. We are evaluating the acquisition of adjacent land to our existing facility we could potentially construct a purpose-built HPC data center. This approach would minimize disruption during data center development to our 563-megawatt mining operation, which continues to generate revenue. The greenfield HPC build would be designed from the ground up for AI workloads.\n\nThe Rockdale site benefits from its location in the ERCOT market, provides operational flexibility. We are currently talking with prospective colocation tenants for this site. The dual-track approach, maintaining Bitcoin mining while developing HPC capacity, reflects our commitment to both businesses and our ability to optimize our power portfolio across use cases. While we are prioritizing colocation for our larger sites, continue to see opportunity in GPU-as-a-service for targeted markets. We are expanding our cloud platform in Malaysia by 10 to 15 megawatts, building on the success we have had in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming sectors who need fully managed orchestrated infrastructure.\n\nIn the United States, we are planning to add 10 megawatts of GPU capacity in Washington state and are evaluating a partial conversion of our Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud. I want to be clear that the scale of our long-term US GPU-as-a-service expansion is predicated on signing customer contracts. Do not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. Expect all major GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customers who are seeking meaningful capacity with comprehensive managed services. This disciplined approach ensures we are deploying capital we have revenue certainty. A key element of our strategy is how we are approaching data center development.\n\nWe have built an internal development team with experience in very large data center construction and we are augmenting that team through strategic hires, working with experienced EPC contractors and general contractors on a fee basis rather than through joint venture arrangements. This gives us greater control over timelines and specifications, and importantly, it allows us to retain more of the economic value these assets generate. As we look ahead, the growth will continue to be anchored by our three strategic pillars, between mining, ASIC development, and HPC AI. Together, these represent a vertically integrated, highly defensible platform that leverages our deep technology expertise, proprietary chip design capabilities, and extensive global power portfolio.\n\nThe supply-demand imbalance for AI compute continues to widen, and we expect this shortage to persist well into 2027. Time to power is a critical variable, and we believe Bitdeer Technologies Group is exceptionally well positioned to serve customers seeking both near-term and midterm capacity. On the Bitcoin mining side, the rapid expansion of our self-mining platform continues. We exited the year with more than 55 exahash per second of self-mining hash rate, and in the month of January alone, we brought another eight exahash per second online, exiting the month of January at over 63 exahash per second. This firmly establishes Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miners by total hash rate under management.\n\nSupported by the disciplined rollout of our SealMiner fleet, accelerated deployment of SealMiner rigs has driven material improvements in fleet-wide efficiency. The SealMiner A2 and A3 being actively deployed in our self-mining business operate at approximately 15 to 16.5 joules per terahash and 12.5 to 14 joules per terahash respectively, and represent industry-leading power efficiency. As these next-generation rigs replace legacy third-party equipment, our blended fleet efficiency continues to improve, with our overall fleet-wide efficiency currently standing at 17.5 joules per terahash as of 01/31/2026. As SealMiner penetration increases throughout 2026, we expect our overall fleet-wide efficiency to continue to improve, enhancing our mining margins. Looking ahead, our self-mining operations are not plateauing.\n\nOur investments in chip design are delivering tangible results. During the quarter, we commenced mass production of the SealMiner A3 series. Initial shipments began in November, and we have deployed a total of 8.7 exahash of our SealMiner A3 to date. As we continue to retire older-generation third-party rigs, we expect the A3 series to continue to meaningfully contribute to our fleet efficiency improvements and growth throughout 2026. On the R&D front, our CLO4-1 chip was completed back in September. The CLO4-1 represents a meaningful step forward in efficiency and positions Bitdeer Technologies Group to maintain technological leadership as the industry continues its relentless drive towards lower power consumption per unit of hash rate.\n\nMass production of mining rigs based on the CLO4-1 chip will begin in Q1 2026. CLO4-2 chip design remains under development at our US-based design center. Additionally, we have successfully taped out a new Litecoin chip, SEAL-DL1, designed for Doge and Litecoin mining. The initial test results of SEAL-DL1 have exceeded comparable rigs in both energy efficiency and hash rate. On the recent market conditions, the CLDL1 generates higher fiat-based returns per megawatt than our SealMiner A2. Preparation for USA SealMiner manufacturing remains in progress. This initiative is a core component of our vertically integrated strategy and aligns with both operational resilience objectives and evolving trade and supply chain dynamics.\n\nNow let me walk through our detailed financial results for the quarter. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that all figures I refer to today are in US dollars. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $224,800,000, up 225.8% year over year and up 32.5% sequentially. The year-over-year growth and sequential growth in revenue was primarily driven by significantly higher self-mining hash rate as a result of continued CLMiner deployment, as well as contributions from SealMiner sales, offset in part by slightly lower Bitcoin prices for the quarter. Self-mining revenue was $168,600,000, compared to $41,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $130,900,000 in Q3 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 306% and a sequential growth of 28.7%.\n\nContinued growth from Q3 2025 levels reflects a significant increase in average operating hash rate and associated Bitcoin production during the quarter, offset in part by 13% lower average Bitcoin prices quarter on quarter. SealMiner sales revenue was $23,400,000, up 105.4% over the $11,400,000 reported in Q3 2025. Total gross profit for the quarter was $10,600,000, reflecting a gross margin of 4.7%, versus 7.4% in Q4 2024 and $40,800,000 or 24.1% in Q3 2025. Significant decline in gross margin reflects the combined impact of several drivers during the quarter. First, obviously, we experienced 13% lower Bitcoin prices during the quarter along with the gradual increase of the global hash rate.\n\nSecond, on the cost side, experienced an approximately 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit during the quarter when compared to Q3 2025, mainly due to the seasonal winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites. Third, the growth in our self-mining hash rate comes with a concurrent noncash depreciation expense associated with this fleet of new miners. Additionally, during the quarter, we changed our methodology for calculating depreciation expense to reflect a more conservative approach. Now depreciate rigs using a three-year straight-line method versus our prior assumption of a five-year depreciable life for hardware. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $66,300,000 compared to $42,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $60,500,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following factors compared to Q3. We added more headcount to support both mining site operations and our AI infrastructure expansion, incurred additional holiday season compensation, along with an increase in year-end general corporate activities. These expenditures reflect the operational requirements of our growing infrastructure footprint and the resources necessary to execute on our strategic initiatives. Other operating expenses for the quarter was $43,800,000 compared to $3,700,000 in Q4 2024 and other operating income of $26,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to the fair value change of Bitcoins pledged for the Bitcoin-collateralized loan since Q3 2025.\n\nOther net gain for the quarter was $208,900,000 compared to other net loss of $4 and $79,800,000 in Q4 2024 and $238,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to noncash fair value change of derivative liabilities related to the convertible senior notes issued in November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025. Adjusted net loss was $82,600,000 versus $37,400,000 in Q4 2024 and $36,300,000 in Q3 2025. The increase in loss was primarily due to higher energy and depreciation costs, higher operating and interest expense, partially offset by the year-over-year higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000, versus negative $4,300,000 in Q4 2024 and positive $39,600,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential decline was primarily driven by higher energy costs and higher operating expenses attributed to salaries and wages for recent additions to our headcount, as well as a number of elevated costs associated with year-end holiday allowance and year-end general corporate activities. To provide a better sense of our G&A expense on a run-rate basis, our Q4 2025 results reflect approximately $3,000,000 of salary, wage, and benefits expense which will largely be recurring, as well as another $6,000,000 to $7,000,000 in consulting, legal, and travel expenses which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was $599,500,000, primarily driven by SealMiner supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs from the mining business, general corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97,900,000, which includes $50,700,000 of capital expenditures relating to data center infrastructure construction, GPU equipment procurement, and tariffs and freight for mining rigs delivered to the data centers, and $150,600,000 of proceeds from the disposal of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the quarter $454,500,000, which resulted primarily from $388,500,000 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $168,000,000 in borrowings from a related party, and $141,500,000 of proceeds from shares sold under our ATM and ELOC program, free offset by $171,100,000 of repayments of borrowings. For the full calendar year 2025, capital expenditures for the continued build out of our global power and data center infrastructure totaled $176,000,000. Looking to full year 2026, we anticipate total infrastructure spend in the range of $180,000,000 to $200,000,000 for crypto mining data center construction.\n\nPlease note that this guidance covers power and crypto mining data center infrastructure only and does not include CapEx for SealMiners and GPU. AI cloud and colocation capital expenditures are also not included. Turning to our balance sheet and financial position. We exited the year with $149,400,000 in cash and cash equivalents, $83,100,000 in cryptocurrencies, held at cost less impairment, $135,600,000 in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1,000,000,000 in borrowings excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities were $501,100,000, relate to the November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025 convertible senior notes.\n\nThis represents $171,400,000 reduction compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a noncash fair value adjustment driven by the change in our stock price and settlement for partial principal of November 2024 convertible senior notes. As I mentioned earlier, this does not impact our liquidity or operations. Regarding our outstanding ATM and ELOC facility, we received approximately $143,600,000 in gross proceeds during the quarter. Approximately 6,700,000 additional shares issued. We have exercised disciplined capital allocation throughout the year using the ATM and ELOC opportunistically to support our growth initiative while minimizing dilution.\n\nAs a final note to our financial update, we wish to note that starting in Q1 2026, we will begin to use GAAP instead of IFRS as our accounting standard. In summary, we are proud of our team's execution this quarter and throughout 2025. I want to express my deep pride what our team has accomplished this year. Established Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the world's largest publicly listed Bitcoin mining operators by total hash rate under management. Our leadership position in self-mining and our proprietary SealMiner technology provide multiple paths to value creation that few, if any, competitors can match.\n\nOur pipeline of developed and contracted power capacity gives us a meaningful competitive edge in serving a variety of customers. The colocation opportunity ahead of us is immense, we are pursuing it proactively. We enter 2026 with strong operational momentum, a differentiated asset base, and a team that has proven its ability to execute at scale. Excited about what lies ahead and remain committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, Operator. Please open the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open for questions. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press *11 and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press *11 again. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Giles of B. Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nNick Giles: Yes. Thank you so much, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Haris, really appreciate the comprehensive update, especially on the colocation side. And my first question was just, and I am sure you are speaking to a range of customers, and you know, at this point of negotiations or discussions, what is really the main items that are being discussed? Is it down to price, duration, timing? There is still a lot of work ongoing around design. Just any additional color on where you stand in the process.\n\nHaris Basit: It is different with different potential counterparties, and we are all of those things that you mentioned are being discussed, maybe not with the same counterparty, but you know, I hesitate to say too much about these discussions. They are sensitive, and you know, very active at this time. So you know, we feel pretty confident that we are going to get colocation deals done in the near future. Predicting that time frame is going to be hard. And, you know, the discussions are pretty intense with several counterparties.\n\nNick Giles: No. Understood. That is helpful, and just my second question was, we think about financing, you made some important comments there on having a larger share of the economics. But should we be expecting in terms of debt cost of capital and what kind of credit enhancements are you looking at, if any?\n\nHaris Basit: Cost of capital for these projects, for the colocation projects, will be very much determined by the counterparties and exact terms of the deal. So I think that is hard to predict right now until we, you know, announce which of these deals are done with which counterparties. Was that responsive to your question? I am not sure if that is what you were.\n\nNick Giles: Asking.\n\nHaris Basit: I mean, that is an important part of any deal. And, you know, it is because it does determine the cost of development to a large extent. And so we are, you know, we are looking at many different approaches here. It is a very important part of getting the deal done right. So it is something that we are focusing on as well. I cannot really say which ones are better or worse. It depends a lot on the counterparty, and it depends on, you know, there is a number of ways to do this. Most of them have been already done in the Marketplace.\n\nAnd know, I do not think you will see anything too dramatically different from those when we announce.\n\nNick Giles: Got it. Understood. Well, again, I appreciate the update, and continue. Best of luck.\n\nJihan Wu: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Colonnese of H.C. Wainwright & Co. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Colonnese: Today. First one for me on the infrastructure piece. It sounds like you are pretty far along in negotiations for a potential colo deal at the Teadle site. Curious what type of customers you are in discussions with specifically at that campus. And, Haris, if I heard correctly, it sounds like the full retrofit for the 225 megs could be completed by the end of this year. There a PUE you guys are assuming that number? I know it is built with Tier III standards in mind, but any additional color would be helpful there.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is correct. We do expect completion of that Teadle Norway site in at the end of this year and then installation of production GPUs at the beginning of next year. And the PUE at that site is actually very low, which is one of the biggest advantages of that site. It is, you know, it is 100% hydropower. It is a nice cold climate. And there is chilled water available from a nearby lake. So the PUE there, for estimation purposes, is around 1.1. It is dramatically better than most locations.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. And then, the typical customer profile for that site specific, I know you are in discussions with the range of customers across the portfolio. I would be just curious with that international facility, the type of customers you are looking at.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, there is some difference, but, you know, there is still a lot of overlap with the customers there versus customers in the United States. So but, you know, I really do not want to say too much about who we are talking to and the exact nature of those deals. They are fairly sensitive negotiations at this point. Understood. Understood. And then as it relates to the Bitcoin mining business, you guys are one of the few public miners that continue to rapidly expand your self-mining capacity. How should we think about growth in this business in 2026? Particularly as you look to pursue these AI infrastructure deals across parts of the portfolio?\n\nHaris Basit: So one thing to say is that we are long-term believers in Bitcoin. And, of course, Bitcoin is in a little bit of a down cycle right now. But long term, we believe in Bitcoin. And we will continue to invest in our Bitcoin mining capacity. We have not given any projections for what the total hash rate for our company might be by the end of this year or in any future quarter yet. We are still evaluating that and we may project that at a later time. But at this time, we do not have any projections to share publicly for future growth of our hash rate.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. Thanks for the color, Haris, and best of luck with these opportunities.\n\nOperator: Thank you, Mike. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on all this capacity you have activated. But maybe along those lines that was asked before, with the lower Bitcoin prices, is there a price where you slow your mining activity because costs are higher versus what the hash price would be?\n\nHaris Basit: I am sure there is such a price, so we just have not reached it yet. So you know, our efficiency of our fleet keeps improving. And, so it also, you know, as price goes down, it be the entire fleet. Some parts of the fleet, you know, because of the efficiency and because of the energy price at that location, can continue to operate for quite some, you know, in quite some even further decrease beyond here. And then you will, some of the older machines that have been around for several years, those could be turned off first. Right? In fact, just in our normal upgrade cycle, we will be replacing those.\n\nSo there is, you know, we have not reached that point now, and I do not anticipate that we will. But, you know, of course, there is such a price. It is just much lower than what we are at now.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. That is good information. I guess as you keep lowering your costs, then you can handle lower Bitcoin prices. But just as another topic, is the GPU-as-a-service, is there a good market for the, say, N minus one GPU clusters rather than spending money on the very leading edge of GPUs? Is there still a need for GPU-as-a-service for the older GPUs?\n\nHaris Basit: Yes. There is. We are, though, however, typically pursuing the latest and greatest GPUs. But I mean, we still get demand for, you know, even our oldest H100s that we have in Singapore.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi of ROTH. Your line is now open.\n\nDarren Aftahi: Yes, good morning. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Haris, could you dive a little bit more into sort of the scale and scope of the hires you have made for digital infrastructure towards the end of the year that you spoke to, and then kind of the cadence of continued investment in maybe Q1 and into 2026? I guess, at what point do you feel like you have an adequate team to kind of attack this opportunity?\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, we are very pleased with some of our recent hires. We have hired people with direct expertise in AI, in cloud services. And a lot of those folks have been in the United States, but also in Asia. The team is, you know, the number of people dedicated to this has grown dramatically. I do not think I have an exact number. But we continue to hire. I do not think we have reached, you know, a place where we think we have enough folks yet. But we are still looking for people, especially on the side of the engineering part of building data centers with still open racks there. So no.\n\nI expect that we will continue to hire throughout the year. And a lot of those folks will be in the United States. But, you know, we have also done significant AI hiring in Asia.\n\nDarren Aftahi: Got it. And then same question on the Rockdale site is sort of twofold. In terms of land acquisition for that, kind of where are you, and what is the timeline on process? And then I know Oncor is supposed to put another substation in, and I think you guys have spoken to additional capacity there. I think it is in the 100-some plus megawatts. But in light of kind of the seesaw that is going on with ERCOT and decision on batching, just kind of curious about your thoughts about prospects of Rockdale actually growing as a site. Thanks.\n\nHaris Basit: The recent, you know, information around ERCOT and power allocation in that region, we do not believe that applies to the growth at Rockdale. So the 179, up to 179 megawatts that we anticipate we could add there, should not be affected by that. And I say it that way because, of course, we do not know what the exact regulations will be. They are just still under discussion. So we do expect that we will get most of that, if not all of that additional capacity. The land acquisition there is moving forward. You know, it is not done until it is done, but we are, we are, yeah.\n\nI am not sure how to characterize where we are in that process, but, you know, we are actively pursuing it. And we expect that we will finish it. But until we do, it is hard to say exactly when that is going to happen. Great. Appreciate the insights. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Greg Lewis of BTIG. Your line is now open.\n\nGreg Lewis: Hey. Thank you, and good morning. Good open. Hey, I guess first, I mean, on published numbers, I guess you guys are the bitcoin miner of the listed companies by XFASH. So congrats on that. I did want to talk a little bit about the GPU business. You noted about potential expanse. You should a mouthful. The potential expansion in Malaysia. Know, just kind of curious, is that infrastructure that we are building, are we leasing? And then just kind of how should we think about, you know, the rollout of that, I guess, I think you mentioned 15 megawatts in Malaysia for the GPUs.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is infrastructure that we are leasing. I welcome Matt or Jihan to add to that. They want. But what was the second part of your question? How should we think about the rollout of bringing those 15 megawatts online and generating revenue from that? I mean, we have proactively purchased some, I think, the GB200 NVL72 and installed it just recently there. So that is in place right now. In terms of additional machines there, do not think we have made any announcements at present. So that is actually.\n\nGreg Lewis: Okay. But it is, but it sounds like it sounds like we could start seeing revenue maybe in the second quarter, and then maybe that scales up sequentially for a couple of quarters?\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I think, John and Matt are closer to that than I am. So I do not know if, is that a, is that a correct statement that you have?\n\nJihan Wu: I think we will be able to deploy GPUs into those infrastructures at the fourth quarter or third quarter of this year. It depends on when that infrastructure will be ready. We will no tests. It will be ready around June. But, and maybe there will be one or two month delays. So I sent 2024 can be more conservative estimation.\n\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Super helpful. Alright. Hey, everybody. Thanks for the time, and have a great day.\n\nJihan Wu: Thank you, Greg.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Todaro: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question and the all the extra hash, bro. I guess, can we just get a bit more color on Clarrington? Like, do you need litigation results before signing an HPC customer there? You view that differently. Maybe any guardrails on timeline there? And then I have a follow-up on the mining piece.\n\nHaris Basit: So because it is litigation, we have to be sort of, you know, more careful in what we say here. You know, our attorneys feel very strongly that we have a very good case here, and the litigation has little merit, and we will, you know, prevail here. And on the business side, we are, you know, exploring alternative that can mitigate the impact of the litigation. I do not really want to say a lot more than that. You know, as we said in our scripted remarks, we do anticipate that there will be, you know, some potential delay. But, you know, we are still confident in the site overall.\n\nBut it is early days, and we, you know, we are looking at some significant alternatives.\n\nJihan Wu: Yeah. I think the alternative, alternative here, we have multiple alternative options. Creating alternative options is to solve those problems. I believe it is very critical solving those problems. And at a company level, Clarrington, Rockdale, and our lower chin size, we would be able to have lots of alternatives. Other than Carrington. This is the company level. And under the Clariton level, we believe we have several solutions. So I do not think that we are really caught at this kind of litigation.\n\nJohn Todaro: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then on the that latest tape out for the Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, do you anticipate mining some of these other assets? Alongside Bitcoin? And maybe I was looking at some of the margin profile. It looks like there is still some margin there. But maybe the opportunity in those as well.\n\nJihan Wu: Well, I think 99% or 98% will still be Bitcoin mining. This autochrome mining operations cannot really be scalable very much due to the market cap. So we count into a very small size operations. But on those, on those capacity, we deploy those manual rates yield out of from those capacity will be significantly improved. So I think it is worth the effort to add some, add some. And then, by the way, this is our first b commanding chip and the manual machines that are designed and manufactured totally depends on our Singapore and the Malaysia office. And the Malaysia operation as well. Malaysia operation, we started to build since last year or earlier.\n\nI think that this product, it also means that our supply chain center in Malaysia has been quite mature. So Malaysia and Vietnam, we will have two supply chain center. For companies. Think it is very strategic and important for the resilience of our business in the future.\n\nHaris Basit: Understood. That is helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Thanks, John.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Knoblauch of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\n\nBrett Knoblauch: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe now that we are several weeks into the year, I am curious if you have any insights into what wafer allocation is going to look like this year compared to last year? And on the back of that, with Bitcoin price coming down, network cash staying resilient, hash price going to kind of near all-time lows, does that, you know, more incentivize you guys to use manufacturing capacity for, call it, internal use rather than sell external? Or how should we kind of look at the split between what you guys manufacture for yourselves Versus sell this year? Thank you.\n\nJihan Wu: We cannot tell the exact number or situation with the different allocation, but we have a really good relationships. And even though the we all know that the demand for AI business is huge, several times. Then take them to rehab, but we will get some co coda from additional capacity. And the hash price drops to historically due now recently. And it became very difficult for sending the money works with profit. But we have our own capacities or electricity cost is one of the lowest on the market. And our CapEx, so perhaps combined together, we are the lowest on the market.\n\nSo our self money definitely became kind of very defensive, very safe strategy for our companies to make sure that even though in this kind of environment, our Bitcoin mining operations will be profitable. So self deployment will be a very important strategy in 2006, especially in the kind of a very bearish marketplace. I think our market share for the Bitcoin mining output will continue to grow. Into something.\n\nHaris Basit: Perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl of Northland. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Grondahl: Hey, thank you. Hey, Haris, I just wanted to ask, on the November call, there was a significant emphasis on, you know, GPU rental, and that is what Bitdeer Technologies Group wanted to do. And now it seems like you are adjusting that a little bit on some of the larger sites, you know, colocation. Can you just talk about pivot away or why you are seemingly deemphasizing GPU rental at some of those large sites?\n\nHaris Basit: Maybe, Jihan, do you want to do that answer first, and then I can chime in if there is still.\n\nJihan Wu: Yes. I as an on the very live site, colocation is kind of very natural and good choice for a company. And for GPU rental, we have a smaller size Washington State and Tennessee State. We can absolutely handle that ourselves. And maybe a larger capacitors for a lot of interest is besides, like, 10 megawatts or 50 megawatts. They want the nitrocytes anyway, and the nitrocytes in before company better to have some coefficient deal.\n\nHaris Basit: Do you have another question, Mike?\n\nMike Grondahl: No. So hey. Just so I understand, you have just sort of the larger sites, you will go colocation. The smaller ones, you go GPU rental. I guess that was kinda my takeaway. Is that fair?\n\nHaris Basit: Yes. That is correct. Got it.\n\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line Steven Glagola of KBW. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Glagola: Hey, thanks for the question. I have two. First for Haris. I would like to clarify whether Bitdeer Technologies Group’s US AI cloud expansion and potential expansion in Washington and Tennessee is dependent on securing multiyear reserve capacity agreements? And if so, one of those commitments would primarily be for bare metal deployments. That is one. And then second, for Jihan and Matt, you know, it would be helpful to hear your perspective on why USA cloud expansion is strategically attractive at this stage. You know, how do you think about sort of long-term competitive advantages in AI cloud as you broaden beyond your current Asia-centric footprint? Thank you.\n\nHaris Basit: So the first part, our expansion of GPU in the United States is dependent on, you know, signing contracts, at least any significant large-scale expansion is. You know, we can speculatively do small expansion in the United States. But as we said in the statement, anything significant would be backed by contracts.\n\nJihan Wu: And we have our own data centers. I think that is very important advantage right now in the US market. Means that under the end of this year, we will be able to deploy the H300 and about rubings with our own data centers. In the United States right now is the center of AI innovation globally. The demand in US market is so much stronger than any other market. And also the US customers also just one. Capacity on US soil. So we have this kind of capacity in US. And we are going to build it, and then we can build it. We will finish it.\n\nI think this will be the most important advantage on the market right now.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

      "Content": "Revenue surged 225.8% YoY to $224.8 million in Q4 2025, but gross profit fell to $10.6 million (4.7% margin) as a ~13% lower average Bitcoin price, higher electricity costs and a shift to a three‑year depreciation schedule materially pressured profitability.\n\nBitdeer is rapidly scaling self‑mining and hardware: self‑mining revenue hit $168.6 million, the company exited 2025 with >55 EH/s and topped >63 EH/s in January, began mass production of SEALMINER A3 and plans SEAL04‑1 volume production in Q1 2026 (SEAL‑DL1 Litecoin chip taped out).\n\nThe firm is pivoting toward AI/HPC colocation and GPU-as-a-Service with 1.66 GW online and a 3 GW pipeline (key sites Tydal, Clarington, Rockdale), while reporting heavy cash use (net operating cash outflow $599.5 million), ~$1.0 billion of borrowings and a switch to GAAP reporting in Q1 2026.\n\nInterested in Bitdeer Technologies Group? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\n4 Blockchain Stocks That Aren’t Coinbase\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported fourth-quarter 2025 revenue of $224.8 million, up 225.8% year over year and 32.5% sequentially, as the company highlighted continued scale-up in self-mining and growing focus on AI and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure opportunities. Management described the quarter as a period of “execution and strategic progress” as Bitdeer positions itself as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Bitdeer posted gross profit of $10.6 million, representing a gross margin of 4.7%, down from 24.1% in the third quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.2 million, compared with $39.6 million in the prior quarter and negative $4.3 million in Q4 2024.\n\n→ Once Upon A Farm: Buy the $1B Growth Story?\n\nBeyond the Halving: The Future of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nChief Strategy Officer Haris Basit said the sequential decline in profitability primarily reflected a 13% lower average Bitcoin price versus Q3 2025, a roughly 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit driven mainly by winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites, and “substantially higher depreciation expense” tied to rapid expansion of self-mining capacity. The company also increased headcount to support mining operations and AI/HPC initiatives and incurred higher year-end compensation and corporate activity costs.\n\nBitdeer also changed its depreciation methodology to a more conservative approach, moving to a three-year straight-line method for mining rigs compared with a prior five-year useful life assumption, which contributed to higher depreciation expense.\n\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nSelf-mining revenue was $168.6 million, up from $41.5 million in Q4 2024 and $130.9 million in Q3 2025. Management attributed the quarter-over-quarter increase to a higher average operating hash rate and Bitcoin production, partially offset by lower Bitcoin prices and a gradual rise in global network hash rate.\n\nBitdeer also reported $23.4 million in SEALMINER sales revenue, up 105.4% from $11.4 million in Q3 2025.\n\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\n\nOn fleet expansion, Basit said Bitdeer exited 2025 with more than 55 exahash per second (EH/s) of self-mining hash rate and added another 8 EH/s in January, exiting the month at more than 63 EH/s. As of January 31, 2026, overall fleet efficiency stood at 17.5 joules per terahash, with SEALMINER A2 and A3 rigs operating at approximately 15–16.5 J/TH and 12.5–14 J/TH, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bitdeer commenced mass production of the SEALMINER A3 series, with initial shipments beginning in November and 8.7 EH/s deployed to date. Basit said mass production of rigs based on the SEAL04-1 chip is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026, while SEAL04-2 remains under development at the company’s U.S.-based design center. Bitdeer also announced it taped out a Litecoin chip (SEAL-DL1) designed for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, with initial test results said to exceed comparable rigs in energy efficiency and hash rate. CEO Jihan Wu noted the company expects “99% or 98%” of operations to remain Bitcoin-focused, while adding that small-scale altcoin mining could improve yields on certain capacity.\n\nIn Q&A, management said there is a Bitcoin price level that could prompt the company to slow mining activity, but it “hasn’t reached it yet,” adding that higher-efficiency portions of the fleet could operate through further price declines while older machines would be turned off first.\n\nBitdeer emphasized progress on its global power and infrastructure footprint. Basit said the company had more than 1.66 gigawatts (GW) of capacity online at the end of January and a total global power pipeline of 3 GW. Management said it is prioritizing colocation services at AI-suitable sites in Norway and the U.S., reflecting increased demand for large-scale colocation capacity.\n\nKey site updates included:\n\nTydal, Norway: A 225-megawatt facility built to Tier 3 data center specifications. Basit said retrofit capex should be lower than typical greenfield Tier 3 development benchmarks of $8 million to $12 million per MW. The site uses hydropower and includes independent 100 MW transformers for redundancy. Management said it is in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expects to be able to announce a signed lease “as soon as possible in 2026,” though timing is difficult to predict. In Q&A, Basit said estimated PUE is around 1.1, citing hydropower, cold climate, and chilled water availability from a nearby lake. He added the company expects completion of the Tydal site by the end of the year, with production GPU installation at the beginning of next year.\n\nClarington (U.S.): A 570-megawatt site where the local utility has accelerated the interconnection timeline, and the company is in discussions with “well recognizable companies” as prospective tenants. Management disclosed litigation has been filed that could delay development, but said it believes it has a strong defense and is exploring alternatives to mitigate impact.\n\nRockdale (Texas): Bitdeer said it is evaluating acquisition of adjacent land to develop greenfield HPC capacity while maintaining its existing 563 MW Bitcoin mining operation. Management said it believes expected additional capacity of up to 179 MW should not be affected by recent ERCOT discussions, though regulations remain under discussion.\n\nWu characterized the company’s approach as using colocation for very large sites while pursuing GPU-as-a-Service for smaller sites such as Washington State and Tennessee/Knoxville, where Bitdeer believes it can manage deployments directly.\n\nBitdeer said it continues to see opportunities for GPU-as-a-Service in targeted markets and is expanding its cloud platform in Malaysia by 10–15 MW, building on activity in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming. In the U.S., the company plans to add 10 MW of GPU capacity in Washington State and is evaluating a partial conversion of its Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud.\n\nManagement stressed that significant U.S. GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customer contracts and that it does not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. In response to an analyst question, Basit reiterated that major U.S. AI cloud expansion is dependent on signing contracts.\n\nOn Malaysia, management said the infrastructure is being leased. Wu added the timeline to deploy GPUs depends on infrastructure readiness, noting it was expected around June but that delays are common; he suggested Q3 or Q4 as a more conservative estimate.\n\nBitdeer reported net cash used for operating activities of $599.5 million, which management said was primarily driven by SEALMINER supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs, corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97.9 million, including $50.7 million of capital expenditures and $150.6 million in proceeds from cryptocurrency disposals. Net cash generated from financing activities was $454.5 million, driven mainly by $388.5 million of proceeds from convertible senior notes, $168 million in related-party borrowings, and $141.5 million of proceeds from shares sold under its ATM and ELOC program, partially offset by $171.1 million in repayments.\n\nOn the balance sheet, Bitdeer ended the year with $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $83.1 million in cryptocurrencies held at cost less impairment, $135.6 million in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1.0 billion in borrowings, excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities tied to convertible senior notes were $501.1 million, which management said reflected non-cash fair value adjustments and did not impact liquidity or operations.\n\nFor capital spending, Bitdeer said full-year 2025 infrastructure capex totaled $176 million. For 2026, it anticipates $180 million to $200 million of infrastructure spend for crypto mining data center construction, excluding capex for SEALMINERS, GPUs, AI cloud, and colocation.\n\nBasit also noted the company will begin using GAAP instead of IFRS starting in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:BTDR) is a global digital asset mining and computing services provider focused on delivering secure and efficient hashrate solutions to institutional and retail customers. The company leverages its proprietary mining platform to offer hosted mining, hashrate sales and management services, enabling clients to access large-scale mining operations without direct investment in hardware or infrastructure.\n\nBitdeer’s core offerings include mining hosting services, whereby the firm installs, operates and maintains specialized mining equipment on behalf of customers, and hashrate-as-a-service products that provide fixed-capacity mining power with transparent pricing structures.\n\nThe article \" Bitdeer Technologies Group Q4 Earnings Call Highlights \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "The pace of artificial intelligence infrastructure investment is showing no signs of slowing, and investors are increasingly looking to companies outside the chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and into the companies enabling next-generation networking. One such company, which is seeing renewed interest, is Lumentum Holdings (LITE), as GF Securities highlighted it as one of the key beneficiaries of Nvidia’s co-packaged optics push.\n\nNvidia used this year’s GTC 2025 conference to launch its Quantum-X and Spectrum-X scale-out switch, which will likely be the precursor to further adoption of optical interconnection technology. This, in turn, should see the next-generation 115.2T CPO switch arrive in 2026, with supply chain acceleration through 2027, which should be a boon to optical component companies such as Lumentum.\n\nStrategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin as Crypto, MSTR Stock Prices Plunge. How Should You Play It Here?\n\nDown 18% From Its Recent High, Should You Buy the Dip in Sandisk Stock?\n\nPfizer Reports Strong Earnings Outlook - Unusual Call Options Activity Shows Investors are Bullish\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nLumentum Holdings is an optical and photonic products company based in San Jose, California, that provides products to the cloud, networking, and industrial sectors. The company, which has a market capitalization of around $40.1 billion and an enterprise value of $42.1 billion, has clearly established itself as a “mission critical” supplier to the buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe stock has seen an explosive move over the last year, trading at $556, with a 52-week range of $45.65-$599.50. The stock has seen an increase of over 600% in weighted alpha, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX). Relative strength is sitting at 74.39, which highlights the stock’s strong performance.\n\nThe stock’s valuation has clearly expanded with the move, and investors seem willing to pay the premium to own this stock as it relates to next-generation artificial intelligence networking infrastructure growth. The stock has seen over 94% of institutional ownership, with a short float of 15.8%.\n\nThe company does not pay a dividend, as it is choosing to reinvest the money into further capacity expansion and next-generation product development.\n\nLumentum’s fiscal second quarter 2026 results were a significant turning point for the company. Revenue was $665.5 million, up considerably from $402.2 million in the year-ago period. Moreover, Lumentum’s GAAP diluted EPS was $0.89, whereas its non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.67, compared with $0.42 in the year-ago period. Lumentum’s margins also improved considerably. GAAP gross margin was 36.1%, while its non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up considerably from the year-ago period.\n\nWhat is more surprising is the fact that Lumentum’s non-GAAP operating margin was 25.2%, an increase of more than 1,700 points from the year-ago period. It appears the company is entering a new era of high volume and high value related to AI optical demand. Lumentum has identified two significant opportunities in the market, which are optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\n\nLumentum’s backlog for OCS is more than $400 million, whereas the company has announced a multi-hundred-million-dollar CPO order, which is due for the first half of calendar year 2027. Moreover, GF Securities has announced that Nvidia’s supply chain is expected to start ramping up in the second quarter of 2026, with acceleration in the second half of 2026 and into 2027.\n\nAnalysts hold positive expectations towards the stock with a “Strong Buy” rating consensus for LITE; however, the current price targets don't quite factor in the stock’s recent run-up. The stock’s current mean target price is $525.11, which it has already surpassed, and it has a high price target of $600 and a low price target of $420.\n\nConsidering the stock’s recent price of around $556, the stock’s mean price target of $525.11 translates into a potential downside of around 5.6%. However, the stock’s street-high price target of $600 implies a potential upside of around 7.9% if AI networking demand continues to surprise on the upside.",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marvell-technology-inc-mrvl-trending-140005205.html",
      "Content": "Marvell Technology (MRVL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Marvell belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMarvell is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +80.9%. This estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.51 indicates a change of +23.6% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.18 billion and $10.04 billion estimates indicate +41.9% and +22.7% changes, respectively.\n\nMarvell reported revenues of $2.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Marvell surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMarvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Monolithic Power (MPWR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MPWR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Monolithic Power's main business drivers.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems, based in Kirkland, WA, designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions. The company focuses on the market for high-performance analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs).\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s products are widely used in industrial applications, telecommunications infrastructure, cloud computing, and automotive and consumer applications.\n\nBeing a fabless company, Monolithic works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the designing and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost.\n\nUnlike other fabless semiconductor companies, Monolithic installs its own proprietary process technologies in third-party contractors&rsquo; equipment and facilities.\n\nMonolithic reported total revenues of $751.15 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company&rsquo;s key product families are direct current to direct current (DC to DC) products and Lighting Control products.\n\nDC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and monitors, automobiles and medical equipment.\n\nLighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products.\n\nBy end market, 21.5% of total revenues came from Storage and Computing in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nEnterprise Data, Consumer, Industrial, Automotive and Communications end-markets contributed 31%, 8.8%, 7.2%, 20.1% and 11.14%, respectively, to the fourth quarter of 2025 revenues.\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s primary competitors are Skyworks Solutions, Microchip Technology, Lattice Semiconductor, IPG Photonics, Power Integrations, Cree, Semtech, Micron Technology, Analog Devices, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES.\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Monolithic Power, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in February 2016 would be worth $21,271.42, or a 2,027.14% gain, as of February 12, 2026, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 279.51% and the price of gold increased 292.77% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MPWR.\n\nMonolithic reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It has a strong growth opportunity due to its robust product portfolio that targets In-Car connectivity and infotainment, advanced driver assistance system and rapid adoption of LED lightings in cars and vehicles. Being a fabless company, MPWR works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the design and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost. However, MPWR faces challenges due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards and short product life-cycles are other challenges.\n\nThe stock is up 21.67% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2026. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.",

The figure decreased 24.2% year over year.\n\nRevenues of $3.94 billion increased 7.5% year over year. However, the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.82%. In domestic currency, revenues increased to RMB27.55 billion, up 3% year over year.\n\nNetEase delivered mixed but resilient segment performance in the quarter, led by a 3.4% year-over-year increase in Games and related value-added services revenues to RMB22.0 billion ($3.1 billion). The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net revenues from self-developed games, such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online, and newly launched games, Where Winds Meet and Marvel Rivals.\n\nYoudao revenues grew 16.8% year over year to RMB1.6 billion ($223.7 million). The year-over-year increase was driven by higher net revenues from its online marketing services and learning services.\n\nNetEase, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NetEase, Inc. Quote\n\nNetEase Cloud Music recorded a steady 4.7% year-over-year rise to RMB2.0 billion ($281.5 million).\n\nThese gains were partially offset by a 10.4% year-over-year decline in Innovative businesses and others’ revenues to RMB2.0 billion ($292.8 million). The year-over-year decrease reflected an increase in certain inter-segment transaction eliminations.\n\nGross profit increased 8.7% year over year to RMB17.7 billion ($2.5 billion).\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 10.9% year over year to RMB9.4 billion ($1.3 billion).\n\nNet income attributable to the company’s shareholders totaled RMB6.2 billion ($892.6 million), while non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders reached RMB7.1 billion ($1.0 billion).\n\nThe effective tax rate increased year over year to 16.4% from 13.4%.\n\nNetEase’s fourth-quarter operational performance highlighted the growing impact of its long-term investment strategy, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence across its game ecosystem.

Titles such as Fantasy Westward Journey, Identity V, Eggy Party, Sword of Justice and Where Winds Meet maintained healthy player communities through consistent content updates.\n\nGlobal portfolio expansion remained another key theme. Sword of Justice recorded a solid reception following its international release, while Where Winds Meet surpassed 80 million cumulative players across platforms, indicating broad global traction. Marvel Rivals further strengthened its worldwide presence through high engagement and industry recognition.\n\nMeanwhile, Blizzard-operated titles in China continued to generate sustained engagement through localized content and enriched experiences, achieving record annual revenues and reinforcing NetEase’s strategic positioning in the domestic market.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2025, net cash — including cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits and restricted cash, as well as short-term investments balance, minus short-term and long-term loans — increased to RMB163.5 billion (US$23.4 billion), up from RMB153.2 billion (US$21.5 billion) as of Sept. 30, 2025, reflecting continued balance sheet strength.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities increased to RMB14.8 billion ($2.1 billion) from RMB12.9 billion ($1.8 billion) in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe board of directors declared a fourth-quarter 2025 dividend of $0.232 per share ($1.16 per ADS), to be paid to its shareholders on record as of March 16, 2026.\n\nCurrently, NetEase carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nIPG Photonics IPGP, MKS Inc.

      "Content": "Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.73 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.14. This compares to a loss of $3.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -430.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.28, delivering a surprise of -481.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nBITDEER TEC GRP, which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $224.84 million for the quarter ended December 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $69.02 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nBITDEER TEC GRP shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.4%.\n\nWhile BITDEER TEC GRP has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for BITDEER TEC GRP was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.16 on $203.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.15 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Cricut, Inc. (CRCT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2025. The results are expected to be released on March 3.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nCricut, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $198.69 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The figure increased 68.3% year over year to $443.7 million. System revenues contributed 33.3% to total revenues. The figure increased 60.1% year over year to $221.8 million.\n\nLITE Q3 2026 Guidance Ignites Estimates\n\nFor Q3 fiscal 2026 (ends March), LITE expects non-GAAP revenues between $780 and $830 million vs a prior consensus closer to $700 million. The company expects non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 30% to 31%, vs expectations of 22%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings between $2.15 and $2.35 per share, vs a prior consensus under $1.60.\n\nAnd if any investor or analyst was wondering if this blistering pace was going to slow down any time soon, management said this during the conference call...\n\n&ldquo;Our forward guidance calls for over 85% year-over-year revenue growth, yet we are only at the starting line for two substantial opportunities: optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\"\n\nAnd analysts are already reflecting this optimism in Q4 FY'26 (ends June) with projected growth of 87.5% to $900 million.\n\nThe full-year 2026 sales consensus moved to $2.9 billion, representing over 76% annual growth. And FY'27 is already projected to come in near $4.7 billion, for a 61.5% advance.\n\nAs you would expect, these sales ramps, combined with improving margins, are driving the bottom line estimates higher for both this year and next.\n\nA month ago, the FY26 EPS consensus was at $5.67 and FY27 at $8.29. Today they stand at $7.63 and $14.11, representing growth of 270% and 85%, respectively.\n\nHow NVIDIA Ignited Demand for Optical Interconnect\n\nI'll admit: I was late to the optical party. And I should not have been since I follow NVIDIA so closely. Lessons learned. In December, I profiled Lumentum optical peer Coherent ( COHR ). Here's what I wrote...\n\nWe know NVIDIA is a big customer of Credo Technology ( CRDO ) AECs because CEO Jensen Huang is a big fan of copper for connecting GPUs within rack-scale architectures and Credo has repeatedly showcased its AECs in live demonstrations at the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference (GTC). These demos feature Credo's AECs connecting servers and switches directly to NVIDIA H100 GPUs to create disaggregated, rack-scale GPU clusters.\n\nBut at GTC in March [2025], Jensen announced a collaboration with a purely optical player, Coherent.\n\nOne big driver of investor enthusiasm that helped drive COHR shares from below $70 to over $190 this year was their collaboration with NVIDIA announced at GTC in March.\n\nCoherent and NVIDIA will develop silicon photonics networking switches using co-packaged optics (CPO). This ecosystem will allow AI factories to connect millions of GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA still uses copper wiring within Blackwell NVL72 rack-scale systems to connect GPUs to each other, but to \"scale out\" across the datacenter Jensen Huang recognized the power and speed of optical solutions to connect many racks together for the lowest latency.\n\nThus NVIDIA has several connectivity and networking systems that use optical and photonics solutions and they can be categorized into two main areas: Interconnect Products, including Infiniband and Ethernet protocols, and the upcoming Co-Packaged Optics, like Spectrum-X Photonics Switches.\n\nLITE and TSMC: Co-Design for the Win\n\nLumentum and Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ), aka TSMC, aka THE advanced chip foundry, are two of the most critical \"ingredient\" partners in NVIDIA's move toward Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).\n\nTheir collaboration solves a massive physics problem: as AI clusters grow to millions of GPUs, traditional copper wiring and pluggable transceivers consume too much power and generate too much heat.\n\nBy moving optics into the chip package, they reduce power consumption by roughly 3.5x and increase signal integrity significantly. Here is how they work together to build this for NVIDIA's next-gen platforms like Quantum-X and Spectrum-X.\n\nBut TSMC has to provide the \"packaging\" that allows electricity and light to live on the same chip. A major challenge with CPO is that lasers are heat-sensitive. If you put a laser directly next to a hot GPU or Switch ASIC, it will fail.\n\nTSMC&rsquo;s Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) is a 3D packaging process. It allows NVIDIA to stack the Electrical IC (the brain) directly on top of the Photonic IC (the eyes).\n\nMe and the Analysts: Won't Get Fooled Again\n\nAfter I understood this integrated circuit of interdependency, I finally bought Lumentum shares in January at $350 on the pullback from $400. Most analysts were still too timid with estimates and the high price targets were only calling for $450. Heck, Morgan Stanley thought $350 was fair!\n\nAfter earnings, LITE could only manage to kiss $500 and retreat. So I sold some of my position at $485, thinking it may have gone too far, too fast.\n\nIn retrospect, I was foolish to ever doubt the risk appetite for Lumentum (LITE) based solely on the weak reception for its stellar report that day.\n\nAnd it should have been obvious as soon as the next day when everything was falling out of bed on Feb 5 because LITE tested the silly post-earnings low at $426 and reversed higher with a big fat engulfing candle to close above $500!\n\nThen Friday, as the upgrades and delayed reactions poured in, she gaps up to $540 and closes above $550.\n\nThey almost got me again with two kisses of $600 on Monday and Wednesday this week, and then another about-face. But I'm not falling for it this time.\n\nI'm holding my shares for the full realization of what NVIDIA (NVDA) is building for the next five years, where optical components are required at multiple stages and optical providers like LITE and Coherent (COHR) can be involved at different stages of design and fabrication with CPO.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the Street herd gathering around $550 with their PTs...\n\nRosenblatt $580\nJP Morgan $565\nCiti $560\nNeedam $550\nSusquehanna $550\nB. Riley $526\nMizuho $525\nBofA $520\nStifel $480\nBarclays $475 (Equal-Weight)\nUBS $455 (from $215! and stays at Neutral)\n\nSee ya next quarter when Lumentum surprises again and they raise their PTs to $650.\n\nDisclosure: I own NVDA, TSM, CRDO, and LITE shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nKevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks where he runs the TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】智原（3035）2026年迎拐點，總經理王國雍直指將是「結構性成長」起點；儘管首季營運相對谷底、營收估季減約1成，但AI專案、先進封裝量產啟動，及晶圓代工夥伴策略發酵下，全年營收可望呈低雙位數成長，且毛利率維持40％以上。智原並以「IP＋ASIC」雙軸布局，卡位先進製程與高階封裝供應鏈，在AI資源排擠與產能瓶頸的新常態中搶得新案。\n智原2025年的營運表現不俗，NRE（委託設計）合併營收達22.9億元，創歷史新高、亦連五年成長；量產營收141.8億元、年增96％，同步刷新歷史紀錄，每股稅後純益（EPS）2.81元。王國雍分析，整體業務結構已經出現質變，先進製程與高階封裝成為主要的成長動能。\n他進一步指出，2025年智原取得5個Design Win，最先進製程為三星4奈米；先進封裝亦拿下10個Design Win，且多數專案今年量產，貢獻大量營收。預估第一季為今年營運谷底，但短期波動不改長線成長，需求將呈「季季成長」，尤以第四季貢獻最顯著。\n智原將AI視為核心驅動力，預估今年AI相關營收占比將上看3成。AI應用拆解為雲端、邊緣與端點三層，王國雍表示，智原並非只押注CSP（雲端服務供應商）通用型模型，也聚焦於專用型AI、及邊緣AI等差異化市場；如公司在邊緣AI已完成多項整合NPU（神經網路處理器）的設計，滿足客戶在本地推論之需求。\n值得關注的是，智原將「IP先行、ASIC接棒」作為今年的另一主軸。王國雍透露，多家晶圓代工夥伴合作持續深化，包括Intel 18A／18AP專案將持續推進，並由Intel協助引薦客戶；與聯電合作的12奈米布局，IP貢獻可望率先顯現，公司看好今年IP營收將有機會挑戰歷史新高，從基礎IP延伸至功能性IP，強化設計的黏著度。\nASIC方面，智原目前掌握逾10個FinFET相關專案在設計中，預期今年下半年起逐步轉為量產收入，成為營收與獲利的接續動能。\n智原以多代工夥伴與封裝整合能力擴大客戶廣度，2026年有望迎新一輪成長循環。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一張珈睿／台北報導)",

Does it involve manufacturing transceivers or broader services? A : Russell Ellwanger, CEO, explained that the collaboration involves aligning output parameters of photonics and other components with Nvidia's needs. The partnership focuses on supply commitments rather than direct manufacturing of transceivers for Nvidia.\n\nQ : Does the 5x capacity increase for silicon photonics and silicon germanium include demand from Nvidia and partners? A : Yes, the capacity increase is in response to total demand, including Nvidia and partners. The plan is to have five times the silicon wafer capacity by the fourth quarter of 2026 compared to Q4 2025.\n\nQ : Are you shipping directly to Nvidia, or through resellers? A : Tower Semiconductor ships silicon-based photonics ICs through module makers or integrators, not directly to Nvidia.\n\nQ : What is the timeline for the additional CapEx rollout, and could it be completed sooner than expected? A : The capacity qualification ramp is expected to be fully online by the third quarter of 2026, with growth occurring in the first and second quarters. While the target is December, some tools may be operational earlier.\n\nQ : How does Tower Semiconductor view the impact of memory shortages on its mobile business? A : Russell Ellwanger acknowledged concerns about market factors like memory shortages but emphasized close collaboration with customers to manage inventory levels and maintain production plans.\n\nQ : Is the 2028 financial model target a run rate or a full-year achievement? A : The target is to achieve the model within 2028, aiming for both a run rate and potentially a full-year achievement.\n\nQ : Does the CapEx investment bring Tower Semiconductor's fabs to full utilization? A : The CapEx investment aims for 85% utilization, assuming prescribed capacity usage across various flows. Silicon photonics alone would not achieve full utilization.\n\nQ : What was the one-time tax benefit amount in Q4 2025? A : Oren Shirazi, CFO, stated the tax benefit was approximately $10 million, resulting from a lower effective tax rate than expected.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .",

      "Content": "智原（3035）2026年迎拐點，總經理王國雍直指將是「結構性成長」起點；儘管首季營運相對谷底、營收估季減約1成，但AI專案、先進封裝量產啟動，及晶圓代工夥伴策略發酵下，全年營收可望呈低雙位數成長，且毛利率維持40％以上。智原並以「IP＋ASIC」雙軸布局，卡位先進製程與高階封裝供應鏈，在AI資源排擠與產能瓶頸的新常態中搶得新案。\n智原2025年的營運表現不俗，NRE（委託設計）合併營收達22.9億元，創歷史新高、亦連五年成長；量產營收141.8億元、年增96％，同步刷新歷史紀錄，每股稅後純益（EPS）2.81元。王國雍分析，整體業務結構已經出現質變，先進製程與高階封裝成為主要的成長動能。\n他進一步指出，2025年智原取得5個Design Win，最先進製程為三星4奈米；先進封裝亦拿下10個Design Win，且多數專案今年量產，貢獻大量營收。預估第一季為今年營運谷底，但短期波動不改長線成長，需求將呈「季季成長」，尤以第四季貢獻最顯著。\n智原將AI視為核心驅動力，預估今年AI相關營收占比將上看3成。AI應用拆解為雲端、邊緣與端點三層，王國雍表示，智原並非只押注CSP（雲端服務供應商）通用型模型，也聚焦於專用型AI、及邊緣AI等差異化市場；如公司在邊緣AI已完成多項整合NPU（神經網路處理器）的設計，滿足客戶在本地推論之需求。\n值得關注的是，智原將「IP先行、ASIC接棒」作為今年的另一主軸。王國雍透露，多家晶圓代工夥伴合作持續深化，包括Intel 18A／18AP專案將持續推進，並由Intel協助引薦客戶；與聯電合作的12奈米布局，IP貢獻可望率先顯現，公司看好今年IP營收將有機會挑戰歷史新高，從基礎IP延伸至功能性IP，強化設計的黏著度。\nASIC方面，智原目前掌握逾10個FinFET相關專案在設計中，預期今年下半年起逐步轉為量產收入，成為營收與獲利的接續動能。\n智原以多代工夥伴與封裝整合能力擴大客戶廣度，2026年有望迎新一輪成長循環。",

It maintained a Neutral rating. Mizuho predicted that global handset shipments will drop 4% year over year in 2026, with additional declines anticipated in the second half.

The firm attributed a global memory chip shortage to impacting smartphone users. After-hours trading saw a 9% decline in shares, which have now dropped more than 13% this year as of February 5, 2026. According to CEO Cristiano Amon, memory limits were the only reason for the projection failure.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kla-shares-drop-15-post-165700060.html",
      "Content": "KLA Corporation KLAC shares dropped 15.1% post second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Jan. 29. The plunge can be attributed to the company’s not-so-impressive guidance, as well as operational headwinds. KLA now expects third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $3.35 billion (+/- $150 million), reflecting a modestly weak product mix on a sequential basis. The guidance also reflects the rapidly escalating cost of DRAM chips used in KLA’s image processing computers that ship with its systems, thereby hurting gross margin. Increasing lead times of its products due to supply constraints and negative tariff impact, roughly 100 bps, are headwinds in the near term.\n\nSo, what should investors do with KLA shares? Let’s find out?\n\nKLA shares have jumped 90.6% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 23.1% and the Zacks Electronics-Miscellaneous Products industry’s appreciation of 37.4%. KLA is benefiting from its dominant process control market share, strong AI infrastructure investment and momentum in advanced packaging.\n\nThe company has outperformed peers, including Applied Materials AMAT, ASML Holding ASML and Axcelis Technologies ACLS, in the past year. Shares of Applied Materials, ASML Holding and Axcelis have returned 81.9%, 87% and 48.1%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKLA is benefiting from strong demand for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging, which is driving top-line growth. Advanced packaging revenues are expected to grow mid-to-high teens on a year-over-year basis in 2026. Strong investments in WFE and advanced packaging represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. Growth of advanced packaging supporting heterogeneous chip integration has become a new market for KLA, which is currently worth $11 billion and growing faster than core WFE.\n\nKLA’s robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. Process control accelerates time to results by resolving process integration challenges during the fab ramp-up phase to optimize time to market for a diverse mix of semiconductor designs.\n\nMoreover, the growing investment in custom silicon, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of unique device designs. This has put customers under pressure to deliver performance, volume and time to market, resulting in strong demand for advanced process control. This aids KLA’s prospects as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology and yield optimization solutions. This bodes well for KLAC’s top-line growth.\n\nKLAC expects the core WFE market to grow in the high single to low double digits in 2026, reaching the low $120 billion range, up from approximately $110 billion in 2025. The company expects the advanced packaging component of the market to grow at a similar rate to roughly $12 billion for a total market forecast in the mid-$130 billion range, an increase in the low double digits versus its forecast for 2025.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $36.58 per share, up 3% over the past 30 days and indicating 9.9% growth from 2025’s reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $13.39 billion, suggesting 10.1% growth from the 2025’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Corporation price-consensus-chart | KLA Corporation Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $9.12 per share, up 2.4% over the past 30 days and indicating 8.4% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $3.37 billion, suggesting 9.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nKLAC shares are trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), KLAC is trading at 33.83X, higher than the broader sector and peers. The broader sector is trading at 26.08X while Applied Materials and Axcelis trade at 32.21X and 20.17X, respectively. However, ASML is pricey with a P/E multiple of 41.48.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnically, KLA is currently trading above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKLA benefits from strong demand for advanced packaging despite increasing lead times and conservative guidance. Robust AI demand bodes well for KLAC’s prospects and justifies a premium valuation.\n\nKLA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which suggests that investors should start accumulating the stock right now as the dip offers a massive opportunity.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsem-tower-revises-model-higher-161800468.html",
      "Content": "By Lisa Thompson\n\nNASDAQ:TSEM\n\nREAD THE FULL TSEM RESEARCH REPORT\n\nAs demand exceeds capacity, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) has decided to accelerate its investment as it sees margins continue to expand from the sale of new products. It is adding another $270 in capex to the next two years of spending to expand capacity for RF infrastructure products as demand outstrips supply. While the company is limited as to how high it can raise prices, it is deemphasizing lower margin products as it ramps new high margin ones. High margin SiPh contributed $228 million in 2025, up from $106 million in revenues in 2024, and with this additional investment, the company plans to grow capacity to greater than 5x of the actual Q4 monthly silicon photonics wafer shipments, compared to the 3x target given during the Q3 call. Over 70% of the total SiPho capacity is either presently reserved or in the process of being reserved through 2028, backed with customer prepayment.\n\nFor Q1 2026, Tower guided to revenues of $412 million plus or minus 5%, which results in slightly accelerating year-over-year growth.\n\nAs of last night’s closing price, the company trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.3 EV to estimated sales for 2027. Since its low at $28.54 on April 4, 2025, the stock has rocketed 379%. TSEM trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.5 EV to estimated sales for 2027, higher than its peers, who trade at an average of 5.7x. However, if we look at the components of that average, we see they diverge, with SMIC and Taiwan Semiconductor averaging 8.4x, while slower-growing Global Foundries and United Microelectronics are at or under 3.0x. At 8.4xs, TSEM stock would be worth approximately $175 per share using 2027 revenues. To be conservative, we are raising our price target to $150 as TSEM works to reach those revenue numbers.\n\nQ4 2025 Results\n\nThe biggest revenue contribution in the quarter again came from RF infrastructure, surpassing RF Mobile. In Q4, RF Infrastructure grew 102% to $141 million, up from $107 million in Q3 2025, and showed growth of 81.3% for the year. SiPh was $95 million of that (including some NREs) for the quarter and grew 70%. For the year, SiPh contributed $228 million compared to $106 million the year before. The growth rates are accelerating as well as the percent contribution to total sales. As they become a bigger portion of total revenues, growth should continue to accelerate.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mrvl-declines-8-3-months-154800725.html",
      "Content": "Marvell Technology MRVL shares have lost 8.2% in the past three months, underperforming its Computer and Technology sector, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry and peers like Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Micron Technology MU.\n\nShares of Broadcom and NVIDIA have lost 4.2% and 2.7%, respectively, while Micron Technology shares have surged 52.4%. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry appreciated 2.7% in the same time frame compared with no change for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven this decline in a month, the question arises: Should investors buy, sell or hold the stock at present? Let’s dive deeper into the fundamentals and financials of the MRVL stock to answer this question.\n\nMarvell Technology’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 signals softer near-term growth. The company guided revenues of $2.2 billion (+/- 5%), representing just 21% year-over-year growth, a slowdown compared to recent quarters. The top line has been in a declining trend for the past three quarters.\n\nDespite strong demand for electro-optics, management expects data center revenues to grow 20% year over year in the fourth quarter, suggesting a decelerating growth rate in the past six quarters. One of the major reasons for this decelerating growth is the growing presence of players like Broadcom and Astera Labs in the AI connectivity space.\n\nBroadcom is strong in networking, data center, broadband, Wi-Fi, Ethernet PHYs and switches. In the communications segment, Broadcom mainly provides high-speed connectivity, optical or wireline networking equipment, cable or broadband IC portfolio, PCIe switch and retimer.\n\nMarvell Technology’s rapid expansion of its portfolio has helped it keep pace with the market trend. MRVL is developing a co-packaged copper system with a 2.5m direct attach cable and a Co-packaged optics switch system. The volume shipments of MRVL’s next-generation 200G per lane 1.6T PAM DSPs are also a tailwind.\n\nThe company recently launched the Golden Cable initiative to accelerate and expand the Active Electrical Cable ecosystem for faster deployment of AI infrastructure by cloud and hyperscaler customers. MRVL is also gaining from the adoption of scale-up switches that connect AI accelerators within and across racks, requiring multi-terabit bandwidth and ultra-low latency.\n\nThe rapid growth of AI workload and allied infrastructure has attracted multiple players in this space. Semiconductor giants, including Micron Technology and NVIDIA, are in the AI processing, networking and memory space. Besides semiconductor partners, MRVL has collaborated with Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nMicron Technology has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth. MRVL has collaborated with MU on HBM design and integration for AI compute platforms to provide a custom HBM compute architecture.\n\nThe growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures. Marvell Technology has partnered with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion technology into MRVL’s custom cloud-platform silicon solution.\n\nTogether with its deep expertise in the AI semiconductor space and strong partner base, the company is able to keep its operating costs low and grow its top line at the same time, hence benefiting from a high growth rate in the bottom line. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, non-GAAP operating expenses grew just 4% year over year, even as revenues climbed 37% year over year, showcasing disciplined cost management.\n\nThe consensus estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 81%. The estimate has remained unchanged for the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMRVL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/S) ratio of 6.87, well below the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry average of 8.4, indicating that the stock appears undervalued at current levels.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough MRVL’s top line is showing a declining growth rate, the company has been able to retain its earnings growth through prudent cost measures. Marvell Technology has strong long-term fundamentals supported by its strong foothold in the data center, deep AI portfolio and high-speed networking space. Considering these factors, we suggest investors retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock at present.

      "Content": "Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Gold.com GOLD as the Bull of the Day and Qualcomm QCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc.&rsquo;s MU .\n\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\n\nA recent pullback in Gold.com stock may be short-lived as gold prices have rebounded to new record highs of over $5,000 per ounce, as shown below, following a sharp pullback to around $4,400 per ounce earlier in the month.\n\nAmid an unprecedented commodity price boom for various precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s stock has been one of the market&rsquo;s top performers in 2026 so far, soaring nearly +90% through the first two months of the year and recently hitting a 52-week high of $66 a share.\n\nOffering a fully integrated alternative assets platform, sentiment continues to build for Gold.com&rsquo;s outlook after reporting impressive results for its fiscal second quarter last Thursday and attracting positive attention from analysts in the process.\n\nHeadquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and formerly known as A-Mark Precious Metals, Gold.com provides an array of precious metals, including minted gold bars, silver, platinum, and palladium, along with copper bullion and numismatic coins to wholesale and retail consumers.\n\nStrong Q2 Results & Strategic Expansion\n\nEnforcing the narrative that Gold.com is executing well, Q2 sales spiked 136% year over year to a quarterly record of $6.47 billion from $2.74 billion in the comparative quarter. Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\n\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\n\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\n\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\n\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\n\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\n\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\n\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nQualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\n\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\n\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\n\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\n\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\n\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\n\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\n\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\n\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\n\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\n\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nMicron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\n\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\n\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\n\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\n\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\n\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\n\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\n\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\n\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\n\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Investors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\n\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\n\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\n\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.",

      "Content": "Silicon Motion (SIMO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this chip company have returned +15.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Silicon Motion belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +90%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +25.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52.7%. This estimate has changed +21.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.93 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $299.65 million indicates a year-over-year change of +80%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.24 billion and $1.41 billion estimates indicate +39.5% and +14.2% changes, respectively.\n\nSilicon Motion reported revenues of $278.46 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +45.7%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $0.91 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $261.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.61%. The EPS surprise was -2.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Silicon Motion surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSilicon Motion is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Skyworks SWKS and RF Industries RFIL.\n\nIndustry: Electronics - Radio Frequency\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2847030/2-radio-frequency-stocks-to-watch-from-a-prospering-industry\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry participants like Skyworks and RF Industries are benefiting from the continued adoption of WiFi 7, as well as the rapid proliferation of the edge IoT, AI data centers and automotive electrification. The growing need for faster connections, low latency, and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots.\n\nThe democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry participants. Nevertheless, industry players are facing a challenging demand environment that has resulted in inventory buildup. Sluggish capital spending by telecom carriers has been a headwind. Industry participants are suffering from heightened global macroeconomic uncertainties. Weakness in end-markets like automotive, industrial and infrastructure has been concerning.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in the congested RF spectrum.\n\nThey serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n3 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF Industry\n\nAccelerated 5G Deployment Acts as a Tailwind : The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications look promising for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which is expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. The growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects.\n\nInnovation Opens up Business Avenues : The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects.

The evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects. The rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers. Industry participants are looking to address these challenges with a robust range of antenna-plexer portfolios utilizing the BAW technology.\n\nGrowing Adoption of Electric Vehicles Aids Prospects : Industry players are gaining from the increasing inclusion of their products in electric vehicles (EVs). The market for EVs is expected to expand fourfold by 2027.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #20, which places it in the top 8% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry&rsquo;s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&rsquo;s earnings estimates for 2026 have moved up by 7.4% since June 30, 2025.\n\nGiven the bright prospect, there are a few stocks worth watching in the industry. However, before we present the top industry picks, it is worth looking at the industry&rsquo;s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Lags S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry has underperformed the S&P 500 and its broader sector over the past year. The industry has declined 9.6% over this period against the S&P 500&rsquo;s return of 16.8% and the broader sector&rsquo;s appreciation of 21.8%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing the Semiconductors - Radio Frequency stocks, the industry is currently trading at 12.51X, lower than the S&P 500&rsquo;s 22.98X and the sector&rsquo;s 25.91X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.71X and as low as 7.89X, the median being 14.65X.\n\n2 Radio Frequency Stocks to Watch\n\nRF Industries : Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have moved up 111.8% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRF Industries benefits from growing adoption of its integrated solutions, with backlog increasing to $15.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. The company is gaining its footprint among wireless, aerospace, public safety and industrial OEM customers. RFIL&rsquo;s prospects ride on diversifying portfolio, customers and end markets, as well as an expanding partner base.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RFIL&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 earnings has increased 8 cents to 43 cents per share over the past 30 days.\n\nSkyworks : This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from positive momentum in demand signals and backlog improvement, especially in automotive electrification, edge IoT, and AI data centers. The growing adoption of Wi-Fi 7 and upcoming Wi-Fi 8 systems drives growth. Strong demand for RF content in real-time video, sensors and software-defined vehicles provides a boost to SWKS&rsquo; prospects.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenues between $875 million and $925 million. SWKS expects a roughly 20% decline in Mobile, while Broad markets are expected to remain flat sequentially but grow high single digits year over year.\n\nSkyworks shares have dropped 4.8% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SWKS&rsquo; fiscal 2026 earnings has increased 6.8% to $4.70 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "MoneyDJ新聞 2026-02-11 10:38:26 數位內容中心 發佈\n華邦電（2344）近期在記憶體需求回溫下，營運動能明顯改善，公司管理層在法說會揭露的營運數據顯示，受AI與資料中心帶動，DRAM與SLC NAND等產品線出現供不應求情況，帶動合約價明顯上揚。公司並指出，短期內DDR4供應缺口仍大，報價已較去年底大幅提升，預期今年各季合約價將呈逐季上漲趨勢。\n財務面方面，華邦電公布2025年全年合併營收894.06億元，年增9.6%，第四季單季營收266.25億元，季增逾二成且年增逾四成。公司2025年稅後淨利31.77億元，較前一年大幅轉盈，每股盈餘0.88元；第四季稅後純益34.22億元，單季EPS 0.76元。董事會決議發放下半年現金股利每股0.5元。\n毛利率與資本支出成為營運關鍵。華邦電表示，第四季毛利率雖較前季回落，但全年毛利率已由去年水準提升至35%，管理層並預估本季毛利率可望超過46.9%。為擴充產能以因應需求，公司計畫將2026年資本支出大幅提升至約421億元，其中九成以上用於晶圓廠生產設備。\n產能規劃方面，華邦電透露目前已將2026與2027年的產能訂單多數售罄，尤其以成熟製程的DDR4與2D NAND為主，公司也加速台中與高雄廠的設備投資以提升產出。管理層同時表示，為維持議價彈性與價格優勢，公司傾向以短期契約逐季談價，對於長期多季鎖價合約持保留態度。\n產品與市場布局上，華邦電強調在NOR Flash市占優勢與掌握SLC NAND應用市場的地位，同時推動能效與客製化整合解決方案以切入新興應用。公司指出，包括CUBE等記憶體架構在內的產品線，正逐步導入具體客戶需求，期望提升高附加價值產品比重。\n風險管理與營運提醒方面，華邦電指出，短期內價格波動性與供應鏈變動仍是營運須持續關注的要素；公司將以逐季談判與產能調配作為主要策略，並持續依據市況調整資本支出與生產排程，以維持供應穩定與毛利水準。",

      "Content": "【財訊快報／陳孟朔】儘管英特爾(Intel，美股代碼INTC)在先進製程代工領域頻傳捷報，但週二(10日)股價仍慘遭血洗，收盤大跌3.11美元或6.19%，報47.13美元，淪為費城半導體指數表現最差的成分股。市場人士指出，雖然英特爾成功吸引聯發科(2454)與蘋果(Apple)評估其最新技術，但投資人更擔憂其產能轉換期的財測疲軟與供應短缺問題。在代工業務方面，最新消息指出聯發科有機會成為英特爾14A製程的首批重量級客戶，計畫利用該1.4奈米級工藝量產新一代「天璣(Dimensity)」行動晶片。此外，蘋果亦傳出已簽署保密協議，積極評估英特爾18A-P製程與先進封裝技術。分析師預測，若測試順利，蘋果最快將在2027年將入門級M系列晶片、2028年將非Pro版iPhone晶片部分轉交英特爾代工，這將打破台積電(2330)近十年來獨家供應蘋果先進晶片的局面。\n然而，亮眼的客戶名單未能挽救疲軟的短期股價。英特爾近期公布的2026第一季財測遠低於華爾街預期，財務長Zinsner表示，由於正全力從舊製程轉向18A等先進節點，加上緩衝庫存已耗盡，第一季將面臨嚴重的供應瓶頸。這種「有需求卻無貨可賣」的困境，加深了市場對英特爾能否如期量產並維持良率的疑慮，導致股價在費半指數中墊底。",

      "Content": "Entegris beat or hit guidance in Q4 with sales of $824 million (down 3% y/y, up 2% sequentially), a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.7% , and non‑GAAP EPS of $0.70 , while full‑year unit‑driven revenue rose about 2% and CapEx‑driven revenue fell ~ 7% .\n\nFree cash flow improved to $404 million (a 12.7% FCF margin) in 2025, CapEx was $299 million and is expected to decline to ~ $250 million in 2026, while net debt ended Q4 around $3.4 billion with net leverage at 3.8x and a target to get below 3.5x by end‑2026.\n\nManagement sees a more constructive 2026 backed by mid‑single‑digit industry MSI growth, > 20% NAND bit growth and node transitions (including 2nm) that should raise content per wafer, alongside POR wins at advanced nodes and a push to increase local‑for‑local Asia supply for China.\n\nInterested in Entegris, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nIndustrial Tech Crossovers: When Manufacturing Meets Innovation\n\nEntegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) reported fourth-quarter 2025 results that came in at the high end or above its guidance ranges, as management emphasized disciplined execution and early signs of a more constructive semiconductor backdrop heading into 2026.\n\nChief Executive Officer Dave Reeder said fourth-quarter revenue, gross margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, and non-GAAP EPS all landed at the high end or above guidance. For the full year, he said total revenue was approximately flat versus 2024 excluding divestitures, with “unit-driven” revenue up about 2% in 2025 and “CapEx-driven” revenue down 7% in line with reduced industry fab construction spending.\n\n→ 3 ETFs Designed to Survive the Next Market Crash\n\n5 Trends You Need to Know This Quarter\n\nChief Financial Officer Linda LaGorga said fourth-quarter sales were $824 million , down 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. GAAP gross margin was 43.8% , and non-GAAP gross margin was 44% , with the sequential improvement driven primarily by increased production volumes.\n\nLaGorga reported GAAP operating expenses of $256 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $188 million . Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7% of revenue, above guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.70 , which she said was above guidance.\n\n→ 3 Consumer Staples Stocks Breaking Out This Month\n\nChip Gear Maker Entegris Has Potential, But Is It Buyable Now?\n\nBy segment, LaGorga outlined:\n\nMaterial Solutions (MS): Q4 sales of $362 million , flat year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Sequential growth was driven primarily by advanced deposition materials, supported by demand for molybdenum (moly) deposition within NAND. Adjusted operating margin was 20.9% .\n\nAdvanced Purity Solutions (APS): Q4 sales of $465 million , down 5% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by fluid handling and FOUPs, partially offset by liquid filtration, which delivered “another record quarter.” Adjusted operating margin was 24.8% .\n\nFor 2025, LaGorga said free cash flow was $404 million , representing a 12.7% free cash flow margin, nearly a 300 basis point improvement year over year. She attributed the improvement to working capital execution, including accounts receivable and reduced year-over-year inventory growth.\n\n→ 2 Subscription Economy Winners That Still Dominate Their Niches\n\nCapital expenditures in 2025 were $299 million , about 9% of sales. Reeder added that Entegris has completed a multi-year manufacturing CapEx investment cycle that began in 2022 and expects 2026 CapEx to decline to $250 million , with longer-term CapEx returning to approximately 7% to 8% of sales.\n\nOn the balance sheet, LaGorga said Entegris paid down $150 million of term loan debt in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year. Gross debt ended the quarter at about $3.7 billion , with net debt of $3.4 billion . Net leverage ended 2025 at 3.8x , and management reiterated a target to reduce net leverage to below 3.5x by the end of 2026.\n\nReeder said the industry backdrop “appears more constructive” in 2026 and highlighted multiple areas that could support improvement versus 2025, including logic and memory node transitions, stronger industry MSI (wafer starts) growth, and a recovery in fab construction spending.\n\nManagement expects mid-single-digit industry MSI growth in 2026 and noted that about 75% of Entegris revenue is unit-driven and correlated to MSI. Reeder said advanced logic utilization is already near 100%, and he expects demand for 2-nanometer devices to meaningfully increase wafer output through 2026, benefiting Entegris through higher content per wafer and the company’s share positions at advanced nodes.\n\nIn memory, Reeder described NAND transitions from “low 250 layers” to about 300 layers and said next-generation DRAM and HBM products are expected to roll out in 2026. He said NAND bit growth is expected to exceed 20% in 2026, driven more by higher layer count than a major increase in MSI, and he expects a double-digit increase in NAND content per wafer tied to higher layer nodes and new materials such as moly and selective etch.\n\nFor CapEx-driven exposure, management said 25% of company revenue is tied to industry CapEx, with roughly two-thirds of that correlated to fab construction and one-third to wafer fab equipment (WFE). Reeder said fab construction spending is expected to grow modestly in 2026 after a high single-digit decline in 2025, while WFE is expected to deliver strong growth. He cautioned during Q&A that the timing of fab construction-related demand has been moving “pretty significantly month to month,” and he characterized the fab CapEx portion as a “wild card,” potentially more second-half weighted.\n\nReeder updated investors on four CEO priorities he first discussed last quarter:\n\nDeepening customer intimacy and securing positions of record (PORs): He said Entegris has secured strong POR positions at the most advanced logic nodes across product lines including CMP consumables, advanced deposition and implant materials, liquid purification/filtration, and wafer handling. He also cited traction in advanced memory (DRAM/HBM) and POR wins in next-generation NAND across deposition materials, CMP, and selective etch applications.\n\nImproving utilization and rationalizing the footprint: Reeder said the Taiwan facility continues to ramp, and the Colorado facility is expected to substantially complete key customer product qualifications in 2026. He also said Entegris exited its Chester, Pennsylvania facility in the fourth quarter and expects to rationalize at least one additional facility in the first half of 2026.\n\nImproving free cash flow: Reeder said free cash flow margin improved to 12.7% in 2025, in line with the company’s target, and that free cash flow is now incorporated into short- and long-term incentive plans.\n\nIncreasing local-for-local manufacturing (especially for China): Reeder said the company expects about 85% of China revenue in the first quarter to be supplied by Asia facilities, with the proportion increasing through 2026.\n\nOn China, management said China remained about 21% of sales in both 2024 and 2025, with dollars down slightly. Reeder said the company’s main obstacle in China is assuring supply, and he expects continued progress in qualifying more Asia-based manufacturing to support that market.\n\nReeder also said Entegris is rescheduling its Capital Markets Day from May to the fall due to the CFO transition, and he thanked LaGorga for her contributions.\n\nFor the first quarter, LaGorga guided sales of $785 million to $825 million , reflecting about a 4% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Gross margin is expected to be 44.5% to 45.5% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including about 100 basis points of benefit in Q1 from a change related to the useful lives of assets.\n\nShe guided EBITDA margin of 26.5% to 27.5% , GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.51 , and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.78 . For Q2, management expects sales to increase 1% to 3% sequentially from Q1, in line with normal seasonality.\n\nIn Q&A, management said gross margin has stabilized around the current range, with volume leverage, the Taiwan ramp, and facility rationalizations expected to support improvement as production increases.\n\nEntegris, Inc is a leading provider of advanced materials and process control solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. The company develops and supplies a broad portfolio of products designed to ensure purity and reliability throughout the manufacturing process, helping customers address critical contamination and yield challenges.\n\nEntegris's product offerings include high-purity chemicals and specialty materials, liquid and gas filtration and purification systems, and sophisticated wafer and chip handling solutions.\n\nThe article \" Entegris Q4 Earnings Call Highlights \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

A : David Reeder, CEO, explained that the industry backdrop for 2026 appears more constructive than in 2025. Entegris expects to benefit from node transitions in both logic and memory, which typically drive additional content per wafer. While CapEx was not favorable in 2025, it is expected to be more constructive in 2026, particularly in fab CapEx. The company is cautiously optimistic about achieving outperformance, contingent on the timing of node transitions and CapEx developments.\n\nQ : How should we think about the margin trajectory for 2026, given the guidance for Q1? A : Linda Lagorga, CFO, noted that gross margin has stabilized and is expected to improve with increased production volumes. The ramping of the Taiwan facility and rationalization of existing facilities are expected to contribute to margin improvement. The company is focused on volume leverage to drive margins, which will positively impact EBITDA.\n\nQ : What is the outlook for MSI (wafer starts) and CapEx for 2026? A : David Reeder, CEO, stated that MSI is expected to grow in the mid-single digits for 2026. CapEx is anticipated to be up modestly, with strong growth in WFE (wafer fab equipment) and a potential increase in fab construction CapEx in the second half of the year. The company is monitoring these factors closely as they impact revenue growth.\n\nQ : Can you provide an update on the competitive landscape in China and how Entegris is addressing it? A : David Reeder, CEO, emphasized that the fundamentals in China are similar to the rest of the world, focusing on yield and performance. Entegris is working to assure supply to Chinese customers by qualifying more manufacturing overseas, particularly in Asia. The company expects to supply approximately 85% of China revenue from regional facilities in Q1, with plans to increase this proportion through 2026.\n\nQ : How is Entegris positioned to benefit from the growth in AI and advanced packaging markets? A : David Reeder, CEO, highlighted that about 60% of Entegris' revenue comes from advanced nodes, with AI being a significant growth driver. The company is focusing on advanced packaging, which grew nicely in 2025 and is expected to continue growing in 2026. Entegris is making concerted efforts to expand its product lines in this area, anticipating more benefits in 2027 and beyond.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .",

      "Content": "Applied Materials AMAT shares have risen 7.6% in a month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s decline of 1.6% and 0.1%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe rise in the stock price has made AMAT a premium, as it trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.67, which is above the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s P/S ratio of 8.46.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven AMAT’s stock price rise in the past month and its overvaluation at present, investors might question: Should they buy, hold or sell the stock? Let’s discuss the fundamentals in detail.\n\nAMAT specializes in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Recent launches like Xtera epi, Kinex hybrid bonding, and PROVision 10 eBeam will add to AMAT’s growth story.\n\nAMAT expects next-generation technologies to be produced in large volume, which means that the company’s customers will be ramping up their foundries, naturally benefiting AMAT’s business. In 2025, AMAT strengthened its leadership in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50%. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\n\nAMAT expects its leading-edge foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory and high bandwidth memory to be the fastest-growing wafer fabrication equipment businesses in 2026. AMAT’s advanced packaging business, which is currently valued at $1.5 billion, is still on track to double to $3 billion over the next few years, driven by HBM demand and next-generation packaging architectures.\n\nThese factors will contribute to increased traction in Applied Materials’ wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), driven by growing usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing. AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT restructured its pricing program, and it is expected to contribute most of the 120-bps gross margin expansion in the coming fiscal year. This cost restructuring will further provide AMAT with enough headroom to ramp up its R&D investments. AMAT is setting up the Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization center for research, which is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nApplied Materials is winning over its competition like KLA Corporation KLAC, Lam Research LRCX and ASML Holding ASML in the semiconductor supply chain market.\n\nLam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although they develop solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holdings develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions like Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\n\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\n\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in GAA transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nWith these factors in place, AMAT’s long-term growth outlook remains strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 revenues are expected to rise 13.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 earnings is expected to grow 22% year over year. AMAT's fiscal 2027 earnings estimates have been revised upward in the past 30 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging, driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing, is a tailwind for AMAT stock. Considering these long-term growth factors, we suggest investors book this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock at present.

      "Content": "Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) shares rose after the company -- which sells critical design architecture for making semiconductors -- saw artificial intelligence (AI) demand boost its revenue. The stock, however, has still lost about a third of its value over the past year and it faces a big potential risk next fiscal year. Let's see what that is -- and what investors should do.\n\nAfter an initial dip following its results, Arm shares rallied as investors turned their focus more toward its AI opportunities than worries about smartphones. Arm said it sees its data center business becoming its largest segment in the coming year, and that it will reach a 50% market share among top hyperscalers. This growth is being led by the shift toward inference and AI agents, which it says makes central processing units (CPUs) more important within the data center.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nHowever, the company did admit that increasing memory supply constraints could put a dent in smartphone sales, with talk of a potential 15% reduction in volumes over the next year. That said, it noted that even a 20% reduction would only equate to a 2% to 4% effect on its smartphone royalties. However, this company is trading at a growth multiple, so that is a big potential risk.\n\nOverall, Arm's fiscal third-quarter revenue jumped 26% year over year to $1.24 billion. License revenue rose by 25% year over year to $505 million. Its agreement with Softbank contributed $200 million to that total. It increased its number of Arm Total Access licenses in the quarter by two, to 50. Over half of its top 30 customers use this license. It also added six Arm Flexible Access customers, bringing the total to 318.\n\nRoyalty revenue, meanwhile, rose 27% year over year to $737 million. The growth was driven by increased adoption of newer ARM technology, including Armv9 architecture and Arm CSS (compute subsystems), which carry higher royalty rates. It said five customers are now shipping devices with CSS chips, including the top four Android phone makers.\n\nAnnualized contract value (ACV), which smooths out license revenue, soared 28% to $1.62 billion. Looking ahead, Arm guided for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to come in around $1.47 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%. Royalty growth is projected to be up by the low teens and licensing by the high teens. It forecasts that adjusted earnings per share will be between $0.54 and 0.62.\n\nArm's licensing and royalty business model is attractive given its high gross margin and recurring nature, and the company has an opportunity to continue to grow nicely in the data center space. Meanwhile, its ties to Softbank provide a steady stream of growth.\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 49 based on analysts' fiscal 2027 consensus, and a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.7 (with below 1 considered undervalued), ARM looks reasonably priced. However, the likely weakness in the smartphone market next year isn't necessarily embedded in those estimates, and as such, this would keep me on the sidelines for now.",

      "Content": "（中央社記者曾筠庭台北2026年2月10日電）經濟部智慧財產局今天公布，去年台灣專利百大名單中，台積電 (2330) 、友達 (2409) 、鴻海 (2317) 、南亞科 (2408) 、瑞昱 (2379) 、台達電 (2308) 、聯發科 (2454) 、緯創 (3231) 、華碩 (2357) 、中光電 (5371) 、慧榮及工研院等12家企業與科研機構，不僅在國內AI專利布局領先，也同時入榜科睿唯安今年「全球百大創新機構」，凸顯台灣企業在研發創新與全球專利布局上的實力，持續獲得國際肯定。\n智慧局今天舉行年終記者會，局長廖承威表示，AI技術已廣泛應用於半導體、製造、資通訊與終端應用等領域，台灣申請人展現高度國際視野與策略性布局，許多機構選擇以台灣做為專利申請首站，利用國內約8至9個月即可取得初步審查意見的效率優勢，作為後續進軍美國、日本等主要市場的重要參考依據。\n在企業表現方面，廖承威指出，台積電連續10年蟬聯本國人發明專利申請件數冠軍，儘管台積電部分核心技術採營業秘密方式保護，但其累積國內外獲准專利數已突破7萬8000件，在美國的專利核准率更是接近百分之百，顯示技術領先幅度明顯。\n智慧局表示，鴻海集團近年積極運用專利分享機制，自2023年起提供各事業單位資源，除考量技術的「實際使用地」與「製造地」，也提前布局具潛力的海外市場，深化全球專利布局，並同步在台灣與海外提出申請，促進關鍵技術在本土扎根。\n智慧局指出，IC設計大廠聯發科則持續投入AI人工智慧、6G、WiFi 8、智慧裝置、多媒體影像處理等系統單晶片設計的研發，並將成果轉化為全球專利布局，維持國際競爭力。\n科研機構方面，智慧局表示，工研院第10度蟬聯全球百大創新機構，秉持著「量足質精」原則推動專利布局，除協助國家發展前瞻技術外，也透過分級管理與市場評估機制，確保專利具備實際商業應用價值。\n學界在專利商品化表現也持續成長，智慧局表示，成功大學在發明專利申請量上達成「4連冠」，透過產學合作機制，將學術研究成果轉化為產業應用，台灣科技大學則積極推動專利商品化，去年度產學合作簽約金額達新台幣5億3000餘萬元，113年智財收益也創下1億3000餘萬元新高。\n廖承威表示，由於AI相關專利撰寫與審查門檻較高，目前已由審查官編撰「我國AI相關發明案例集」，彙整6則AI相關發明實務案例與審查重點，協助產業提升專利品質與國際競爭力，期盼共同建構更健全的台灣AI創新生態系。",

      "Content": "The S&P 500 is off to a fairly underwhelming start. As of Monday's close, it was up less than 2% since January. Many growth stocks have been struggling, while dividend stocks are suddenly becoming hot buys.\n\nTwo dividend stocks that are off to hot starts since the beginning of the year are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) . They have soared past the broad index, and here's why it might not be too late to invest in them.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nEntering trading on Tuesday, Lockheed Martin's stock was up 32% year to date. It's a fantastic performance after an unexciting year in 2025, when its share price was flat.\n\nThe company posted some strong earnings numbers at the end of January, reporting that its backlog was a record $194 billion. Its numbers came in better than its own expectations, and the business said it experienced \"unprecedented demand\" in the previous year. With strong government relationships and more growth expected for 2026, it's little wonder the defense stock has been a good buy early on.\n\nIts yield of 2.2% is also about twice what you'd get with the average S&P 500 stock right now. And at 21 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst projections), it's not an expensive stock to own, either. For long-term investors, Lockheed Martin can be a great stock to buy and hold.\n\nAnother stock that's been red hot to start 2026 is semiconductor company Texas Instruments. It's up just over 26% and it also recently released its earnings numbers. For the last three months of 2025, its revenue of $4.4 billion rose by 10% year over year, as demand from data centers has been strong and driving a lot of growth for the business.\n\nIts diversified semiconductor business features more than 80,000 parts that help companies in various industries, making it an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33 is a bit high, but with some encouraging long-term growth prospects and its data center segment potentially being a catalyst for the foreseeable future, the stock can still be a suitable option for investors who are looking to buy and hold for years.\n\nTexas Instruments pays an above-average dividend that yields 2.6%, and it has been increasing its payout for 22 consecutive years. This is not only a promising growth investment, but also a terrific dividend stock to hang on to for the long haul.",

      "Content": "智原 (3035-TW) 今 (10) 日召開法說會，總經理王國雍指出，第一季營收約莫季減 10%，不過，隨著公司布局先進製程與先進封裝的效益逐步顯現，公司已拿下 5 奈米的專案，並有高達 9 個先進封裝的案件將在今年陸續量產，預計今年營運將季季高，全年營運樂觀看。\n智原預估，第一季營收季減約 10%，其中 IP 業務呈現季增，但 NRE 與量產 (MP) 營收同步下滑，單季毛利率約落在 45%。展望 2026 年，智原在扣除 2025 年一次性備料因素後，預估全年營收將呈現年增低雙位數 (11-13%) 幅度，其中 IP 業務穩定成長，NRE 顯著放大，量產營收則逐步走升，對中長期營運維持審慎樂觀態度。\n王國雍表示，公司正積極爭取先進製程與先進封裝新案，去年先進製程共取得 5 個 Design win，不僅案件數量增加，製程節點也從 12/14 奈米推進至更先進節點，目前接案最先進製程已達 4 奈米，顯示接案結構出現明顯質變，未來量產後可望帶來可觀營收貢獻。\n在先進封裝方面，智原指出，高階封裝與先進製程 ASIC 密不可分，公司從 SoC Die 設計切入，並以彈性商務模式串聯供應鏈。去年已取得 10 個先進封裝案件，涵蓋 2.5D 與 3D 封裝，今年預計將有 9 項產品陸續進入量產，並依專案進度逐步放量，預期第四季貢獻度最高。\n同時，智原持續提升國際客戶比重，去年國際客戶開案占比已達 6 成，客戶遍及歐美與日本，應用領域多與雲端 AI 相關，包括 Smart NIC 與特殊領域的 AI 加速器等。\n展望 2026 年，智原點出四大關鍵趨勢，將逐步轉化為公司長期成長動能，包括專用型 AI、邊緣與終端 AI、ASIC 資源排擠效應，以及晶圓廠產能排擠效應。智原指出，金融與健康醫療等專用型 AI 應用市場正逐步打開，公司近期已接獲相關案件；AI 運算架構也持續由雲端向邊緣端擴散。另一方面，雲端服務業者 (CSP) 積極自研 ASIC，排擠設計資源，反而突顯智原既有設計能量與整合能力的優勢。\n在產能端，智原觀察到先進製程需求外溢效應，不僅影響 ASIC 開案資源，也延伸至晶圓廠端，相關產能需求轉向與智原合作的晶圓代工夥伴。\n智原進一步指出，2025 年將是業務結構新舊交替期，自今年起營運將出現結構性改變，除了成熟製程逐步復甦，更重要的是先進製程快速擴張。目前先進製程需求已「爆棚」，已有超過 10 個 FinFET 專案進入設計階段，並將於今年開始貢獻營收。\n公司預期，今年第一季為全年營運谷底，隨著 9 顆先進封裝產品於年底前量產，全年營運將呈現季季高走勢。上半年成長動能以 NRE 為主，下半年除 FinFET 量產營收外，先進封裝貢獻也將同步放大，下半年表現可望明顯優於上半年。",
