      "Content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is an extremely volatile asset. This has been a notable trend in recent months. The world's top cryptocurrency is trading 46% below its peak as of this writing. Perhaps it's a good idea to buy the dip.\n\nFirst, though, it's important to gain a better understanding. Here are three things every Bitcoin investor needs to know.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nAny Bitcoin investor must know that there will only ever be 21 million units in circulation. This is a hard supply cap etched in the software via halving events that reduce the number of new Bitcoin units mined by a factor of 2 roughly every four years. It makes this asset extremely predictable, as the inflation rate is predetermined.\n\nThat finite supply contrasts starkly with the current monetary system. Governments continue to run up their debt balances, with rising money supplies. There's no end in sight to this financial mismanagement. This is especially true in the U.S. Bitcoin's fixed-supply structure is superior, as market participants aren't seeing their positions being constantly debased.\n\nBlackRock once put out a graphic with an eye-popping statistic. During the 11-year stretch between the start of 2013 and the end of 2023, Bitcoin outperformed every other asset class. The following year, in 2024, it climbed another 120%. In the past decade, Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed 17,000%. Investors worried about the recent dip should zoom out.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited by this sort of monumental gain. That's what happens when an entirely new financial instrument, once viewed as a worthless internet currency in the early days, evolves into a globally recognized asset attracting interest from individuals, corporations, asset managers, and governments.\n\nLast month, Bitcoin celebrated its 17th birthday. In January 2009, the first block was mined on the blockchain. Despite a nearly two-decade lifespan, the Bitcoin network has never been hacked. Most people might not realize this fact.\n\nThis could be surprising, given the high-profile blow-ups in the crypto industry. In the early 2010s, the Mt. Gox exchange was breached. In 2022, FTX went bankrupt after misusing customer funds. When these failures occur, investors can easily lose confidence in digital assets. However, Bitcoin has stood the test of time. This points to its resilience.\n\nInvestors now know more about this crypto to make an informed portfolio decision.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor , and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 13, 2026.\n\nNeil Patel has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "A few big names dominate tech stock headlines. This is rightfully so, but there are other tech companies worthy of investors' time and money.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is absolutely one. What was once a standard networking and software company is now a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) custom chip builder partnering with the world's top hyperscalers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nWhat separates Broadcom from the pack is its strong financial profile. The company's solid free cash flow, currently standing at $7.4 billion, has enabled it to pay dividends consistently while continuing to invest in growth. Recent earnings reinforce the narrative that Broadcom is a powerhouse .\n\nIn its fourth-quarter 2025 report, Broadcom's revenues grew 28% year over year, and free cash flow was up 36%. Even if growth slows slightly in the coming quarters, Broadcom's robust balance sheet has given it a true economic moat. The company also announced a 10% increase in its dividend in its latest earnings.\n\nBroadcom's stock is somewhat volatile, but historically patient Broadcom investors have been rewarded . As of Feb. 11, the stock has risen 45% over the past 12 months and an astounding 615% over the past five years. Broadcom's market cap has exploded to more than $1 trillion in this time as well, making it one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nWhat's most impressive about Broadcom is its ability to execute and deliver. Broadcom's $162 billion backlog should ensure it has room to run for the next decade.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) stock has experienced a dramatic recovery over the last year. The geopolitical concerns that weighed on the stock earlier in the decade have eased somewhat, and the return of Jack Ma to the company has bolstered investor confidence.\n\nNow, Alibaba will announce its earnings for the December quarter of 2025 on or around Feb. 19, and the business update presents investors with a difficult question. Should they add shares before the report, or could the news from the report endanger the rally?\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nA look at the company's recent earnings history might not be much of a help to prospective investors . Alibaba's earnings fell short of estimates in three of the last four quarters, though the last earnings beat came in last year's December quarter.\n\nMoreover, Alibaba stock rallied by around 45% over the last year. Still, most of that gain occurred between late August and early October of last year, indicating the report from its June-ended quarter sparked the rally.\n\nStill, the strong AI-driven growth that it mentioned might be less meaningful in an environment where investors have questioned the recent increases in AI stocks.\n\nThe latest company financials offer both hope and disappointment. In the first six months of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30), cloud revenue rose by 30% year over year, while its two e-commerce segments increased by 12% and 14%, respectively, over the last year.\n\nUnfortunately, its smaller business experienced a 27% decline in revenue. That meant overall revenue during the period rose by just 3% annually to almost $70 billion.\n\nHowever, Alibaba stock sells at a P/E ratio of 22. That is significantly less than Amazon at 28 times earnings or its Southeast Asian peer, Sea Limited , which trades at a 47 P/E ratio. Still, considering that Alibaba's P/E ratio was 12 last summer, the stock might appear less attractive in today's trading environment.\n\nGiven the business conditions, financials, and the stock performance of Alibaba, investors should probably refrain from adding shares before the earnings report.\n\nIndeed, the stock's outlook has improved significantly from last summer , and the double-digit revenue growth for its e-commerce and cloud segments appears encouraging. Also, its 22 P/E ratio appears inexpensive compared to its peers.\n\nStill, lessened geopolitical concerns do not mean those worries have disappeared entirely. Considering that Amazon sells for 28 times earnings, its less volatile business environment could make it a more attractive choice.\n\nFinally, investors should keep the three earnings misses over the last year in mind. With the company's history of falling short of such estimates, the stock is more likely to fall than rise following its report.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alibaba Group wasn’t one of them.

Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need.

The company's mobile sports betting operations are now live in 26 states and Washington, D.C., making them available to about half of the U.S. population.\n\nDraftKings' average monthly unique paying customers were flat at 4.8 million, while its average revenue per customer increased 43% to $139. A higher mix of parlay bets and sportsbook-friendly sporting event outcomes contributed to the gains.\n\nAll told, the online betting pioneer generated net income of $136 million, compared to a loss of $135 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nMoreover, DraftKings' adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) soared 284% to $343 million.\n\nStill, investors appeared to focus on the company's 2026 guidance. DraftKings expects full-year revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.9 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $700 million to $900 million. Wall Street had expected revenue of $7.3 billion.\n\nThe shortfall likely sparked concerns about intensifying competition, not just from rival sportsbook operators but also fast-growing prediction markets.\n\nCEO Jason Robins, however, sees prediction markets as a \"massive, incremental opportunity\" rather than a threat.\n\n\"We plan to deploy growth capital to build the best customer experience in predictions, and acquire millions of customers,\" Robins said. \"We have the playbook to execute and win.\"\n\nBefore you buy stock in DraftKings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DraftKings wasn’t one of them.

This is well below the rather stretched P/E premiums other high-growth tech stocks can command and offers a distinct discount to the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nMore intriguing, MU trades nicely beneath Sandisk Corporation SNDK and Western Digital’s WDC forward earnings multiples of 23X and 31X, as two of the other prime beneficiaries of the global memory chip shortage.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron has enjoyed exceptional pricing power, an advantage that strongly supports the continued momentum in its stock. Since being added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on August 20, 2025, Micron stock has soared a staggering 865% .\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal.\n\nSources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2026 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates no portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.\n\nAll data is as of January 31, 2026 unless otherwise noted.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260213409387/en/\n\nContacts\n\nLiberty All-Star® Growth Fund, Inc.\n1-800-241-1850\nwww.all-starfunds.com\nlibinfo@alpsinc.com",

      "Content": "With net sales of $66 billion in the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended Nov. 23), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is among the leaders in the global retail sector. And its shares, which have generated a total return of 193% in the past five years (as of Feb. 10), have boosted investor portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $500 in this top retail stock right now?\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nCostco's massive scale affords it cost leadership, as it's able to flex its bargaining power over suppliers when buying merchandise. Supported also by its no-frills shopping environment, this leads to everyday low prices for its 81 million membership households , a figure that has expanded over time.\n\nThat has propelled ongoing revenue and profit growth. And with management continuing to open 25 to 30 new warehouses every year, Costco will be bigger in the future.\n\nWise investors have Costco on their watch lists right now. This is a fantastic business that has stood the test of time.\n\nHowever, it's not the smartest idea to buy the stock at these levels. That's because the current price-to-earnings ratio of 52 indicates a very expensive entry point. This leaves no margin of safety for prospective investors.\n\nIt's best to follow the company. And be patient for the right opportunity to present itself.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor , and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 13, 2026.\n\nNeil Patel has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "STORY: U.S. stocks were little changed on Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 ticking up fractionally, and the Nasdaq making the biggest move with a less than quarter percentage-point drop. All three indexes declined for the week, with tech stocks on a roller-coaster ride due to uncertainty over AI disruption of the sector, as well as massive AI-related spending. Nancy Tengler is CEO and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. “I think you're seeing a market that's tug-of-warring between fear and greed. And that's typical in these periods. Just going back to DeepSeek, you know, Broadcom was down 15% and ended up 102. Google was down 18, ended up 100. In these periods, it's very difficult to step in. And so the Nasdaq is getting punished. But we don't think the technology trade's over. And frankly, without technology, it's going to be very hard for the market to go up in any sustainable fashion.” Shares of Nvidia and Apple, both down more than 2%, were the biggest drags on the S&P 500. Shares of Applied Materials provided the strongest boost, jumping more than 8% after the chipmaking-equipment firm forecast second-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street expectations. And shares of networking equipment provider Arista Networks gained nearly 5% after forecasting annual revenue above expectations. Meanwhile, the latest inflation data showed U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in January. Traders now put the chances of an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in June at more than 50%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.",

      "Content": "When markets are up, we feel like geniuses. But when they turn volatile, investors often ask a different question: “What keeps paying me no matter what?” Having a stable income suddenly feels more valuable and can make the sting of volatility hurt a little less. I’m talking about the kind of income that shows up quarter after quarter, even when headlines turn negative and stock prices swing.\n\nThat is where companies on the Dividend Aristocrats list stands out. These are S&P 500 companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. They have managed not only to pay but also to increase shareholder payouts.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nInvestors in Search of Alpha Are Fleeing Tech Stocks for These 3 High-Yield Sectors Instead\n\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nToday, I’m screening my Dividend Aristocrats list, which are not only consistent dividend payers but also still growing earnings and cash flow, supported by solid analyst coverage.\n\nUsing Barchart’s Stock Screener, I selected the following filters to get my list:\n\nAnnual Dividend Yield % (FWD): Left blank so I can sort it from highest to lowest.\n\nCash Flow Growth Last Year (%): At least 1% increase year-over-year, displaying the company’s ability to reinvest and grow dividend payments.\n\nEPS Growth Vs Prev Yr: Greater than 1%. Companies whose net profit increased over the past year.\n\nNumber of Analysts: 12 or more. A higher number suggests greater confidence in the rating.\n\nAnalyst Rating: Consensus Moderate to Strong Buy\n\nDividend Investing Ideas: Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nWith these filters set, I ran the screen and got 19 results and I'll cover three companies with the highest forward annual dividend yield.\n\nLet’s kick off the list with the first Dividend Aristocrat:\n\nAmcor Plc is a global packaging company that makes flexible and rigid packaging for various industries, including food, healthcare, and consumer products. Its wide product portfolio helps protect products, extend shelf life, and improve sustainability across markets worldwide.\n\nIn its recent quarterly financials, Amcor reported that sales rose 68% YOY to $5.4 billion and net income was up 9% to $177 million. But that’s not the whole story- its operating cash flow grew 5.22% in 2025, and full-year EPS increased 7.5%, which suggests (slow but) steady growth.\n\nAmcor has paid increasing dividends for 27 consecutive years. Today, it pays a forward annual dividend of $2.60, translating to a yield of just over 5%.\n\nMeanwhile, 16 analysts rate the stock a “Moderate Buy”. It has around 20% upside if it achieves its high target of $60.\n\nThe second Dividend Aristocrat is Federal Realty Investment Trust , a REIT that operates retail and mixed-use properties in high-income U.S. markets, primarily through shopping centers and urban retail locations.\n\nIts most recent quarterly financials reported that sales were up 6% YOY to $322 million. Net income also increased 1% to $61 million. Federal Realty’s operating cash flow rose 3.37% over the past year, while its EPS grew 3.51%, which is pretty solid as REITs are not usually built for rapid earnings expansion.\n\nFederal Realty has increased its dividends for 58 consecutive years, and currently pays a forward annual dividend of $4.52, translating to a yield of approximately 4.3%.\n\nFurther, a consensus among 19 analysts rates the stock a “Moderate Buy” and suggests there’s around 15% upside should it reach its target high of $120.\n\nThe final Dividend Aristocrat on my list today is McCormick & Company, a renowned food company known mainly for its wide range of spices used to enhance the taste of home and commercial food meals around the world. Actually, I think there’s a strong chance that at least one of its products is already sitting in my kitchen cabinet.\n\nIn its recent quarterly financials, McCormick reported sales increased 3% YOY to $1.9 billion, and operating cash flow rose 4.37%. On the bottom line, net income grew 5.3% to $227 million.\n\nIn terms of providing shareholder value, McCormick increased its dividends for 40 consecutive years, paying a forward annual dividend of $1.92, translating to a yield of ~2.7%.\n\nWith that, a consensus among 13 analysts rate the stock a “Moderate Buy” with as much as 24% upside potential if the stock hits its high target of $89.\n\nThere you have it, three of the highest-yielding Dividend Aristocrats worth buying today. They didn’t make the noisiest headlines, but they do continue to provide a stable source of income even through volatility. Though, as they say, nothing lasts forever, and past years’ results may not be as good as this year. But remember, it’s how all funds are sold- so it’s never wrong consider the fundamentals first.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Walmart WMT shares have been standout performers this year, handily outperforming not just the broader market indexes and brick-and-mortar retail peers but also Amazon AMZN and many members of the Magnificent 7 group.\n\nWith the company set to report quarterly results on Thursday, February 19th, it will be interesting to see whether the stock can maintain its momentum after the results.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart shares (green line, up +20.2%) relative to the Mag 7 group (blue line, down -5.4%), the S&P 500 index (red line, down -0.4%), Amazon (purple line, down -13.9%) and Target shares (orange line in the chart, up +18.2%). Target has also been added to the chart, though the company will be reporting quarterly results on Tuesday, March 3 rd .\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe should keep in mind, however, that the performance pecking order shifts when we move the starting point of this chart back by 12 months, as shown below. Target has enjoyed an impressive run this year, but the retailer’s one-year performance is comparable to Amazon’s.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart’s share price outperformance reflects the market’s collective optimism about the company’s large and growing digital business, which has enabled it to tap new growth opportunities such as third-party fulfillment and advertising.\n\nWalmart’s e-commerce business complements its core merchandise, which remains heavily indexed toward groceries, other essentials, and must-have necessities. This orientation towards essentials, coupled with Walmart’s well-earned reputation for low prices, provides the company’s results with a high degree of cyclical stability.\n\nWe should note, however, that a big contributing factor to Walmart’s stock market momentum over the last few years reflects its ability to gain market share among higher-income households. Driving those gains has been a combination of higher-income households trading down to Walmart in response to inflation and the ease of using the company’s e-commerce capabilities. Walmart has consistently flagged market-share gains across all income categories, particularly in the high-income category, and we expect further gains on that front in this quarterly report as well.\n\nResults likely benefited from pulled-forward demand in anticipation of tariffs, particularly in some categories like electronics. Growth in e-commerce and steadily lower losses in that business, coupled with gains from third-party fulfillment and advertising, are some of the other areas that will benefit results this quarter.\n\nThe e-commerce business in the U.S. is now profitable and will likely become a significant contributor to earnings in 2026 and beyond. E-commerce accounts for an estimated 15% of total ex-gasoline sales at present, which management sees eventually increasing to more than double that level over time.\n\nWith respect to tariffs, management noted earlier in the year that roughly two-thirds of U.S. sales were from domestically sourced products, which gave them a degree of insulation from the tariffs issue compared to others. A big part of this is Walmart’s groceries business, which accounts for almost 60% of its sales, unlike Target, where groceries are a much smaller part of the revenue mix.\n\nManagement has reiterated its commitment to maintain price advantage over rivals, a function of Walmart’s size, the nature of its supplier relationships, and the increasing automation of its logistical operations. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.73 in EPS on $189.9 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +10.6% and +5.2%, respectively. Estimates have been stable, though they have nudged up a hair since the quarter began.\n\nIn terms of same-store sales, the expectation is of U.S. comps (ex fuel) of +4.17%, which will compare to a +4.4% gain in the preceding quarter (vs. expectations of +4.02%), and a +4.9% gain in the year-earlier period (vs. expectations of +4.36%). A positive general merchandise read will also have positive read-throughs for Target.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2025 Q4 earnings season scorecard , we now have results from 13 of the 31 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 13 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have already reported Q4 results belong mostly to the e-commerce and restaurant industries, though we have several restaurant companies on deck to report this week as well.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for these 13 retailers that have reported are up +6.3% from the same period last year on +11.6% higher revenues, with 46.2% beating EPS estimates and 76.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the EPS beats percentages for these online players and restaurant operators are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. In fact, the Q4 EPS beats percentage at 46.2% matches the lowest beats percentage for this group of Retail sector companies in the preceding 20-quarter period. Unlike EPS beats, revenue beats are far more numerous and tracking above historical averages.\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 13 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q4 earnings were up +5.9% on +13.6% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart now a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s coming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player, thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThrough Friday, February 13 th , we have seen Q4 results from 371 S&P 500 members, or 74.2% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +8.8% higher revenues, with 75.5% beating EPS estimates and 72.5% beating revenue estimates.\n\nWe have more than 400 companies on deck to report results this week, including 56 index members. The week’s lineup includes a blend of operators such as Palo Alto Networks, DoorDash, Etsy, and Booking Holdings, as well as traditional bellwethers such as Toll Brothers, Deere, and others.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the growth rates for these 371 index members with what we had seen from this same group of companies in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages for this group companies relative to what we had seen from them in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison chart below puts the Q4 net margins for the 371 companies that have reported in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimates for the current period (2026 Q1) have risen modestly in recent days, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n2026 Q1 estimates have increased modestly for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the start of January, including Tech, Industrials, Retail, Utilities, and Business Services. On the negative side, Q1 estimates have come down for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Energy, Medical, and Consumer Discretionary sectors.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Analyzing the Evolving Earnings Picture: What Should Investors Know?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "After beginning the year on a strong note, shares of e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have recently fallen off a cliff.\n\nLet's dig into why Amazon investors are running for the hills. Is now a good opportunity to buy the dip in Amazon, or is the stock turning into a falling knife ?\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nOver the last three years, Amazon has accelerated its capital expenditures (capex) significantly. Rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) is causing Amazon to invest heavily across the infrastructure value chain -- from building data centers, designing its own custom silicon, and complementing these chips with GPUs from Nvidia .\n\nAmazon reported earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2025 on Feb. 5. Prior to the report, Wall Street was expecting management to guide for around $150 billion in capex this year. With this in mind, investors had sticker shock when the company's plans for $200 billion capex were revealed.\n\nThe trends in the chart sum up why Wall Street is getting skittish over Amazon. The inverse correlation between rising infrastructure spend and decelerating cash flow generation is a major concern for investors.\n\nWhere investors may be missing the mark is looking at Amazon's revenue growth. Over the last year, sales and operating profits from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division have consistently risen. In other words, Amazon's high-margin cloud business is experiencing both accelerating sales and profit margins.\n\nThis dynamic is allowing the company to allocate capital across so many different AI-related projects. Building its own data centers and custom chips, alongside its strategic investment in Anthropic, is helping Amazon vertically integrate its AI operations.\n\nIn the long run, this should significantly reduce costs and lead to stronger earnings growth. When you think about it this way, Amazon's playbook to double down on its AI infrastructure roadmap looks savvy. While rising capex may be a near-term dent for free cash flow, the long-term gains are hard to deny.\n\nAs of this writing, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is hovering near its lowest level throughout the entire AI revolution.\n\nConsidering sales from AWS are beginning to reaccelerate and are complemented by robust profit margins, I am confident that Amazon's decision to continue investing in AI infrastructure makes sense strategically. While I understand investor concerns around execution risk, I think Amazon has already done a fine job of mitigating these worries.\n\nTo me, the sell-off in Amazon stock is overdone, and the stock looks like a no-brainer right now. Against this backdrop, I'd say Amazon isn't just a good stock to buy -- it's a great one for long-term investors to buy and hold.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nRad AI's award-winning artificial intelligence technology helps transform data chaos into actionable insights, enabling the creation of high-performing content with measurable ROI.

      "Content": "FedEx (FDX) ended the recent trading session at $374.72, demonstrating a +1.42% change from the preceding day's closing price. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.05%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.1%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.22%.\n\nThe package delivery company's stock has climbed by 17.98% in the past month, exceeding the Transportation sector's gain of 8.02% and the S&P 500's loss of 1.99%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of FedEx in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $4.06, signifying a 9.98% drop compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $23.46 billion, up 5.89% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $18.38 per share and revenue of $92.6 billion. These totals would mark changes of +1.04% and +5.32%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for FedEx. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.11% upward. At present, FedEx boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, FedEx is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 20.1. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 20.1, which means FedEx is trading at no noticeable deviation to the group.\n\nIt is also worth noting that FDX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.8. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.87 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry is part of the Transportation sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 86, finds itself in the top 36% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Applied Materials ( AMAT ) reported its Q1 earnings on February 12. The earnings beat consensus estimates for adjusted EPS and revenue, and the stock is trading 10% higher at the time of writing, Friday morning, Feb. 13, according to Yahoo Finance .\n\nThe supplier of semiconductor and semiconductor-related fabrication equipment reported revenue of $7 billion, a 2% year-over-year decline, yet the earnings report got investors excited and prompted Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya to raise his price target for Applied Materials.\n\nThe cause of excitement was CEO Gary Dickerson’s prepared remarks during the earnings call : “For Applied, we expect to grow our semiconductor equipment business more than 20% this calendar year. We see the demand profile weighted towards the second half of the calendar year, with availability of customer cleanroom space being a key factor pacing the rate of investment.”\n\nDickerson continued by making this great outlook sound even better. “Our largest customers are giving us increased longer-term visibility to ensure we have operational capacity and service support in place for their ramps,\" he added.\n\n\"Based on this visibility, we expect strong growth momentum to be carried into 2027.”\n\nTo put it all in perspective, we can look at the complete Q2 guidance versus what analysts expected. The numbers come from the Bank of America research note shared with TheStreet.\n\nMetric\n\nManagement Guidance (Q2 2026)\n\nWall Street Consensus\n\nBank of America\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n$7.65 Billion (±$500M)\n\n$7.03 Billion\n\n$6.85 billion\n\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS\n\n$2.64 (±$0.20)\n\n$2.29\n\n$2.20\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\n\n~49.3%\n\n48.5%\n\n48.4%\n\nThe great outlook makes even more sense when we consider what the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) estimates for 2026.\n\n“The global semiconductor industry posted its highest-ever annual sales in 2025, nearly hitting $800 billion, and global sales in 2026 are projected to reach roughly $1 trillion,” stated SIA CEO John Neuffer.\n\nFollowing the report’s release, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya and his team updated their view on AMAT stock.\n\nRevenue of $7.65 billion\n\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.64\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 49.3%\n\nThe team estimates the company will gain approximately 1% in 2026, thanks to cyclical growth, leadership in DRAM, advanced packaging, and deposition and conductor etch systems.\n\nAnalysts raised their non-GAAP EPS estimates for 2026 and 2027 by 18% and 24% to $11.86 and $14.57, respectively.\n\nApplied Global Services could grow at a rate higher than the typical low-double-digit pace through steady install base expansion, with all recurring revenue helping fund capital returns.\n\nApplied Materials captures more than 50% of the serviceable addressable market share in inflection points such as Gate-All-Around (GAA) and backside power delivery, where revenue opportunities increase by 30% versus FinFET .\n\nSystems' gross margins of 54% improved by 1% year over year and can expand further as Applied Materials prices to value.\n\nRelated: Bank of America resets Amazon stock price target after earnings\n\nArya reiterated his buy rating for AMAT stock and raised the price target to $420 from $350, based on his 29 multiple of his price-to-earnings ratio estimate for calendar year 2027.\n\nHe said the multiple is at the high end of Applied Materials’ historical trading range of 10 to 30. The numbers are justified by the potential for wafer fab equipment outgrowth in 2026 and 2027, Arya added, and they remain at a discount relative to other large peers, given a more balanced growth profile and lower profitability.\n\nSlower-than-expected capital spending cycle\n\nDelay in memory capacity adds\n\nMarket share loss in deposition, implant, thermal, chemical mechanical planarization, etch, or process control segments\n\nDemand destruction in PCs and mobile as a headwind\n\nMerger and integration risk, along with macro headwinds\n\nApplied Materials reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, regarding allegations that certain customer shipments to China between November 2020 and July 2022 did not comply with the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, based on the company’s misunderstanding of the applicability of those regulations.\n\nThe company has agreed to pay $252.5 million to the Department of Commerce. The U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have closed their related investigations without action.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nApplied Materials announced that Samsung Electronics will join the new, $5 billion Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization (EPIC) Center in Silicon Valley. According to Applied Materials, its EPIC Center will open this year as the world’s largest facility for collaborative research and development of semiconductor process technology and manufacturing equipment.\n\nThe co-development programs at the EPIC Center will be designed to speed up the development and deployment of next-generation semiconductor technologies. The joint research and development programs will work on new materials and process technologies for chips, multiple manufacturing processes (nodes) ahead of the current generation.\n\nApplied Materials introduced new deposition, etch, and materials-modification systems that boost the performance of logic chips at 2nm and beyond. The transition to GAA transistors is a pivotal moment for the industry, as it will enable energy-efficient computing needed to deliver more powerful AI chips.\n\n“The rapid progress of AI is pushing compute performance to the limit, and breakthroughs in computing begin with the transistor,” said Dr. Prabu Raja, president of the Semiconductor Products Group at Applied Materials.\n\n“To keep pace in the angstrom era, Applied is delivering materials engineering breakthroughs that improve energy-efficient compute. Together, these new systems extend Applied’s longstanding leadership in driving major transistor and wiring inflections, while helping customers accelerate their chip roadmaps to keep up with the blistering pace of AI.”\n\nRelated: Bank of America resets Qualcomm stock price target after earnings\n\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 13, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

The company is benefiting from the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI)-driven memory and storage markets. The positive impacts of inventory improvement across multiple end markets are driving top-line growth.\n\nThe surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery will aid significant revenue and earnings growth in the coming quarters. Its solid financials, positive free cash flow and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while enhancing shareholder value.\n\nMicron Technology&rsquo;s long-term customer agreements and expanding AI partnerships reduce volatility and enhance revenue visibility. Nonetheless, rising operating costs and a massive increase in capital expenditure pose a downside risk to Micron&rsquo;s near-term profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>> )\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past six months (+22.3% vs. +7.5%). The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. It is refocusing on the core strengths of investment banking (IB) and trading businesses through restructuring and scaling back its consumer banking footprint, which will likely support top line growth in the upcoming period.\n\nHowever, its high dependence on overseas revenues is worrisome. The rising expense base due to ongoing investments in technology and elevated transaction-based costs during periods of higher client activity might hamper near term profitability.\n\nNonetheless, the company's expansion in the private equity credit market is expected to diversify revenues and will support its growth over the long run. Further, a solid liquidity profile will support its capital distribution activities.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Goldman Sachs here >>> )\n\nVerizon&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past six months (+17.7% vs. -1.3%). The company recorded solid fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The buyout of Frontier Communications has accelerated its broadband expansion plans.\n\nVerizon appears to be at a critical inflection point and remains focused on making necessary capital expenditures for steady 5G deployment, the densification of the 4G LTE wireless network to cater to huge traffic demands across multiple verticals and fiber densification.\n\nHowever, the spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage surging data traffic. High spending on promotional activities to attract customers is straining Verizon&rsquo;s profits. Weakness in the wireline business is another concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>> )\n\nShares of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage have underperformed the Zacks Food - Natural Foods Products industry over the past six months (-32.8% vs. -25.9%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $595.64 million is facing risks which include margin pressure from inventory shrink, long-term lease obligations limiting flexibility, macro and supply chain vulnerabilities, and weak digital capabilities. Trading at just 0.43X EV/sales and 6.02X EV/EBITDA, valuations are attractive versus peers.\n\nNevertheless, Natural Grocers posted a 14% YoY rise in Q1 FY26 net income to $11.3M, with EPS up to 49 cents, supported by disciplined cost control and 1.6% revenue growth. EBITDA rose to $22.6M, highlighting operational leverage despite modest top-line gains. Strong liquidity ($23.2M cash, $67.6M credit availability) and a debt-light balance sheet support a 25% dividend hike and active buybacks.\n\nNatural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage is expanding cautiously with 6&ndash;8 new stores planned, enhancing brand reach in underserved markets. Its 900+ private-label SKUs support margin and loyalty, reinforcing differentiation in the competitive organic segment. Operating efficiency improved.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage here >>> )\n\nTeam&rsquo;s shares have underperformed the Zacks Building Products - Maintenance Service industry over the past six months (-34.3% vs. +2.5%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $65.64 million is facing structural leverage, high interest burden, persistent GAAP losses, working capital drag, MS segment margin volatility and contingent legal liabilities. Upside hinges on sustained margin expansion, cash flow conversion and progress toward double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins.\n\nNevertheless, Team benefits from a large, durable opportunity in critical infrastructure services, supported by aging assets, regulatory requirements, and sustained energy, midstream and industrial demand. The third-quarter 2025 results showed solid execution, with 6.7% year-over-year revenue growth, strong momentum in the IHT and MS segments, and meaningful margin expansion,driven by pricing, mix and cost discipline.\n\nCanadian operations are recovering, validating localized commercial strategies, while an integrated service model supports lifecycle-driven growth and operating leverage.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Team here >>> )\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the tech landscape at breakneck speed, and investors are scrambling to lock in the biggest winners. Yet even in a crowded AI trade, few names have delivered like Micron Technology (MU). The memory-chip giant has ridden the AI wave to record highs, with MU stock delivering massive returns over the past year. Surging demand for memory chips from AI hyperscalers racing to build out massive data center capacity has been the primary engine behind Micron’s remarkable ascent.\n\nBut every rally eventually meets a reality check. Micron’s momentum recently hit a speed bump earlier this week after reports suggested that Samsung Electronics is nearing certification from Nvidia (NVDA) for its next-generation HBM4 chips. High-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized chip designed to move enormous volumes of data at ultra-fast speeds, is a critical component inside AI accelerators.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nNvidia relies heavily on HBM for its AI processors, making supplier approvals a closely watched development on Wall Street. Now, with Samsung reportedly preparing to begin mass production of its next-generation HBM chips earlier than expected, competitive dynamics in the AI memory space could shift quickly.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant’s progress threatens to add meaningful pressure on Micron, which is a key supplier of advanced memory products used across data centers and AI infrastructure. Given this latest development, should you buy, sell, or hold MU stock? Let's take a closer look.\n\nBased in Boise, Idaho, Micron Technology stands at the center of the global memory market, supplying the chips that quietly power today’s data-driven world. The company designs and manufactures a broad portfolio of DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory products that sit inside everything from cloud data centers to smartphones and connected devices.\n\nWith a strong emphasis on engineering expertise and manufacturing scale, Micron plays a critical role in enabling AI workloads and other compute-intensive applications. From large-scale data centers to edge devices and mobile platforms, its memory and storage solutions form the backbone of systems that process, store, and move vast amounts of information every day. With a market capitalization of roughly $465 billion, Micron has grown into a semiconductor heavyweight.\n\nShares dipped about 2.8% on Feb. 9 following news surrounding Samsung, but that pullback barely dents what has been an extraordinary run. Over the past year, the stock has skyrocketed an eye-popping 336%, leaving the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) — up just 12% over the same stretch — far in the dust. After touching a record high of $455.50 last month, Micron now sits only about 9% below that peak, underscoring just how powerful its AI-fueled rally has been.\n\nWhile Micron has delivered a breathtaking rally, its valuation remains far from excessive. MU stock trades at roughly 12.6 times forward earnings, a sharp discount to the sector median of 23.6 times. For a company powering the AI memory boom, that gap suggests investors are still paying a relatively modest price for its growth trajectory, even after an extraordinary run.\n\nMicron kicked off fiscal 2026 with a strong quarter. In its Dec. 17 earnings report, the company crushed both top- and bottom-line expectations, posting revenue of $13.6 billion, up 57% year-over-year (YOY) and comfortably ahead of the $12.7 billion consensus estimate. The results marked Micron’s third-straight quarter of record revenue, powered by a 69% surge in DRAM sales and a 22% increase in NAND revenue.\n\nDRAM alone generated $10.8 billion, accounting for 79% of total sales, while NAND contributed $2.7 billion, or 20%. Notably, total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, HBM and data center revenue, and revenue across each business unit all reached new records. Cloud memory sales climbed to $5.28 billion, doubling YOY, while core data center revenue rose 4% annually to $2.38 billion.\n\nThe company said performance across both major segments was driven by higher pricing. Profitability also followed a similar growth trajectory. Adjusted gross margin came in at 56.8%, up from 39.5% in the year-ago quarter. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS soared a stunning 167% YOY to $4.78, crushing the Street’s $3.78 estimate.\n\nLooking ahead, Micron struck an optimistic tone for Q2 fiscal 2026, projecting revenue of around $18.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.42. Management expects strong AI-driven demand across data centers and edge computing to continue, even as supply constraints are likely to persist through 2026, a backdrop that could further reinforce pricing strength.\n\nDespite intensifying competition, Wall Street’s conviction in Micron remains firmly intact. MU stock carries a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, with 33 out of 42 analysts calling it a “Strong Buy,” six assigning a “Moderate Buy” rating, and just three recommending a “Hold.”\n\nEven after its powerful run, optimism hasn’t faded. While MU has already surged beyond its average price target of $345.97, the Street-high target of $500 implies that there could still be roughly 21% upside ahead. That's a sign that many analysts believe the AI-driven momentum is far from over.\n\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Title": "NVIDIA vs. SMCI: Which AI Hardware Stock Is the Better Buy Now?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-vs-smci-ai-hardware-200000479.html",
      "Content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI are both currently riding the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom. But with Supermicro facing margin pressure and NVIDIA offering far stronger profitability metrics, could NVDA now be the better investment? Let’s take a closer look –\n\nThe rise in data center capital spending has led to stiff competition between NVIDIA and its peers, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC. However, despite the challenges, NVIDIA managed to post solid quarterly results consistently, banking on the rapid progress in AI. Quarter after quarter, NVIDIA’s performances were commendable due to the increasing demand for its chips, including the latest Blackwell architecture and cloud-based graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNVIDIA’s revenues jumped 62% year over year and 22% sequentially to $57 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2026, according to investor.nvidia.com. In fact, the company expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to come in at nearly $65 billion, with a plus or minus 2%. And why not? Thawing trade tensions between the United States and China are expected to support NVIDIA’s sales. The U.S. government has approved the shipment of NVIDIA’s H200 AI chips to China, while Chinese authorities have permitted their sale to selected customers.\n\nAI is significantly increasing demand for hardware, which is likely benefiting Supermicro. The company’s Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) has seen growing adoption among AI clients, offering a comprehensive package that includes integrated servers, networking, storage, cooling, software and related services. This momentum has translated into robust revenue growth, with its fiscal second-quarter 2026 sales climbing 123% year over year to $12.7 billion, easily exceeding analysts’ expectations of $10.4 billion, according to ir.supermicro.com.\n\nCEO of Supermicro, Charles Liang, added that Supermicro is scaling its AI server and storage capabilities and that its DCBBS helps customers deploy AI infrastructure faster and cost-efficiently, positioning the company to gain from the next wave of AI demand. Management remains bullish about Supermicro’s sales outlook, expecting fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues to reach $12.3 billion, and full-year net sales to hit $40 billion or more.\n\nDespite Supermicro’s rapid rise in revenue growth, ongoing pressure on its gross margins for some time has remained a concern. So, Supermicro earns less profit per dollar of sales. This is largely because, acting as an intermediary between NVIDIA and cost-conscious customers, its products have offered limited differentiation in a highly challenging, commoditized market.\n\nNonetheless, Supermicro’s gross margins dropped to 6.3% in fiscal second-quarter 2026 from 11.8% in the same quarter last year and 9.3% in the fiscal first quarter of 2026. Such low margins indicate that the company may face difficulties in generating profits once operating expenses are considered. In contrast, NVIDIA continues to demonstrate strong profitability, with its gross margin increasing to 73.4% in fiscal third-quarter 2026 from 72.4% in the fiscal second quarter of 2026, alongside steady revenue growth.\n\nNVIDIA, anyhow, consistently delivered stronger profits than Supermicro, reflected in its return on equity (ROE) of 99.2% compared with SMCI’s 17.8%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSupermicro, meanwhile, has a debt-to-equity ratio of 66.9%, higher than NVIDIA’s 6.3%, suggesting greater financial risk and increased exposure to economic headwinds.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTherefore, NVIDIA clearly stands out as the better stock to buy at this time, thanks to robust demand for its advanced chips and improving trade relations. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Supermicro has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Wall Street may argue all about the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, but big tech's spending plans in global AI infrastructure are too large to ignore, right now. Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms expect to collectively spend roughly $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up about 60% year over year.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWith a significant portion of this spending already locked in through data center permits, power contracts, and supply agreements, core AI infrastructure players such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are likely to benefit from the near-term demand.\n\nHere's why stocks of these two companies can go parabolic in the coming years.\n\nNvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, refers to AI as the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history.\" The company estimates global AI infrastructure spending to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of 2030. With a full-stack AI platform that includes hardware, software, and enterprise platforms and an annual product cadence (releasing new upgrades and architectures each year), the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nIn 2026, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting Nvidia's Blackwell B200 systems, which the company claims deliver up to 30x higher inference (real-time model deployment) performance and better power efficiency than the prior-generation H100 chips. The company is also focusing on selling rack-scale solutions such as GB200 NVL72 \"AI factory\" systems, which bundle CPUs, GPUs, networking interconnects, and supporting software into complete AI server solutions, instead of stand-alone chips. This transition can eventually boost average selling prices and the company's margins.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, the company has introduced the Vera Rubin system, a six-chip platform designed to deliver even higher performance and power efficiency than Blackwell systems for complex AI and agentic AI workloads. With Vera Rubin currently in full production, the company expects to launch these systems in the second half of 2026. Management has highlighted cumulative revenue visibility for Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin systems of over $500 billion from the start of 2025 through the end of 2026.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, Nvidia's stock may soar in the coming years.\n\nBroadcom is also a major beneficiary of the increasing enterprise and hyperscaler spending on custom chips and high-speed networking in AI data centers.\n\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, hyperscalers are increasingly deploying custom AI server chips for specialized AI training and real-time deployment workloads. Broadcom is estimated to account for almost 60% share of this market by 2027.\n\nThat growing adoption is already translating into a multiyear backlog. Broadcom exited fiscal 2025 (ending Nov. 2, 2025) with a consolidated backlog of $162 billion, of which custom AI chips accounted for $73 billion to be delivered over the next 18 months. The company's networking switches are also seeing increased demand in AI data centers, as evidenced by the over $10 billion AI switch backlog at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nBroadcom reported a 65% year-over-year jump in AI revenues to $20 billion, driven by demand for custom chips, high-speed networking, and optical interconnects. This revenue growth trajectory can become even steeper if the company's backlog converts as expected or faster, and it has a few new multiyear client wins.\n\nHence, Broadcom can see parabolic growth even at current elevated valuation levels.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Big tech plans over $700B in AI infrastructure spending for 2026.\n\nWestern Digital (WDC) surged 466% over the past year while Seagate (STX) jumped 2.5% on memory chip shortages driving industry momentum.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nIt won't come as much of a surprise if you have been closely watching the market that shares of Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) climbed 4% over the past week, coinciding with a noticeable shift in retail investor sentiment on platforms like Reddit and X from neutral to very bullish. The memory chip maker has surged 338% over the past year, driven by AI infrastructure demand and persistent supply shortages that are pushing memory prices sharply higher. Micron's 57% year-over-year revenue growth and 28.1% profit margin reflect how tight supply and surging AI demand are creating a perfect storm for memory manufacturers.\n\nMentions of Micron on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets have surged recently, with users sharing bullish commentary and massive-gain posts. Sentiment jumped from 32 (bearish) on February 10 to 88 (very bullish) by February 13, a remarkable reversal that followed Morgan Stanley raising its price target from $350 to $450. One popular post titled \"$6k->$54k\" captured the FOMO energy driving retail interest, with the trader celebrating their successful options play on Micron's recent surge.\n\n$6k->$54k\nby\na user in\nwallstreetbets\n\nAnd there are real reasons to be optimistic:\n\nMicron is shipping HBM4 chips in volume with nearly $2 billion in Q4 revenue\n\nContract pricing has climbed 86% since December with room to double again\n\nBig tech companies are expected to spend over $700 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026\n\nIf you're spending time watching Micron make new highs almost daily, you are not alone. The broader data storage industry is experiencing explosive growth as global memory chip shortages drive prices higher. Western Digital ( NASDAQ:WDC ) has surged 466% over the past year, while Seagate Technology ( NASDAQ:STX ) jumped 2.5% on positive industry outlooks. Morgan Stanley notes that DRAM prices could double from current levels while still remaining below spot prices, signaling how constrained supply has become. For investors watching the AI infrastructure buildout, memory manufacturers like Micron are positioned at the center of a massive spending wave that shows no signs of slowing.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

      "Content": "Shares of Nvidia have lingered in a narrow trading range for months, even as global capital expenditures on artificial intelligence infrastructure continue to climb to record levels.\n\nAfter hitting record highs in late 2025, the chipmaker's stock fell nearly 2% on Friday morning, rounding off a muted six months. Nvidia's gained just under 2% since August, barely outpacing broader market indexes. By contrast, chipmakers TSMC and AMD are trading around 52% and 12% higher over the same period, respectively.\n\nBig Tech firms such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon are projected to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, a continuation of a multi-year surge in corporate investment in machine-learning compute and data centers, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nAnalysts say the disconnect reflects a broader recalibration among investors of how much future AI spending should be priced into equities, even for companies at the center of the boom.\n\n“There is perhaps growing concern that the ultimate revenue from AI will simply not keep up with the capex spend that’s been announced,” JoAnne Feeney at Advisors Capital Management told Bloomberg .\n\nDespite robust demand for Nvidia’s chips — and revenue projections that remain well above most rivals — valuation multiples have compressed. Nvidia now trades at roughly 24 times projected profits, roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 and only modestly above the S&P 500 — a discount by historic standards for a high-growth AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been left waiting for fresh earnings guidance to break the stalemate. Nvidia’s next quarterly report, due after the market closes Feb. 25, is widely viewed as a key catalyst that could determine whether the stock breaks out of its range or stays stuck.\n\nMarket watchers point to several factors behind the stagnation.\n\nAfter years of accelerated capex, analysts warn that growth in technology infrastructure spending could cool, reducing the pace of orders for data-center chips.\n\n“Capex growth is likely to moderate from these levels, which could improve investor perceptions of those doing the spending, but is a potential negative for some companies in the enabling layer,” UBS analysts wrote in a Feb 10 note.\n\nBack in November, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy foreshadowed something similar, warning that persistent capex worries could weigh on Nvidia’s performance.\n\n“The concern that AI infrastructure spending growth is not sustainable is not likely to ebb,” he told Reuters.\n\nSome investors are also worried that the massive sums being committed to AI may deliver slower returns than expected, especially as companies build out expensive facilities and power infrastructure. Plus, chipmaking competition is heating up: Google’s TPU teams and startups developing AI processors are creating alternatives to Nvidia’s dominant GPUs, adding pressure to long-term expectations, Barron's reported Friday.\n\nStill, many Wall Street strategists remain constructive on Nvidia’s position in the sector. Bullish forecasts argue that strong fundamentals — including high revenue growth and the company’s entrenched role supplying the backbone of large-scale AI systems — justify patience.\n\n“Given middling stock performance, supply chain signals that remain bullish, and a management team that seems frustrated with the prevailing doubts around growth and margin sustainability, the earnings set-up here seems positive — especially as we head toward GTC next month,” UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a Wednesday note, who recently reiterated a Buy rating and raised his price target on Nvidia.\n\nWith AI spending on track to remain a defining element of global technology strategy, the question for markets now is whether Nvidia’s share price will finally catch up to its narrative — or if investors are simply assigning a higher bar for proof of profitable returns.",

      "Content": "In August, I predicted that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) would reach at least $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030. But Netflix is down 38.6% from its 52-week high at the time of this writing, while Oracle has fallen a staggering 56.5%.\n\nNetflix's market cap is now just $346.9 billion as I write this, and Oracle is at $410.4 billion -- a far cry from joining Nvidia , Alphabet , Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Broadcom , Meta Platforms , Tesla , Berkshire Hathaway , and Walmart on the list of U.S. companies with at least $1 trillion in market cap.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nHere's why both growth stocks are under pressure, and if they are still buys now.\n\nLike many software stocks, Oracle is undergoing a steep sell-off as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts the once seemingly intractable moat of the software-as-a-service business model. But Oracle's investments are mainly centered around building out data centers for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), as well as multicloud data centers that embed its database service into third-party clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.\n\nThe market has become (rightfully) more skeptical about capital-intensive AI spending. Especially for companies like Oracle that are depending heavily on a handful of customers to fulfill order volume.\n\nOracle exited its most recent quarter with $99.98 billion in notes payable and other non-current borrowings (basically long-term debt) compared to just $19.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOn Feb. 1, Oracle announced a plan to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in gross cash proceeds in calendar year 2026 to fund the rapid expansion of OCI and meet contractual demand from companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , Meta Platforms, TikTok, and xAI. The funding will come from a mix of selling at-the-market equity, convertible preferred securities, and bonds. None of these options is good, as the interest rate won't be ideal on the bonds, and Oracle's stock price is already so beaten down.\n\nTaking on debt isn't the worst thing in the world if a company is generating enough cash flow to pay it off. But Oracle reported negative $13.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the second quarter of its fiscal 2026 compared to $9.5 billion in FCF in the same quarter from a year ago. Oracle has gone from being a high-margin cash cow to a capital-intensive money pit while it expands OCI. And that has investors worried that Oracle is betting too big on AI.\n\nThe silver lining is that spending should decline in the coming years as Oracle's capital expenditures decrease and it starts realizing revenue from its backlog. But the company is highly vulnerable to a slowdown in AI spending.\n\nIf Oracle comes even remotely close to its forecast for $144 billion in fiscal 2031 (calendar year 2030) OCI revenue, the company will likely be worth far more than $1 trillion. But it could also continue underperforming the broader indexes if it doesn't get its balance sheet under control.\n\nUnlike Oracle, which has legitimate issues challenging its investment thesis, Netflix is selling off mainly for valuation concerns and mixed reactions to its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) .\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix's valuation has come down significantly since the stock peaked at a split-adjusted intraday high of $134.12 on June 30, 2025.\n\nTrading at just 26.3 times forward earnings, Netflix is within striking distance of the S&P 500 's forward P/E of 23.6. But Netflix is a far better company than the typical S&P 500 component.\n\nNetflix generates high margins and is growing at a solid rate. The company's cash flow means it can fund its content spending without relying on debt, giving it a clear runway for compounding over time.\n\nNetflix has had tons of success with both live-action and animated series and movies, from Stranger Things to its most successful film ever, KPop Demon Hunters .\n\nAdding Warner Bros. Discovery assets would broaden Netflix's content suite and allow it to pair HBO and HBO Max programming as a dual offering with Netflix or simply bundle it into a high-octane streaming subscription.\n\nWarner Bros. is a smart acquisition, but Netflix doesn't need it to succeed. Which is why the stock is still a buy even if the deal falls through.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) have struggled so far this year, with the stock down more than 18% year-to-date (YTD) and nearly 32% below its 52-week high. Despite the significant pullback, unfavorable industry dynamics around memory supply could weigh on QCOM’s earnings. With sentiment already negative, the possibility of the stock revisiting its two-year low of $120.80 cannot be ruled out.\n\nQualcomm delivered better-than-expected Q1 financial numbers. Revenue of $12.3 billion rose 5% YoY and slightly exceeded consensus expectations, reflecting steady demand across key end markets. The Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) segment delivered $1.6 billion in revenue with a strong EBT margin, supported by higher unit volumes and a favorable product mix.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nThe core Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) business posted revenue of $10.6 billion, driven by demand across smartphones, automotive, and IoT markets. Handset revenues within QCT climbed to a record $7.8 billion, benefiting from the launch cycle of premium flagship devices. IoT revenue grew 9% YoY to $1.7 billion, driven by consumer and networking applications, while automotive revenue reached $1.1 billion, up 15%, as adoption of Snapdragon Digital Chassis platforms accelerated.\n\nIts adjusted EPS of $3.50 rose 3% YoY and surpassed expectations.\n\nThe market’s negative reaction to QCOM stock reflects management’s weak guidance. Management guided for second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.45 to $2.65, both below Wall Street expectations. This raised concerns that near-term headwinds will likely weigh on its growth.\n\nThe most significant challenge impacting Qualcomm's growth is the uncertainty in global memory markets. Surging demand for memory solutions, led by AI data centers, has diverted supply away from smartphones, driving higher prices for handset manufacturers. This has been especially disruptive in China, where OEMs are responding by scaling back production plans and tightening inventory management.\n\nWhile Qualcomm maintains that the fundamental demand environment for handsets remains intact, highlighting better-than-expected global shipments in the December quarter and a strong Snapdragon design win pipeline, the near-term outlook remains cautious. OEMs are adjusting build plans downward to manage cost pressures, and Qualcomm is seeing reduced chipset orders as a result.\n\nFor the second quarter, Qualcomm forecasts QCT handset revenues of $6 billion, reflecting a sharp sequential decline. While management expects QCT handset revenues to return to their prior growth trajectory once memory supply and pricing normalize. However, until visibility into memory availability improves and OEM production plans stabilize, Qualcomm’s earnings may remain under pressure. That uncertainty helps explain why the shares have continued to slide despite solid underlying execution.\n\nWhile the company’s handset revenues could continue to face near-term pressure, management has pointed to meaningful strength in other businesses.\n\nQualcomm’s QCT IoT revenue is projected to grow by a low teens percentage YoY. That growth will likely be driven by expanding demand across both industrial and consumer IoT applications. Further, the momentum in the QCT automotive business will be sustained. Qualcomm anticipates YoY revenue growth accelerating to more than 35% in the second fiscal quarter.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, QCOM stock appears inexpensive at 16.3 times forward earnings. However, that multiple fails to attract. Analysts expect QCOM’s earnings to decline 14.7% in fiscal 2026, and there is still limited visibility into a meaningful reacceleration in fiscal 2027. With handset revenues under pressure and earnings momentum weakening, Qualcomm's stock could still remain under pressure.\n\nAnalysts maintain a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating on QCOM stock. However, if memory constraints persist longer than expected, the risk of Qualcomm shares drifting toward their two-year low increases.\n\nOn the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

But here's the paradox: Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) stock has struggled despite this thesis, up just 0.24% year-to-date while the broader AI infrastructure buildout accelerates. Let's explore what's going on and why stocks like Broadcom ( Nasdaq: AVGO ), Micron ( Nasdaq: MU ), and Bloom Energy ( Nasdaq: BE ) have seen stronger recent gains.\n\nHyperscaler spending is concentrated among the mega-cap tech giants. Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon are deploying massive capital into AI infrastructure and cloud computing, with Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's AWS competing for AI workload dominance. Together, these hyperscalers are funding the largest technology infrastructure expansion in history.\n\nSecondary spending comes from 'neoclouds' like CoreWeave and Nebius , while other projects like sovereign AI data centers add even more fuel to the rapidly growing spending pie.\n\nNvidia should be the obvious winner. The company has seen explosive Data Center growth, with AI revenue exponentially growing across training and inference. Yet the stock trades at $186.94, essentially flat for the year. The market seems to be pricing in execution risk or questioning whether $700 billion in CapEx translates to sustained GPU demand beyond the initial buildout phase.\n\nPersonally, I'm betting this is a mistake on Wall Street's part. NVIDIA is my largest personal position, and I own it in the $500,000 portfolio I manage as part of 24/7 Wall Street's AI Investor Podcast. Since we first recommended a buy of NVIDIA on 9/12/2024, shares are up 55%. That's a healthy return in a year and a half for stock that was considered 'overbought' at the time by most of the media.\n\nStill, you might be wondering what other stocks benefit from this $700 billion buildout beyond NVIDIA. Here are some stocks to consider.\n\nThe $700 billion wave creates opportunities across the entire supply chain. These picks-and-shovels plays are seeing explosive growth as AI infrastructure spending accelerates.\n\nBroadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ) is capturing custom chip demand, with strong AI semiconductor revenue growth driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. The stock is up 41% over the past year. We first recommended it in the $500,000 Portfolio on October 11, 2024 and later re-recommended it. Both recommendations are up more than 80%.\n\nBroadcom shares are down 4% year-to-date despite its primary customer Google announcing $185 billion in capex, a number that was more than 50% above analyst expectations.\n\nOptical components are seeing explosive growth. Lumentum ( NASDAQ:LITE ) has seen strong data center and long-haul momentum, with optical circuit switches and co-packaged optics as next growth engines. The stock has surged 637% over the past year.\n\nWe first recommended it in the AI Portfolio on 11/8/2024 and shares are up 590% since. We've pounded the table since, such as when we brought on an optics expert on our March 28th episode last year titled 'These Optical Stocks Could Be Set to Ride an Optical Supercycle.'\n\nMemory is another winner. Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) has seen AI memory demand driving record results as the only US-based memory manufacturer. The stock is up 353% over the past year. Once again, we recommended Micron before its most significant gains. Our January 17th recommendation last year is now up 292%.\n\nPower infrastructure plays are emerging. Bloom Energy ( NYSE:BE ) has seen strong momentum addressing AI data center power demands, with product backlog growing significantly. The stock has jumped 492% over the past year. Bloom Energy isn't a stock we've recommended in our $500,000 AI Portfolio, but it could make the cut when we record our next episode.\n\nIf you're looking for other stocks that could benefit from the $700 billion buildout, make sure to subscribe to the AI Investor Podcast. On our next episode, we're issuing a series of new buy recommendations. It's absolutely free to subscribe and get each new idea. So far, our average recommendation is up 87%!\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are.

      "Content": "Astera Labs ALAB shares have plunged 30.8% since it reported fourth-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday. The decline was due to a slight decrease in non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2025, which dropped 70 basis points sequentially to 75.7% compared to the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributed to a higher mix of hardware sales.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins also fell 150 basis points sequentially to 40.2%, driven by a $16 million increase in operating expenses due to the expansion of the R&D organization, including the aiXscale acquisition.\n\nALAB’s shares have also plunged 33.6% in the trailing six-month period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 10.3% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of 20.3% over the same time frame. The underperformance can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition in the PCIe retimers market.\n\nHowever, the company is benefiting from its robust and diversified product portfolio to address the growing demands of AI infrastructure and connectivity solutions, as well as its expanding partner base. It benefits from strong demand for its PCIe solutions, which have also been a major growth driver.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ product portfolio, including Scorpio, Aries, and Taurus, has been a key catalyst. In the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB started increasing production of its Scorpio X-Series lead platform.\n\nThe company also expanded the Smart Fabric Switch roadmap with hyperscaler partners, adding new features to meet the needs of next-generation scale-up networking. Early interest from customers is pushing more investment into the quickly growing merchant scale-up switching market, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB expanded its product portfolio with custom NVLink Fusion connectivity solutions designed with hyperscaler partners to optimize heterogeneous AI infrastructure performance, improve energy efficiency, and reduce cost across diverse next-generation AI workloads.\n\nALAB’s expanding portfolio underpins the company’s expectation that its served addressable market opportunity will expand by more than 10x over the next five years to reach $25 billion. This growth is expected to be driven by its copper-based product families, including Aries and Taurus signal conditioning solutions, Scorpio AI fabric switches, Leo CXL Memory Controllers, and custom solutions for scale-up connectivity.\n\nAster Lab is benefiting from strong demand for its Aries, Taurus, and Scorpio product families, all of which are expected to drive growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAstera Labs expects first-quarter 2026 revenues between $286 million and $297 million. Earnings are expected to be between 53 cents and 54 cents per share for the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure calls for a year-over-year increase of 57.58%.\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Astera Labs, Inc. Quote\n\nDespite an expanding portfolio and strong partner base, ALAB is facing stiff competition from other industry players like Marvell Technology MRVL, Credo Technology CRDO, and Broadcom AVGO in the connectivity space.\n\nMarvell Technology is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. Marvell Technology recently completed its acquisition of Celestial AI, strengthening its scale-up optical connectivity capabilities for large-scale AI deployments.\n\nCredo Technology is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market with a healthy pipeline of PCIe Gen6 AECs and retimers, with further customer wins expected to support fiscal 2026 growth. Credo Technology’s shares have rallied 3.8% in the trailing six-month period.\n\nBroadcom is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market by developing advanced solutions that enhance signal quality and extend the reach of PCIe connections in high-speed data environments. Broadcom shares have surged 50.3% in the trailing 12-month period.\n\nAstera Labs’ stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 17.67X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.51X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ strong fundamentals, expanding partnerships, and rising AI demand reinforce its leadership in connectivity solutions. However, challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition remain a headwind. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.\n\nAstera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

The startup’s core tech is its Command family of generative AI models, which Cohere says are efficient enough to be deployed on limited GPUs — an attractive promise for enterprises looking to get a handle on cost and resource management.\n\nLast summer, Cohere launched North , a higher-level enterprise platform and AI workspace for secure, custom AI agents and workflows built on Cohere’s models.\n\nCohere’s CEO Aidan Gomez said last October that the startup may IPO “soon.” If “soon” means in 2026, Cohere may be contending against OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX/xAI, which are all reportedly weighing their own public debuts.\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to Cohere for comment.",

      "Content": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\n\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\n\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\n\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\n\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\n\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\n\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target. The company's AI application-specific integrated circuits exposure does not warrant a premium multiple versus market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA) , the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of TSMC (TSM) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm sees a \"compounding execution moat\" for the company in leading edge manufacturing.",

      "Title": "Is It Worth Investing in Analog Devices (ADI) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-analog-devices-adi-143004519.html",
      "Content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.52 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.7% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Analog Devices, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.9% over the past month to $9.97.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices.

      "Content": "Investing.com -- D.A. Davidson initiated coverage of four major semiconductor names, AMD, Intel, Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in notes to clients on Thursday, with only one receiving a Buy rating.\n\nAnalyst Gil Luria initiated coverage of the group, pointing to diverging competitive positions.\n\nOn Broadcom , D.A. Davidson stated that the company is “sitting on a shrinking iceberg” as hyperscalers increasingly favour customised accelerators.\n\nThe firm warned that the largest of customers could internalise more of their silicon stack, ultimately “pressuring supplier economics.” Luria believes Broadcom’s AI ASIC exposure does not justify “a premium multiple versus market leaders such as NVIDIA,” initiating the stock at Neutral with a $335 price target.\n\nIntel was also started at Neutral. D.A. Davidson said “it wouldn’t be an overstatement to claim that Intel is attempting one of the hardest resets in semiconductor history,” arguing the company must rebuild leading-edge process capability while proving itself as a third-party foundry.\n\nWhile noting “real developments” in the business, the firm said Intel remains “the ultimate ‘show me’ story,” and set a $45 price target.\n\nAMD received a Neutral rating as well. D.A. Davidson said AMD is “a marginal AI accelerator player … in the act of playing catch-up,” despite strength in CPUs. The firm initiated with a $220 price target.\n\nFinally, TSMC was the lone Buy. Luria said the company’s leading-edge execution represents “a durable, self-reinforcing advantage” as AI compute demand expands. He also highlighted “a compounding execution moat in leading edge manufacturing.” The analyst assigned TSM a $450 price target.\n\nRelated articles\n\nD.A.

      "Content": "Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU ) stock is trading higher Wednesday after Morgan Stanley reiterated its Overweight rating and boosted its price target from $350 to $450. Here’s what you should know .\n\nAnalyst Joseph Moore pointed to continued DRAM price strength and persistent supply shortages as the main reasons behind the improved outlook, Investing.com reported.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nBefore the IPO: How One Company Quietly Locked Up 500+ Iconic Character Rights\n\nMorgan Stanley noted that mainstream DRAM prices could double again and still remain more than 10% below current spot levels, which continue to trend upward. Contract pricing has already climbed 86% since December, and the firm says buyers who waited too long to secure inventory are now paying close to high teens ASP per GB.\n\nMicron is also preparing to announce a new investment in memory‑chip manufacturing capacity in Singapore, focused on NAND flash production, signaling that the company expects long‑term demand to remain strong, according to the report.\n\nSee Also: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\nMicron Technology has recently received favorable ratings from several analysts, with most maintaining an optimistic outlook. Similarly to Morgan Stanley’s rating, Mizuho kept its Outperform rating, increasing the target from $390 to $480 on Jan. 27.\n\nOther significant rating actions include William Blair initiating coverage with an Outperform rating on Jan. 22. In addition, TD Cowen and Stifel both maintained their Buy ratings on Jan. 20. TD Cowen set a new target of $450, up from $300, while Stifel raised its target from $300 to $360.

      "Content": "「我自己投資台股、美股，長期報酬不是更高嗎？」「而且勞退要等到退休才能領，資金完全被鎖住。」這是多數上班族面對勞退自提 6% 時的第一個疑問。勞退自提 6% 到底是不是一個「一定要做」的選擇？還是其實只適合某些人？\n1. 勞退基金是什麼？自提 6% 是什麼意思？\n依《勞工退休金條例》規定，雇主每月必須為勞工提繳薪資 6%，存入個人退休專戶，由勞動部勞動基金運用局統一管理，屬於個人帳戶制，就算公司倒閉也不影響這筆資金，離職後也仍會持續累積。 在雇主提繳之外，勞工可再自願提繳 1%～6% 的薪資，這就是所謂的「勞退自提」。自提金額不計入當年度薪資所得課稅，即稅前扣除，並設有最低收益保障機制，保證比定存好， 但資金須等符合法定退休條件後才能動用，且投資標的由政府統一運作。因此，自提 6% 的本質，是一種結合稅務優惠與強制儲蓄機制的退休準備工具。\n\n2. 什麼時候可以領？怎麼領？\n\n請領退休金課稅方式\n年滿 60 歲即可請領。年資不同，能選的領法不同：提繳年資滿 15 年以上：可選月領或一次領；未滿 15 年：原則一次領。\n「一次領」與「分期領（月領）」的差別在課稅方式不同。簡單說， 一次領是用「年資」去算免稅門檻，領越多、超過門檻的部分才會被計入所得；分期領則是每年先扣一個固定免稅額，超過的部分才算所得。\n舉例來說，假設工作 30 年退休，並選擇一次領取。免稅額度 = 19.8 萬 x 30 年 = 594 萬元。只要領取的退休金總額沒超過 594 萬元，就不須繳稅；若超過則按照級距有半額課稅或全額課稅的差別。如果選擇每月請領，免稅額度是看全年的請領總額，若不超過 85.9 萬元，則免課稅，一般來說這是不容易達到的課稅門檻。若好奇以目前薪資做自提，在退休後可以領到多少金額可以到 勞動部 網站做試算。\n3. 自提 6% vs 自己投資差在哪？\n我們直接用 2004 年至 2024 年的歷史實際資料來回測。假設每月投資 6,000 元，持續 20 年，分成兩種情境比較：第一種是每月把 6,000 元全額自提進勞退帳戶；第二種是不自提，而是把每月 6,000 元扣除當年度所得稅後的實際可投資金額，定期定額分別投資於台股、美股與美國科技股。\n從結果來看，成長型市場在這 20 年間確實累積出明顯優勢。即使在 40% 高稅率下，美國科技股約 833 萬元，仍高於勞退的 361 萬元，顯示報酬率對最終成果的影響相當關鍵。不過，隨著稅率提高，差距會逐步縮小。以台股為例，5% 稅率下最終約 738 萬元，但 40% 稅率時降至 466 萬元，與勞退 361 萬元的距離明顯拉近。 原因在於稅率越高，稅後可投入的本金越少，自提「完整投入」的優勢便開始浮現。因此，成長型資產決定長期累積速度，而稅率高低則影響起跑點。當稅率達 20% 以上時，自提的節稅優勢逐漸明顯化。\n不過，必須注意股票有崩盤並賠掉本金的風險，而勞退基金依法有「保證收益機制」 ，政府承諾就算勞退基金操盤賠得亂七八糟，最後結算給你的收益，絕對不會低於銀行定存利率。換句話說，這是一筆保證不賠本的投資。\n勞退自提與扣除稅率後投入股市的累積金額相比\n4. 我適合自提 6% 嗎？\n在討論自提之前，更重要的其實是檢視自己的理財習慣。如果單純追求長期報酬最大化，不自提、將扣稅後的資金持續投入高成長股市，理論上確實可能累積出更高的金額。但這個前提包含幾個條件：你能選到合適的標的、未來市場能延續過去的成長趨勢，以及你能在市場波動甚至大幅下跌時，仍然堅持定期定額、不恐慌贖回。此外，還有一個更現實的問題：每個月薪水發下來後，這筆原本打算投資的錢，是否真的會被確實投入，而不是被日常開銷慢慢侵蝕？\n如果你是一位具備良好投資紀律 、能長期執行計畫且能承受波動的投資人， 自行投資確實更具潛在成長空間 。但 如果對自己的執行力沒有那麼有把握 ，或擔心情緒影響決策，那麼 勞退自提的價值就在於把紀律制度化 。薪資尚未入帳即完成提撥，既節稅又強制儲蓄，讓退休準備成為一個穩定、持續的過程。\n再進一步來看， 如果你的適用稅率達 20% 以上 時，自提屬於稅前扣除，節稅效果會隨稅率提高而放大，對高稅率族群而言， 自提的優勢更加明顯 ；若 稅率較低，則節稅效益有限，建議優先建立緊急預備金與基本投資配置 ，再評估是否提高自提比例。\n鉅亨投資策略\n該不該自提 6%？依稅率與紀律做出適合的選擇\n若單純追求長期報酬最大化，自行投資高成長市場通常更具優勢；但若考量稅務效率、強制儲蓄與資產穩定性，自提 6% 仍有其制度價值。第一，先檢視自己的稅率與現金流狀況。第二，評估自身是否具備長期投資紀律與風險承受能力。第三，將自提視為退休配置的一部分，而非全部。成熟的退休規劃，不是二選一，而是在成長與穩定之間取得平衡。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nA20106\n富邦 NASDAQ-100 指數基金 (本基金之配息來源可能為本金及收益平準金)\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "這兩週市場同時遭受 AI 海嘯、利率轉向與政治黑天鵝接連衝擊。美國聯準會立場轉鷹，川普提名前理事華許接掌聯準會主席，加上英國工黨面臨執政危機，以及日本高市早苗政府在大選勝出後，形同獲得一張擴張財政與強硬外交的空白支票。同時，從比特幣到白銀都在上演高台跳水，投資人忽然想起本益比三個字。當股匯債與原物料同步劇烈波動，這波震盪到底是短期情緒，還是新一輪景氣與政策循環的序曲？\n1. 利率與聯準會市場從等降息變成別作夢\n\n鮑爾在一月會議後明確表示經濟明顯改善且就業穩健，等於把上半年降息空間先行封鎖，聯邦基金期貨也乖乖把降息預期往後延。川普拋出凱文華許作為新任聯準會主席提名人選，市場開始重新計算未來利率路徑與美元走勢。降息不再是何時開始，而是會不會比想像中更少。在這種情況下，高估值科技股首當其衝，標普五百與那斯達克連日回檔。避險情緒升高卻無處躲避，連黃金都被追繳保證金的賣壓波及，提醒投資人利率週期尚未轉向。\n\n2. AI 熱潮與科技股從萬能解答變成估值殺手\nAI 依舊是故事主角，但這回是以反派姿態上場。Anthropic 推出新工具後，市場開始認真計算如果 AI 能寫程式、審合約與處理資料，那些靠人力與訂閱服務生存的軟體公司，未來利潤如何支撐股價？結果美國軟體股單日蒸發 2,850 億美元市值。另一邊 SpaceX 收購 xAI，Meta 與甲骨文大舉投入重金建置 AI 基礎設施，說明資本支出仍在加碼，但股價卻因利率與估值承壓。簡單說 AI 長期前景亮眼，短期卻淪為回檔藉口，尤其是漲多的美股科技龍頭。\n3. 地緣政治與政策英日劇烈轉向、川習再度交鋒\n政治局勢完全沒有平息跡象。英國工黨幕僚長請辭，首相史塔默的人事與外交任命陷入風暴，執政穩定性遭質疑，英鎊與英國資產面臨折價風險。相反地日本眾議院選舉讓高市早苗大勝，市場解讀為日本將大開財政大門。擴張財政、國防支出與更鷹派的外交路線，對日股與日債殖利率都是強烈訊號。川普與習近平通話再度把焦點拉回貿易與台海，從大豆、石油到軍事溝通，全都牽動資金對台灣與中國資產的風險溢酬定價。中東方面，美伊在阿曼預備重啟核談，若有進展，能源供給風險可望緩和，但在那之前，油價仍對任何飛彈或談判破局高度敏感。\n4. 資產波動加密貨幣、高貴金屬與飆過頭的銅\n在利率高檔震盪與 AI 泡沫疑慮雙重壓力下，風險資產首先重挫。比特幣單日重挫約一成，白銀一度暴跌兩成，黃金也被拖下水，說明這一輪不是避險買盤，而是去槓桿化。同時前一波在中國投機資金推升下大漲的銅價，也被重新檢驗基本面。中國製造業 PMI 再度掉回預警區間，地方財政與信用風險消息不斷，讓中國需求復甦這個論點顯得底氣不足。相較之下，台灣因 AI 供應鏈帶動，上調成長預測。美日股也在震盪中維持中長期成長趨勢。市場開始用更苛刻但理性的眼光，選擇繼續追求成長或先保留現金。\n鉅亨投資策略\n在震盪中聚焦核心資產，避免盲目進場\n在利率延長賽與 AI 估值修正下，美股、日股與台股因經濟與產業結構具備成長動能，中長期持續看好，但短期需接受劇烈波動，特別是高本益比科技股的修正過程。大宗商品方面，貴金屬與工業金屬近期價格大起大落，既反映槓桿去化，也暴露出市場對全球需求的疑慮，配置上建議相對保守，以避險與分散投資為主，而非短線追價。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nB15112\n富蘭克林坦伯頓 - 日本\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "Got some idle money you're ready to put to work for a while? Is there $1,000 you have available (or any amount, really) that you'd like to turn into something more? That's easier said than done right now. Too many stocks have demonstrated a bit too much vulnerability of late. Another wave of weakness feels possible.\n\nNot every name is uncomfortably risky here, however. Even if the market does get upended again, a few stocks are apt to hold up well enough and then enjoy more than their fair share of any recovery. Here's a rundown of three of these names.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nQualcomm 's (NASDAQ: QCOM) 23% share price pullback from its early January peak makes enough superficial sense. Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\n\nPayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\n\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\n\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\n\nFinally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\n\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $492,937 !*\n\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $52,460 !*\n\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $429,385 !*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee the 3 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 9, 2026\n\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends PayPal, Qualcomm, and The Trade Desk. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2027 $42.50 calls on PayPal and short March 2026 $65 calls on PayPal.

      "Content": "Analog Devices (ADI) closed the most recent trading day at $331.36, moving -1.67% from the previous trading session. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.57%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.34%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 2.04%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the semiconductor maker had gained 13.09% outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 1.83% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.29%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Analog Devices will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on February 18, 2026. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.3, signifying a 41.10% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.12 billion, up 28.67% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nADI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.97 per share and revenue of $12.97 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +27.98% and +17.73%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Analog Devices. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.92% higher. Analog Devices is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nDigging into valuation, Analog Devices currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 33.81. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 41.23 for its industry.\n\nAlso, we should mention that ADI has a PEG ratio of 1.83. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As the market closed yesterday, the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.49.\n\nThe Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 62, which puts it in the top 26% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Never miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\n\nAnalog Devices (NasdaqGS:ADI) has responded to a shareholder proposal seeking changes to special meeting rights.\n\nThe company is urging investors to vote against the proposal and is pointing to prior changes that lowered the threshold for calling special meetings.\n\nManagement is highlighting its broader governance approach, including a stated focus on shareholder rights and board accountability.\n\nAnalog Devices, known for its analog and mixed signal semiconductors used in industrial, automotive and communications applications, is putting governance firmly in focus with this response. For you as an investor, special meeting rights touch on how quickly shareholders can react when material issues arise. This can be relevant alongside fundamentals like balance sheet strength or end market exposure.\n\nBy stressing both the existing special meeting terms and its stance on accountability, Analog Devices is signaling how it wants to manage shareholder influence over major decisions. As you weigh NasdaqGS:ADI, this type of governance disclosure can sit alongside product mix, customer concentration and capital allocation policies when you think about overall risk and oversight quality.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Analog Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Analog Devices.\n\nSee which insiders are buying and buying and selling Analog Devices following this latest news.\n\nThis governance update is really about where the balance of power sits between ADI’s board and its shareholders. By urging investors to vote against a further expansion of special meeting rights, the company is arguing that the current 25% threshold already offers meaningful influence while limiting the risk that a small group can force company specific events onto the calendar. For you, this is a signal about how ADI prefers to manage activist pressure and board accountability at a time when interest in the stock has been reinforced by recent earnings beats and positive analyst sentiment. It also shapes how long term holders might think about stability, especially when management is already committing capital to areas such as buybacks and growth investments in data centers, autos and industrial markets.\n\nThe company’s emphasis on “long term shareholder value” and governance discipline aligns with the narrative that ADI is positioning for autos, AI and automation, where consistent execution and board oversight can support multi year product and R&D plans.\n\nCalls from some shareholders to loosen special meeting rights could challenge that narrative if they signal impatience with capital allocation choices or with how quickly ADI is pursuing opportunities in areas such as AI infrastructure.\n\nThe investor presentation on special meeting rights adds a governance dimension that is not explicitly covered in the narrative, which mainly focuses on end markets, earnings potential and capital deployment rather than how shareholder rights might influence those plans.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Analog Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ A shareholder base that is pushing for easier special meetings may be a sign of rising activism risk, which can lead to distractions for management or pressure for short term moves that do not match your own time horizon.\n\n⚠️ If some investors view ADI’s stance as too protective of the board, it could create governance related criticism, especially when peers such as Texas Instruments, NXP or Microchip adopt different approaches to shareholder rights.\n\n🎁 The existing 25% threshold is lower than the prior 80% requirement and may help ADI maintain operational focus while still giving a sizeable group of shareholders the ability to act when they see material issues.\n\n🎁 Clear communication that the board is focused on accountability and long term value can support confidence for investors who are already watching ADI’s earnings momentum and analyst interest in its data center and auto exposure.\n\nYou will want to see how the vote on the proposal turns out and whether support for the shareholder resolution is high enough to suggest persistent governance pressure. Watch for any follow up from large holders or governance advisory firms, as their reaction can shape future proposals or board engagement. It is also worth tracking how ADI’s board decisions on capital returns, acquisitions and R&D align with this message about long term value, especially compared with peers in the analog and mixed signal space that face similar investor activism.\n\nTo stay informed on how the latest news affects the investment narrative for Analog Devices, visit the community page for Analog Devices to keep up with the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nTD Cowen upgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $159, citing valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 30% year-to-date. Shopify's \"strong\" quarter, continued growth momentum and the post-earnings pullback \"represents an attractive entry point for investors to own the de facto modern-day eCommerce infrastructure,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho also upgraded Shopify to Outperform from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $150.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded BorgWarner (BWA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $82, up from $46. The firm says the company's entrance into the AI data center market is a \"pivotal shift.\"\n\nBarclays upgraded Analog Devices (ADI) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $375, up from $315. The company has the highest industrial exposure within the analog group \"by far\" and a strong correlation between its sales growth and the Purchasing Managers' Index, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nJPMorgan upgraded MercadoLibre (MELI) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $2,800, up from $2,650. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade following the stock's recent underperformance.\n\nWilliam Blair upgraded Fastly (FSLY) to Outperform from Market Perform without a price target. The company reported a \"stellar\" quarter driven by rising contribution from agentic AI traffic, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nMonness Crespi downgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Sell from Buy with a $120 price target as the firm is cutting estimates \"again\" ahead of the company's Q4 report. The firm says its prior assumption of a steady recovery over the course of calendar 2026 was \"foolish\" given the typical length and magnitude of crypto bear markets, telling investors that it now models softness through the first half of 2026 and sets its calendar 2026 and 2027 estimates below the Street view.\n\nJPMorgan downgraded Kraft Heinz (KHC) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $22, down from $24. The company reported a Q4 beat but its 2026 organic sales growth and earnings outlooks were below consensus estimates, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nBofA downgraded Icon (ICLR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $75, down from $195, after the company announced an internal board investigation into accounting practices and controls and noted that preliminary indications are that the company may have overstated revenues in 2023-2024 by up to 2% each fiscal year. Leerink also downgraded Icon but to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $105, down from $220.\n\nWells Fargo downgraded Inspire Medical (INSP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $70, down from $145. The firm says that while significant downside risk to Inspire's 2026 revenue seems less likely with its IV system availability, there is too much uncertainty about physician reimbursement that is likely to remain an overhang on shares for some time. Baird also downgraded Inspire Medical to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $74, down from $130.\n\nRBC Capital downgraded Humana (HUM) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $189, down from $322. Given the company's \"outsized growth\" in an uncertain reimbursement backdrop, RBC sees a balanced risk/reward setup for Humana shares at the current multiple.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nBarclays initiated coverage of Microchip (MCHP) with an Equal Weight rating and $80 price target. The firm believes Microchip is at risk of losing share in microcontrollers.\n\nBarclays initiated coverage of On Semi (ON) with an Equal Weight rating and $75 price target. On Semi's high China and auto exposure are \"well understood\" overhangs on the shares, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nStifel initiated coverage of Sterling Infrastructure (STRL) with a Buy rating and $486 price target. As the largest excavating contractor in the U.S., the firm likes Sterling's \"outsized exposure\" to secular growth themes, including AI and cloud computing, onshoring, and e-commerce.\n\nTD Cowen initiated coverage of D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) with a Buy rating and no price target. The company's leadership in quantum annealing is driving growth and high margins, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nH.C. Wainwright initiated coverage of Immunome (IMNM) with a Buy rating and $40 price target. The company is building a portfolio of \"best-in-class, pipeline-in-a-product oncology assets with meaningful differentiation across both validated and underpenetrated solid tumor and hematologic indications,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.",

      "Content": "Investing.com -- Barclays upgraded Analog Devices to Overweight in a note Thursday, arguing the company is best positioned to benefit from an improving industrial backdrop and carries “the cleanest operating model and balance sheet” in the group.\n\nAnalyst Tom O’Malley said purchasing manager indexes have finally provided “the PMI inflection needed for some broader Industrial recovery,” though he cautioned that scars remain from the last cycle.\n\nBarclays noted that inventories at distributors have normalised, but “company inventories remain historically high impacting loadings and utilization, and impairing margins.”\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the bank sees emerging growth tied to data-center trends but remains selective across analog names. O’Malley wrote that ADI has “the most leverage to Industrial exposure,” making it the most attractive way to position for an upturn.\n\nBy contrast, Barclays initiated Microchip at Equal Weight, noting the company is exposed to networking and memory demand from AI data-center buildouts but faces challenges including “a difficult spot from a leverage perspective” and “share loss in low end MCUs.”\n\nThe bank assigned the stock an $80 price target.\n\nBarclays also started coverage of ON Semiconductor at Equal Weight with a $75 target, citing upside from rising data-center dollar content in the move to 800-volt architectures.\n\nHowever, O’Malley said the stock cannot “break out” without a broader recovery in auto demand, which “remains mum for foreseeable future.”\n\nBarclays added that each company in the group faces at least one industry-specific challenge, reinforcing its preference for ADI’s mix of industrial leverage and balance-sheet strength.\n\nRelated articles\n\nBarclays upgrades Analog Devices as industrial recovery takes shape\n\nThese 2 stocks are best positioned to benefit from higher uranium prices: analyst\n\n5 reasons why Jefferies thinks Meta’s pullback is a buying opportunity",

      "Content": "The most recent earnings report from QUALCOMM Incorporated ( NASDAQ:QCOM ) was disappointing for shareholders. However, our analysis suggests that the soft headline numbers are getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nAs finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\n\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nQUALCOMM has an accrual ratio of -0.29 for the year to December 2025. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$13b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$5.37b. Over the last year, QUALCOMM's free cash flow remained steady.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nHappily for shareholders, QUALCOMM produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that QUALCOMM's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of QUALCOMM.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of QUALCOMM's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

      "Content": "Track your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\n\nCadence Design Systems (NasdaqGS:CDNS) has introduced the ChipStack AI Super Agent, described as a first-of-its-kind agentic AI solution for front-end silicon design and verification.\n\nThe platform uses multiple virtual engineers powered by Cadence’s existing EDA tools, with the company indicating potential productivity gains of up to tenfold in chip design workflows.\n\nEarly adoption by Nvidia and Qualcomm, along with Cadence’s investment in robotics AI, points to growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to semiconductor and intelligent device development.\n\nFor you as an investor, this update sits at the intersection of electronic design automation and accelerating AI chip development. Cadence Design Systems, through its core EDA software and AI driven workflows, plays a role in how complex processors and systems on chip move from concept to tape out. As chipmakers look for ways to manage design complexity and time to market, tools that automate front-end design and verification are increasingly central to their operations.\n\nThe ChipStack AI Super Agent and the company’s robotics AI focus may influence how Cadence positions itself with customers building next generation AI centric hardware and intelligent devices. As you evaluate NasdaqGS:CDNS, it can be useful to watch how widely ChipStack is deployed, how it fits alongside competing design flows, and how customers integrate these AI agents into their broader engineering processes.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Cadence Design Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Cadence Design Systems.\n\nWe've flagged 0 risks for Cadence Design Systems. See which could impact your investment.\n\nThis launch pushes Cadence further into AI-powered automation for chip design, an area where it already has a deep presence through tools like Verisium, Cerebrus and the JedAI platform. By coordinating multiple virtual engineers across coding, test creation, regression, debugging and auto fixes, ChipStack is aimed directly at the cost and time bottlenecks that large chipmakers care about most. Early use by Nvidia, Qualcomm and others is a signal that key customers see value in tighter AI integration across their existing Cadence workflows rather than standalone tools. For you, the key question is whether ChipStack can move from early access to broad, paid deployment across those accounts and beyond, which could influence how sticky Cadence’s platform is versus rivals such as Synopsys and Siemens EDA.\n\nThe ChipStack launch lines up with the narrative that AI-driven design tools and partnerships with large chipmakers can support future revenue growth, especially as customers look for higher productivity in advanced AI and high-performance-compute designs.\n\nIf ChipStack requires heavier R&D and cloud infrastructure spending to support complex agentic workflows at scale, it could challenge expectations for steadily rising profit margins over time.\n\nThe narrative focuses on AI design tools and IP demand but gives less attention to Cadence’s push into robotics AI and Physical AI via investments such as Trener Robotics, which could add another leg to the long-term story if it gains traction.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Cadence Design Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\nHigher dependence on large AI-chip customers such as Nvidia and Qualcomm could increase Cadence’s exposure if those relationships weaken or design cycles slow.\n\nCompetitive responses from Synopsys, Siemens EDA or newer AI-tool vendors could pressure pricing or limit how much ChipStack adoption Cadence ultimately achieves.\n\nChipStack aims to deliver up to 10x productivity gains in front-end design and verification, which could strengthen Cadence’s value proposition and support premium pricing for its broader EDA stack.\n\nEarly use across several leading chip designers and a reported multi billion dollar backlog suggest Cadence is already embedded in critical AI and data-center projects, giving it a platform to cross sell new AI agents.\n\nFrom here, keep an eye on how often management references ChipStack wins in future updates, especially any comments on seat growth, usage-based revenues or expansion within existing top customers. Watch for signs of competitive products from other EDA vendors and whether customers are standardising on agent-based design flows or treating them as optional add ons.

      "Content": "Get insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\n\nIntel (NasdaqGS:INTC) is committing at least US$100 million to AI chip startup SambaNova Systems.\n\nThe company has also appointed former Qualcomm executive Eric Demers as its new Chief GPU Architect.\n\nBoth moves reflect a shift in how Intel is approaching AI chips and GPU development.\n\nIntel, known for its x86 processors and data center products, is increasingly tied to demand for AI computing across cloud, enterprise, and edge use cases. The SambaNova investment adds capital to a specialist in AI hardware and software, at a time when dedicated AI chips have become an important focus for chipmakers.\n\nFor you as an investor, these steps highlight where Intel is trying to compete more directly in AI accelerators and GPUs, rather than relying only on its existing CPU franchise. The combination of external investment and a new GPU leader may lead to product and partnership changes that you can monitor over upcoming product cycles.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Intel by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\n\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 2 things going right for Intel that every investor should see.\n\nFor Intel, putting at least US$100 million into SambaNova and hiring Eric Demers looks like a move to close gaps in AI accelerators and high performance GPUs, where Nvidia and AMD currently set the pace. SambaNova gives Intel closer access to AI-specific chip design and software stacks, while Demers brings experience from another large chipmaker in building competitive GPU roadmaps. Together, these steps point to Intel trying to serve hyperscalers that are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI data centers, not just with CPUs and foundry capacity but with a fuller portfolio of accelerators. The flip side is execution risk. Intel is already investing heavily in new manufacturing nodes and materials, and layering a deeper AI chip push on top of that raises questions about focus, timelines and returns on capital. If Intel can coordinate its CPU, GPU, custom AI silicon and foundry efforts around what large cloud and enterprise buyers actually want, this news could represent a meaningful evolution of its data center business model. If that coordination does not materialize, it could simply add complexity without a clear payoff.\n\nThe SambaNova investment and Demers hire align with the narrative that Intel is refocusing on AI workloads and foundry partnerships, potentially supporting the idea that a clearer product roadmap can improve competitiveness and customer trust.\n\nThese moves also test the concern that organizational complexity and slow AI adaptation can hold Intel back, because successfully integrating an external startup and a senior GPU leader requires faster decision making and tighter execution than in the past.\n\nThe specific exposure to AI accelerators and software centric AI platforms through SambaNova is not fully captured in a general AI and foundry narrative, so investors may want to factor in how this partnership could change Intel’s mix of revenue and R&D priorities over time.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Intel to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ Intel already faces execution challenges in manufacturing and product rollouts, so adding another AI partnership and a new GPU leader could stretch management focus and prolong the time it takes for these efforts to show up in results.\n\n⚠️ Competition from Nvidia, AMD and specialized AI chip players means that even with SambaNova and a high profile GPU architect, Intel still has to convince hyperscalers that its AI stack is differentiated enough to win design slots.\n\n🎁 If Intel can integrate SambaNova’s AI hardware and software know-how with its CPU and foundry offerings, it could offer more complete solutions for cloud and enterprise buyers looking to standardize on fewer suppliers.\n\n🎁 Analysts have highlighted both risks and rewards for Intel, and this AI focused move relates directly to the potential reward that comes from better aligning Intel’s products with the long term growth in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nFrom here, you may want to track whether Intel and SambaNova announce concrete co-developed products, reference customers or design wins with large cloud providers and enterprises. Progress updates from Intel on how Demers is shaping its GPU roadmap, and how those GPUs are positioned against Nvidia and AMD in AI training and inference, will also matter. On the financial side, watch for any management commentary on how AI accelerators, GPUs and related software contribute to the data center segment, and whether these investments change Intel’s capital allocation priorities.

It maintained a Neutral rating. Mizuho predicted that global handset shipments will drop 4% year over year in 2026, with additional declines anticipated in the second half. This is due to memory constraints and pricing pressures. The downgrade came after an industry call on handsets.\n\nOn February 5, 2026, Reuters reported that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) expected second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, both lower than LSEG projections. The firm attributed a global memory chip shortage to impacting smartphone users. After-hours trading saw a 9% decline in shares, which have now dropped more than 13% this year as of February 5, 2026. According to CEO Cristiano Amon, memory limits were the only reason for the projection failure.

Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\n\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\n\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\n\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\n\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\n\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\n\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\n\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nQualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\n\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\n\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\n\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\n\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\n\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\n\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\n\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\n\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\n\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\n\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nMicron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\n\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\n\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\n\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\n\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\n\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\n\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\n\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\n\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\n\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Investors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\n\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\n\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\n\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "The flash-crash rally hit a speed bump on Tuesday after the disappointing December retail sales report.\n\nToday’s January non-farm payrolls report and Friday’s consumer price index numbers could move the markets.\n\nWith earnings for the fourth quarter all but over, economic data could play a bigger role the rest of the month.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nFutures are trading higher after a stellar and surprising January jobs report as we get to the middle of the trading week. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a winning day, closing up 0.20% at 50,188, the disappointment over the December retail sales report hung over the market like a sword of Damocles all day. With today's January non-farm payrolls report and the January consumer price index expected on Friday, economic data could drive markets. The S&P 500 closed Tuesday at 6,941, down 0.33%, while the Nasdaq closed at 23,021, lower by 0.59%. The Russell 2000 declined 0.24% to 2,682.\n\nYields were down again across the Treasury curve, and some traders attributed the buying to forthcoming economic data and the fact that two new voters for the Federal Reserve both stated that the Federal funds rate could remain where it is for some time, as they saw potential for inflation to reignite. The 30-year bond closed at 4.79%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.14%.\n\nPrices were modestly lower across the energy complex, with some attributing the move to profit-taking. Concern over a U.S.-Iranian confrontation remains central, and oil prices could spike if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. Ships were advised earlier this week to avoid Iranian waters, so the threat remains. Brent Crude closed down 0.11% at $68.93, while West Texas Intermediate finished Tuesday at $64.10, down 0.40%. Natural gas ended the day at $3.12, down 0.54%.\n\nGold was lower on Tuesday, as the same issues that weighed on the broader market also affected bullion. One positive noted by traders was that gold held above the $5,000 level, closing at $5,023, down 0.65%. Silver closed at $80.63, down 3.20%\n\nThe cryptocurrency market was range-bound and generally traded lower on Tuesday, as major tokens struggled to sustain recent gains and investors adopted a cautious stance ahead of critical U.S. economic data today and later this week. The crypto market remains pressured by ongoing liquidation-driven selling and a lack of fresh capital to drive prices higher, as evidenced by negative funding rates. Leveraged holders will likely be forced to refinance their holdings. At 8 AM EST, Bitcoin was trading at $67,201, while Ethereum was quoted at $1,957.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.\n\nHere are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, February 11, 2026.\n\nBETA Technologies Inc. (NYSE: BETA ) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Jefferies with a $30 target price.\n\nCloudflare Inc. ( NYSE: NET ) was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Baird, which raised the target price for the stock to $260 from $230.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods Inc. ( NYSE: DKS ) was raised to Outperform from Neutral at Baird, and the price target for the retail giant was raised to $253 from $230.\n\nMonro Inc. (NASDAQ: MNRO) was upgraded to Outperform from Perform at Oppenheimer with a $40 target price.\n\nTyler Technologies Inc. (NYSE: TYL ) was raised to Buy from Neutral at DA Davidson, which actually lowered the target price for the company to $460 from $510.\n\nBP Plc. (NYSE: BP) was downgraded to Sell from Buy at Melius Research with a $31 target price.\n\nMattel Inc. (NYSE: MAT ) was downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JPMorgan, which trimmed the target price for the toy giant to $14 from $23.\n\nNoble Corp. plc ( NYSE: NE ) was cut to Hold from Buy at Fearnley with a $38 target price.\n\nQualcomm Inc. ( NASDAQ: QCOM ) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Daiwa, which has a $140 target for the legacy tech giant.\n\nXPO Inc. ( NYSE: XPO ) was cut Neutral from Positive at Susquehanna with a $210 target price.\n\nBridge Bio Oncology Therapeutics, Inc. ( NASDAQ: BBOT) was started with a Buy rating at Stifel, which has a $23 target for the stock.\n\nEnergy Fuels Inc. ( NYSE: UUUU ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Goldman Sachs, with a $30 target price.\n\nJefferson Capital Inc. ( NASDAQ: JCAP ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Texas Capital with a $28 target price.\n\nSamsara Inc. ( NYSE: IOT ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Goldman Sachs, which has set a $36 target price objective.\n\nVelo3D Inc. ( NASDAQ: VELO ) was started with a Buy rating at Lucid Capital, with a $25 target price.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

Davidson調升投資評級至買進之外，OpenAI執行長奧特曼（Sam Altman）的發言也帶來提振。Lerner表示，這是一個嚴重超賣的市場，只要有一點點利多消息就能帶來顯著的效果。在上周的拋售中，科技股和軟體股的「橡皮筋被拉伸得太長了」。\n\nCNBC報導，OpenAI執行長奧特曼上周五向員工和投資人表示，ChatGPT的月成長率已重返逾10%。他並透露本周將推出升級版的AI聊天機器人模型。此外，D.A.

Davidson分析師Gil Luria出具報告指出，我們認為市場過度反應，股價已經跌過頭。近幾個月來，OpenAI的商業模式已有顯著進步，「OpenAI似乎已經修正策略失誤，並重新聚焦於核心的前沿模型（frontier models），也開始考慮安插廣告的「變現」模式，「我們認為重整後的OpenAI可望重返Google最大挑戰者的位置」。CNBC報導，OpenAI執行長奧特曼（Sam Altman）上周五告知員工和投資人，ChatGPT的月成長率已重返逾10%。他並透露本周將推出升級版的AI聊天機器人模型。\n\n●Alphabet漲0.45%，收在324.32美元。據外媒報導，Google母公司Alphabet周一成功發行公司債籌資200億美元，規模超出原訂的150億美元。Alphabet此次發債吸引超過1000億美元認購，成為史上企業債發行需求最強勁的交易之一，顯示對於科技巨頭舉債發展AI，市場目前仍然樂意買單。分析師表示，這可能帶動今年企業債發行規模創下歷史新高。\n\n●Waters Corp周一崩跌13.94%，收在328.14美元，在醫療保健成分股中跌幅最大。該實驗室設備製造商第一季獲利預測不如市場預期，此外，投資人也關注去年收購的Becton Dickinson表現疲弱。\n●Hims & Hers Health暴跌16%，為連跌第七天。諾和諾德（Novo Nordisk）以侵犯專利權為由向這家遠距醫療（telehealth）公司提起告訴。此前，在美國食藥管理局（FDA）強烈反對下，Hims & Hers Health在推出僅48小時後後又立即下架一款售價僅49美元的諾和諾德減肥藥Wegovy仿製藥。\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.
