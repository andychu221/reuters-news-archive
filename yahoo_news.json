Mehta, who has said he is a full time student, was fired from his job at the Ector County Library last year and is suing the County alleging he was fired because he filed a public records request and because he alleged illegal hiring practices. He also claims racial and national origin discrimination and ‘inadequate training exists within Ector County as it relates to persons of color,” the lawsuit stated.",

Next we will unpack what that means using different valuation methods, before finishing with a way to look beyond the numbers for an even clearer view of value.",

【時報-台北電】台股進入農曆春節封關期，海外複委託交易不打烊，元大、國泰、永豐金、富邦等證券等皆祭出春節期間美股交易優惠活動，吸引投資人搶賺紅包財。 過年期間海外交易火熱，據統計，去年元月雖放了7天春節連假，但當月複委託交易量與當年月均量近乎相當，表現毫不遜色，顯示複委託交易不打烊，吸引國內投資人交易。 元大證券表示，觀察主要客戶在投資海外市場時，仍以相對熟悉的美國市場為核心。以股權市場為例，前三大交易市場依序為美國、日本與香港；其中，美股交易比重占整體市場近9成，是最重要的海外投資市場。值得注意的是，日本市場的重要性與日俱增，目前已成為台灣人投資海外股市的第二大選擇。

200指數則開高走揚。不過，半導體權值股表現疲弱，成為韓股盤面壓力來源，顯示人工智慧（AI）題材雖仍具中長期動能，短線資金轉趨保守。根據盤中數據，南韓KOSPI指數報5301.72點，幾乎持平；KOSDAQ指數上漲0.39%，報1119.52點，創業板買盤相對積極。澳洲S&P/ASX

【時報記者張佳琪台北報導】半導體、AI科技等類股強勢帶動美股行情，國人參與海外市場投資的熱度也持續升溫。為降低跨國投資門檻並提升小額交易彈性，玉山證券今（9）日宣布，取消美股複委託最低手續費門檻，1元也能參與美股交易，打破「交易金額過小不划算」的限制。玉山證券指出，投資人無論資金規模大小，將可更加靈活分批進場或者依盤勢調整部位，提升資金運用效率與投資自主性。 2025年美股在多重題材推動下強勢創高，推升國內投資人美股成交金額逼近新台幣8兆元、年增37%，開戶數亦增至700萬戶，已成為國人進行全球資產配置的重要管道。玉山證券指出，除了長期定期定額，已有許多投資人選擇主動掌握市場節奏，積極參與AI概念股，包括下半年漲勢強勁的記憶體產業，例如：Micron(MU)、Sandisk(SNDK)、Western Digital(WD)等，以及受惠美國政策推動的電力電網、核能、無人機等族群。 展望2026年，AI基礎建設持續推進，相關科技與政策受惠族群維持強勁動能，一般預料美股熱度可望延續。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）1月的報告已將美國2026年GDP成長率調升至2.4%。另，高盛與FactSet則\n時報資訊 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n《金融》永豐金證春節海外投資不打烊 新科Fed主席將鴿派至期中選舉 【時報記者張佳琪台北報導】台股封關，進入春節假期。永豐金證券宣布，春節假期複委託網路交易及人工接單24小時服務不打烊，大戶投APP、新理財網等平台均持續提供複委託下單，豐存股-美股年假期間亦維持正常扣款投資，要讓海外投資用戶春節理財無假期。 回顧2025年，國人對複委託投資的開戶數與投資金額皆火熱。全市場數據顯示，全年複委託新增戶數112萬戶、總戶數達701萬戶；總成交金額年增37%，達新台幣10.8兆元；美股定期定額交易戶數全年更年增88%，定期定股年成長28%，整體總成交金額成長45%。永豐金證券表示，去年在零售市場展現穩健成長動能，2025年零售複委託成交金額年增22%，市佔17.4%，於競爭激烈的市場中維持前段班表現。 投資人關注春節後的美股表現，尤其聚焦美國聯準會被提名新任主席華許政策方向。國際市場提前反應他過往偏鷹派的政策思維，1月白銀帶頭走跌，恐慌氣氛遍布貴金屬，並蔓延到比特幣及股市等風險性資產。永豐金證券預期，5月前華許可望表態「自己是有節制(不QE願降息)的鴿派」，上任後甚至可能將啟動數次降息表態；若美股自5月起一路走揚至年底，華許將可能在期中選舉結束後露出「鷹爪」，\n時報資訊 ・ 2 天前 ・

（中央社記者潘智義台北2026年2月10日電）友達光電(2409)董事長彭(雙)浪今天表示，智慧移動、垂直場域兩事業2025年第4季占營收約46%，盼2030年超過70%。友達今天舉行法說會，彭(雙)浪指出，展望2026年審慎樂觀，雖仍有關稅議題、地緣政治及區域衝突，但顯示器、垂直場域、智慧移動3大業務都有機會成長，尤其併購德國一級汽車零件供應商BHTC後，不只帶動智慧移動事業，垂直場域事業也跟著受惠。彭(雙)浪說明，2025年上熱下冷，下半年不如預期，中國內捲、美國推對等關稅、新台幣升值等因素都有影響，去年第4季本業不佳，但靠業外出售廠房獲利挹注，全年順利轉虧為盈。友達統計，2025年全年歸屬於母公司業主淨利新台幣68.4億元，基本每股盈餘0.90元；友達今天董事會通過盈餘分配案，現金股利每股0.4元。友達去年11月14日公告處分於新竹科學園區力行路23號L3C廠房及其相關廠務附屬設施，交易總金額68.98億元。關於新一代面板顯示技術，彭(雙)浪說，微型發光二極體（Micro

展望2026年首季，台積電預期合併營收將介於346～358億美元，季增2.58～6.13％、年增35.55～40.25％。在假設新台幣兌美元平均匯率31.6元狀況下，毛利率預期介於63～65％、營益率介於54～56％。 以此推算，台積電首季合併營收估落於1.09～1.13兆元，季增4.52～8.14％、年增30.28～34.8％，中位數1.11兆元，季增6.33％、年增32.54％，連4季改寫新高。毛利率及營益率預估中\n時報資訊 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n中華電信ADR13日下跌0.07美元跌幅0.16%折台股134.64元 (中央社台北2026年 2月14日電)中華電信在NYSE掛牌ADR 以

ServiceNow's stock, which Tengler's firm owns, has plunged roughly 30% year-to-date, \"and it was down 27% last year,\" she notes, calling the drop \"one of the most befuddling sell-offs that I've seen in my career.\" \"ServiceNow is the conductor of AI on the cloud and is vertically integrating to agentic security,\" Tengler said. \"And many other areas of the vertical integration are important and I think are a moat for the company. But the market doesn't agree with me.\" Speaking with Reuters' Lisa Bernhard, Tengler also described why her firm recently bought more shares of Microsoft, Palantir and Apple, among other tech stocks. And, she addressed the Friday release of the Consumer Price Index for January, noting how the cost of services \"has been a problem all the way through this inflationary regime.\"",

【財訊快報／陳孟朔】全球晶圓代工龍頭台積電(2330)(美股代碼TSM)ADR漲勢凌厲，繼連續兩天大漲23.11美元或7.1%後，週一(9日)再度追高6.56美元或1.88%，終場收在355.41美元，連三紅且連續兩天破頂。台積電ADR自2026年開春以來已累計大漲16.95%，不僅展現強勁的上攻力道，更成功超越同期費城半導體指數(SOX)15.24%的漲幅。受惠於AI晶片需求持續爆發以及先進製程產能滿載，台積電股價頻頻破頂，帶動市值持續膨脹。截至週一收盤，台積電總市值已攀升至1兆8433億美元，穩居全球第七大科企。以週一收盤價355.41美元及新台幣匯率31.56元計算，台積電ADR折合台股每股價格約為2243.35元，較台股週一收盤價1815新台幣存在高度溢價。分析人士指出，台積電近期調升2026年資本支出預期至520億至560億美元，顯示公司對未來兩年由AI驅動的成長前景極具信心。隨著3奈米產能擴張與2奈米量產進度順利，法人預期台積電2026年營收有望挑戰30%的高速成長。相較於其他半導體同業，台積電在技術領先與獲利能力上的優勢，使其成為資金在半導體族群中的首選目標。\n財訊快報

【財訊快報／陳孟朔】全球晶圓代工龍頭台積電(2330)(美股代碼TSM)ADR漲勢凌厲，繼連續兩天大漲23.11美元或7.1%後，週一(9日)再度追高6.56美元或1.88%，終場收在355.41美元，連三紅且連續兩天破頂。台積電ADR自2026年開春以來已累計大漲16.95%，不僅展現強勁的上攻力道，更成功超越同期費城半導體指數(SOX)15.24%的漲幅。受惠於AI晶片需求持續爆發以及先進製程產能滿載，台積電股價頻頻破頂，帶動市值持續膨脹。截至週一收盤，台積電總市值已攀升至1兆8433億美元，穩居全球第七大科企。以週一收盤價355.41美元及新台幣匯率31.56元計算，台積電ADR折合台股每股價格約為2243.35元，較台股週一收盤價1815新台幣存在高度溢價。分析人士指出，台積電近期調升2026年資本支出預期至520億至560億美元，顯示公司對未來兩年由AI驅動的成長前景極具信心。隨著3奈米產能擴張與2奈米量產進度順利，法人預期台積電2026年營收有望挑戰30%的高速成長。相較於其他半導體同業，台積電在技術領先與獲利能力上的優勢，使其成為資金在半導體族群中的首選目標。\n財訊快報

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2026-poised-even-bigger-gains-204600445.html",
      "Content": "Stocks are off to a mostly good, but uneven start this year.\n\nYTD, the Dow is up 2.99%; the S&P is off -0.14%; the Nasdaq is down -2.99%, the small-cap Russell 2000 is up 6.64%; and the mid-cap S&P 400 is up 7.82%.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq, which led the indexes last year with a 20.4% gain, and the S&P 500, which was up 16.4%, have lagged this year as concerns over AI Capital Expenditures have weighed on tech stocks.\n\nStocks like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others have seen sharp drops this year. And the headlines point to increased CapEx as the culprit, with people wondering if those investments will ever pay off.\n\nIronically, many of those very same companies continue to show double-digit top and bottom line growth, and cite increasing AI demand for driving their buildout. So, there&rsquo;s a bit of cognitive dissonance there.\n\nBut the idea that the AI boom is over, and that companies investing heavily in AI will never see a return, couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth, in my opinion.\n\nFirst, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that we are still in the relatively early stages of the transformational AI boom.\n\nI mean, ChatGPT was only released in November of 2022. And that sparked the AI boom.\n\nAnd I believe it has years more to go.\n\nTo be sure, it will enter different phases along the way. Companies like NVIDIA, for example, are selling AI infrastructure (chips, servers, AI training systems, and more). Those are the ones seeing the biggest benefit right now.\n\nOthers have to buy these products to build their AI models and tools. Those are the ones seeing the most cost.\n\nThen those tools are sold to others to build their products, or used internally to build their own products.\n\nPoint is, we are in the infrastructure phase right now and it&rsquo;s accelerating.\n\nThe tools and models phase is in the early innings.\n\nAnd the application and productivity phase has really just begun. And that&rsquo;s where the real broader economic payoff happens.\n\nBut the winners will multiply as the cycle moves thru its stages.\n\nSo, I would chalk up the recent volatility in AI names as nothing more than some long overdue profit taking after heady gains.\n\nRemember, last year&rsquo;s stellar performance in the S&P, for example, marked the third year in a row of double-digit gains.\n\nAnd I&rsquo;m expecting this year to be the fourth.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing AI boom, there&rsquo;s a myriad of reasons why, including tamer inflation reports, the resiliency of the economy and lower interest rates, to name a few.\n\nFor those who wished they would have taken better advantage of last year&rsquo;s rally, the good news is that this year could be even more spectacular.\n\nAnd that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m expecting.\n\nHistory Repeats Itself\n\nLast year saw the S&P 500 gain 16.4%. That was on top of 2024&rsquo;s 23.3%, and 2023&rsquo;s 24.2%.\n\nThe historic tech boom, led by AI, played a large part in sending stocks soaring.\n\nIt reminds me of the tech boom in 1995-1999 when the market surged by double-digits each year for 5 long, glorious years in a row, resulting in a 220% increase for the S&P, while plenty of individual stocks were up several hundred percent to several thousand percent.\n\nAnd I believe we could possibly see the same thing again now. Maybe 5 years, or more, of boom times &ndash; for similar reasons, and some unique to the present day.\n\nTech Booms: Past And Present (Dot-Com To AI)\n\nThe tech boom back then saw everybody go nuts for technology stocks, driven by the internet and dot-com companies.\n\nIt was new and exciting. And the internet was forecast to change the way people shopped, did business, and interacted with each other.\n\nThe promise was real, as we now know.\n\nToday&rsquo;s technology boom is being driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAnd it&rsquo;s forecast to be just as transformative as the personal computer, the internet and the mobile phone. And it&rsquo;s expected to touch virtually every industry in some way shape or form, as well as impact ordinary lives.\n\nThe AI trade has worked so well for a reason -- because the AI boom is real, and is supported by real earnings, and real growth potential.\n\nBut there are plenty of other catalysts that make the market outlook even more exciting.\n\nContinued . . .\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday Deadline: Claim your Free Copy of Finding #1 Stocks\n\nOne single idea changed Kevin Matras&rsquo; life as an investor, allowing him to tap into the greatest force driving stock prices.

Opportunity ends at midnight tonight.\n\nGet your free book now >>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe AI Trade Is Alive And Well\n\nYes, I know, there are some who think AI is in a bubble.\n\nDon&rsquo;t believe it.\n\nThe AI trade is alive and well. And will likely be one of the key drivers for stocks for years to come.\n\nA recent comment underscoring the AI trade came from AMD CEO Lisa Su, who characterized the demand for AI as &ldquo;insatiable,&rdquo; and said her company alone could grow by 35% a year for the next 3-5 years because of that. In fact, she said the AI market is \"faster than anything we've seen before.&rdquo; And she predicted the AI data center market could grow to &ldquo;$1 trillion&rdquo; by 2030.\n\nA resounding outlook for the scale of AI.\n\nHere&rsquo;s a few more, by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang:\n\n&ldquo;AI is the most powerful technology force of our time.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;AI will revolutionize every industry, from healthcare to transportation.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;We are at the beginning of a new computing era.&rdquo;\n\nYes, AI stocks have moved a lot. Some are at high valuations. But again, we are still relatively early in the AI revolution.\n\nThe amount of investment in AI will dwarf that of the dot-com era. In fact, it already has. And the unprecedented spending and innovation is expected to last for years to come.\n\nWhile it transforms the world as we know it, it also has the potential to transform one&rsquo;s portfolio.\n\nInflation And Interest Rates\n\nWhile inflation is still too high, it&rsquo;s been more moderate than the Fed had been worrying about.\n\nThe last Consumer Price Index (CPI, retail inflation) report showed core inflation (ex-food & energy) at 2.5% y/y, down from 3.3% earlier last year.\n\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI, wholesale inflation), is at 3.0% y/y, up from last month&rsquo;s 2.6%, but still down from last year&rsquo;s high of 3.7%.\n\nAnd the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index (the Fed&rsquo;s preferred inflation gauge), came in at 2.8%, down from the previous month&rsquo;s 2.9%, and below last year&rsquo;s high of 3.0%.\n\nThe easing of inflation, in part, gave the Fed the green light to cut interest rates 3 times last year. And they&rsquo;ve maintained their outlook for another rate cut this year.\n\nAs interest rates continue to fall, you can be sure plenty of money tied up in money markets will find their way back into equities, further supporting stock prices.\n\nThe Earnings Outlook Is For Growth\n\nLet&rsquo;s also not forget that earnings are the main driver of stock prices.\n\nIronically, while everyone was fretting over tariffs last year, the earnings picture never wavered and continues to point to growth.\n\nQ3&rsquo;25 earnings season put in another better-than-expected showing.\n\nQ4 earnings season (which is underway), is already outperforming expectations, and is forecasting EPS growth of 12.9%.\n\nQ1&rsquo;26 is forecast at 10.8%.\n\nQ2&rsquo;26 is forecast at 14.1%.\n\nQ3&rsquo;26 is forecast at 11.0%.\n\nAnd Q4&rsquo;26 is forecast at 13.1%.\n\nWow!\n\nAnd again, earnings are the key driver of stock prices.\n\nSmall-Caps Are Also On The Rise\n\nThe bull market rally, now in its fourth year, is broadening.\n\nTech is still a big driver. And will be for years to come. But other industries are breaking out as well. And categories.\n\nThat includes small-caps.\n\nWhile small-caps lagged the S&P in the first half of the year last year, they outperformed in the second half. And small-caps, along with mid-caps, are leading the indexes in 2026, so far.\n\nLast year&rsquo;s rate cuts definitely helped. And will continue to do so.\n\nWhile it&rsquo;s true that all-sized borrowers should see relief with lower interest rates, since small-caps tend to have a larger proportion of debt than their larger counterparts, and often borrow at less favorable terms, the rate cuts should have a sizable impact on small-caps.\n\nAdditionally, the budget bill that passed last summer, which included additional tax provisions for corporate America, not the least of which is the 100% immediate expensing of capital expenditures, will also have a positive impact.\n\nEspecially since small-caps are typically in the earlier part of their growth cycle. Those tax provisions should allow them to spend/invest more money, accelerate their growth plans, and get the entire tax benefit in year one.\n\nI think we&rsquo;re on the cusp of a small-cap renaissance.\n\nBut note: that expensing, which should have a sizeable impact on smaller-cap companies, also benefits large-cap companies too &ndash; like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon mentioned at the top, that have invested significant amounts in their AI and data center buildouts. And they too will get the immediate tax benefit of that, without having to wait 5, 7, 15, and in some cases 39 years.\n\nAnd that too will help fuel the ongoing AI boom.\n\nDo What Works\n\nSo, how do you fully take advantage of the market right now?\n\nBy implementing tried and true methods that work to find the best stocks.\n\nFor example, did you know that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy have beaten the market in 29 of the last 38 years (a 76% win ratio) with an average annual return of nearly 24% per year? That's more than 2 x the S&P, including 4 bear markets and 4 recessions. And consistently beating the market year after year can add up to a lot more than just two times the returns.\n\nIt also killed in 1995 with a 52.6% gain; 1996 with 40.9%; 1997 with 43.9%; 1998 with 19.5%; and 1999 with 45.9%. It was also up in 2000 by 14.3% while the S&P was down.\n\nDid you also know that stocks in the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperform those in the bottom 50% by a factor of 2 to 1? There's a reason why they say that half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. Because it's true!\n\nThose two things will give any investor a huge probability of success and put you well on your way to beating the market.\n\nBut you&rsquo;re not there yet, as those two items alone will only narrow down a field of 10,000 stocks to the top 100 or so. Way too many to trade at once.\n\nSo, the next step is to get that list down to the best 5-10 stocks that you can buy.\n\nProven Profitable Strategies\n\nPicking the best stocks is a lot easier when there&rsquo;s a proven, profitable method to do it.\n\nAnd by concentrating on what has proven to work in the past, you&rsquo;ll have a better idea as to what your probability of success will be now and in the future.\n\nOf course, this won't preclude you from ever having another losing trade. But if your stock picking strategy picks winners more often than losers, you can feel confident that your next trade will have a high probability of success.\n\nHere are a few of my favorite strategies that have regularly crushed the market year after year .\n\nNew Highs: Studies have shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs. And this strategy proves it. The alignment of positive price action and strong fundamentals creates all the necessary conditions to see these stocks soar to even greater heights. Over the last 26 years (2000 through 2025), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 39.6% vs. the S&P&rsquo;s 8.1%, which is 4.9 x the market .\n\nSmall-Cap Growth: Small-caps have historically outperformed the market time and time again. Often these are newer companies in the early part of their growth cycle, which is when they grow the fastest. This strategy combines the aggressive growth of small-caps with our special blend of growth and valuation metrics for explosive returns. Over the last 26 years (2000 through 2025), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 42.4%, beating the market by 5.2 x the returns.\n\nFiltered Zacks Rank 5: This strategy leverages the Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys, and adds two time-tested filters to narrow the list of stocks down to five high probability picks each week. Over the last 26 years (2000 through 2025), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 45.4%, which is 5.6 x the market.\n\nThe best part about these strategies (aside from the returns) is that all of the testing and hard work has already been done. There&rsquo;s no guesswork involved. Just point and click and start getting into better stocks on your very next trade.\n\nWhere To Start\n\nThere&rsquo;s a simple way to add a big performance advantage for your stock-picking success. It's called the Zacks Method for Trading: Home Study Course.\n\nWith this fun, interactive online program, you can master the Zacks Rank in your own home and at your own pace. You don&rsquo;t have to attend a single class or seminar.\n\nZacks Method for Trading covers the investment ideas I just shared and guides you to better trading step by step, plus so much more.\n\nYou'll quickly see how to get the most out of the proven system that has more than doubled the market for over three decades. Discover what kind of trader you are, how to find stocks with the highest probability of success, and how to trade them so you can consistently beat the market no matter where stock prices are headed.\n\nYou&rsquo;ll get the formulas behind our top-performing strategies suited for a variety of different trading styles.\n\nThe best of these strategies produced gains up to +98.6% in 2025 while the S&P 500 gained +17.5%.&sup1;\n\nThe course will also help you create and test your own stock-picking strategies.\n\nToday is the perfect time to get in.

然而１月的就業強勁表現，也使得市場對聯準會的政策預期，變得更為複雜，強勁的勞動力市場加上粘滯的通膨，都可能減少了降息的預期。但是降息預期卻是近期股市上漲的推力之一。 投資人現在將目光注向本週五即將公佈的1月消費者物價指數(CPI)數據，此為聯準會偏愛的通膨數據。而一個降溫的通膨數據，將提振人們的希望，認為即使經濟持續成長，物價也能維持放緩的水準。

道瓊在上周五大漲1200點和2.5%，收盤點創下新高。標普和那斯達克也都上漲約2%。顯示在上周初大跌之後，華爾街科技股出現反彈。 軟體股在上周承受巨大拋售壓力，此外AI支出的飆升也引發避險情緒。亞馬遜、谷歌、Meta和微軟總共要投資6500億美元，但目前沒有明顯的領先者。 市場也關注經濟數據的公布，由於政府停擺，原先訂於上周五公布的1月就業數據，將於本周三公布。 1月CPI數據也將在本周三公布。 這些報告將有助於形成對聯準會貨幣政策的預期，投資人也將衡量美國貨幣政策將如何從鮑爾(Jerome Powell)演進到川普總統挑選的華許(Kevin Warsh)。華許被廣泛地視為是鷹派，但他的提名只引發美元短暫的上漲。 在財報公布方面，可口可樂、麥當勞、思科、安森美半導體都將在本周公布財報。\n時報資訊 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n〈美股盤後〉財富管理股遭AI衝擊 道瓊連三日刷新高

（中央社記者趙敏雅台北2026年2月13日電）農曆新年即將到來，民眾資金需求殷切，中央銀行今天公布115年農曆春節前最後一個營業日（13日）的新台幣最高發行額為4兆2967億元，續創歷史新高。央行官員解釋，台灣經濟成長強勁，不少科技業獲利亮眼，發放年終、績效獎金，同時，民眾提領新鈔包紅包、採購年貨等需求，也推升通貨發行額。央行公布，115年農曆春節前最後一個營業日（2月13日）的新台幣最高發行額為4兆2967億元，較114年最高發行額4兆537億元，增加2430億元或5.99%，續寫歷史新高。央行官員指出，農曆春節前最後一個營業日，通常都是發行額高峰，年後資金會陸續回籠，預估在過年後兩個月內，約7成資金將回存到銀行體系。儘管台灣許多店家已接受電子支付，非現金支付日益普及，發行額仍續創新高。央行官員表示，長期來看，發行額年增幅略為趨緩，但仍持續成長，顯示民眾對現金仍有一定需求，可能出於留點現金在身上以備不時之需，或是過年包紅包，拿紙鈔比較有感等習慣。\n中央社財經

央行公布春節因應措施，為因應春節期間大量的跨行交易需求，每年金融機構均於春節假期前一日留存充足跨行清算資金，以支應春節連假期間跨行提款、轉帳交易24小時運作所需。根據央行統計，近年春節期間留存跨行清算資金逐年上升，自2022年的4,014億元持續攀高，至2025年已增至5,123億元，三年內上升逾百億元，今年預計留存金額將與去年相當。 央行表示，財金公司已於本年1月函請各金融機構，加強監控跨行清算資金使用情形。金融機構如有臨時性的緊急資金需求，可利用本行與財金公司增撥跨行清算資金機制辦理。 另財金公司亦將加強維護其金融資訊系統，以確保跨行業務正常營運。 央行指出，金管會已函請銀行公會轉知全體金融機構，加強春節期間ATM補鈔及電子銀行服務，以因應企業及民眾資金調度、提款及轉帳等金融服務需求，並落\n時報資訊 ・ 2 天前 ・

春節前夕，銀行體系流動性通常面臨多重因素擾動。一方面，居民現金需求集中釋放形成顯著的「現金漏損」。盡管電子支付普及，但節前傳統取現習慣尤其是紅包需求依然旺盛；另一方面，公開市場到期資金規模較大，本周不僅有4055億元7天逆回購到期，還有5000億元6個月買斷式逆回購到期。據市場測算，春節前資金缺口或達2.2兆元以上。此外，今年春節假期長達9天，可能延長資金在體系外滯留的時間，進一步加劇銀行超儲消耗的壓力。 在此背景下，大陸央行近日的公開市場操作，展現出前瞻布局與靈活調控特徵。為提前對沖春節長假的影響，大陸央行已於2月5日和6日連續兩日各投放3000億元14天期逆回購，直接覆蓋跨節資金需求。本周內，若14天期工具保持適度力度，疊加今日大幅加量的7天期逆\n時報資訊 ・ 2 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n日銀升息腳步近了？官員釋出關鍵訊號 《華爾街日報》(WSJ)周五 (13 日) 報導，日銀 (日本央行

Hauser提出警告稱，通膨率仍然「過高」，對利率決策委員會來說仍然是一個重大挑戰，委員會不能允許這種情況持續太久。Hauser週三在雪梨的一次對話中表示，部分價格走強反映出經濟中需求回升相對供應吃緊的潛在壓力日益增大。如果情況屬實，那麼通膨高漲的風險可能會持續，不能讓這種情況發生。澳洲央行成為全球首個今年升息的主要央行，而且上週公佈的最新預期暗示未來幾個月至少還會升息一次。央行目前預計，今年整體通膨率和核心通膨率都將超過其2-3%的目標上限。Hauser表示，澳洲通膨加劇的部分原因是央行為了實現經濟軟著陸，在後疫情時代沒有將利率提升至過高水準。其結果是，澳洲經濟比一些其他經濟體更接近平衡狀態，任何像去年底那樣的經濟活動激增都有可能推高物價。Hauser表示，我們必須尊重經濟的運行速度極限。因為一旦央行試圖讓經濟運行得「過快」，通膨就會加劇，而這是損害生產率成長的首要問題。澳洲央行下次會議將於3月中旬左右舉行，在此之前，決策者將會看到1月的就業和通膨報告，以及第四季國內生產毛額，可能表明經濟在2025年底時保持強勁成長。金融\n財訊快報

Qiao在報告中指稱，樂觀看待台灣的原因還包括，匯率走勢趨於穩定以及美台貿易協議的簽署，有助於降低出口面臨的邊際壓力。同時，主要科技企業積極推動資本支出計畫，且消費出現初步改善跡象，顯示AI相關動能正開始向更廣泛的經濟層面擴散。美國銀行這份報告還上調2026年消費者物價指數(CPI)通膨預測至1.6%，對2027年上修至2%。這份報告預期台灣央行將在2026年維持利率不變，並於2027年上半年啟動升息。估計央行暫不行動是基於通膨壓力仍偏溫和、服務業薪資成長停滯、非科技部門表現疲弱，以及房地產市場持續降溫。不過，報告指出，隨著消費逐步復甦、通膨壓力可能緩步累積，央行於2027年上半年轉向緊縮的機率正在上升。\n財訊快報

"論壇中心／綜合報導\n台股封關氣勢如虹，台積電供應鏈個股表現尤其亮眼，資深分析師蘇威元在《財經週日趴》分享選股心法，他以去年12月推薦的沛亨(6291)為例，該股從175元漲到封關日的276元，短短兩個月就大漲58%，蘇威元強調，抓住飆股關鍵在於「題材要對、財報要爆發」，並掌握四大財務指標。\n蘇威元表示，想要抓到飆股，首先要選對產業族群，像是AI、矽光子、記憶體、PCB、散熱等，都是目前的主流題材。他以去年12月初推薦的沛亨為例，該股同時具備矽光子、記憶體與無人機三大題材加持，當時股價約175元，封關日攻上漲停板來到276元，漲幅高達58%。\n\n在財務面上，蘇威元建議投資人要關注四大指標：毛利率連續成長、營收年月雙增、本益比相對不高、以及EPS連續跳升。他強調，沛亨的毛利率從2025年第一季的30.18%，一路攀升至第三季的36.46%，呈現連續三季跳升，這種趨勢通常代表股價有很高的噴出機會。月營收方面，沛亨1月營收月增9.47%、年增77.54%，年月雙增表現亮眼。\n\n在籌碼面上，蘇威元建議觀察千張大戶或600張大戶的動向，搭配外資買進平均成本，當股價站上外資成本之後，往上攻的機會就很高。蘇威元也提醒投資人，雖然技術指標有助於選股，但股市投資仍存在風險，建議投資人在過年期間可以好好做功課，深入研究個股基本面，並依據自身風險承受能力審慎評估，切勿盲目追高，才能在開紅盤後穩健獲利。\n《民視新聞網》提醒您：內容僅供參考，投資人於決策時應審慎評估風險，並就投資結果自行負責。\n原文出處：

（中央社記者蘇思云、呂晏慈台北2026年2月13日電）金控元月獲利出爐，13家上市金控1月稅後盈餘合計達新台幣747.57億元，年增29.38%；其中，國泰金1月獲利146.1億元，拿下單月獲利王，台股熱絡帶旺證券業表現，助攻元大金每股稅後盈餘（EPS）衝上業界第3名。觀察13家金控表現，金控旗下銀行、證券子公司多表現亮眼，前者受惠放款成長加上財管業務動能，後者則因外在資本市場熱絡、台股屢創新高帶動業績。不過，保險業2026年起適用國際財務報導準則第17號（IFRS 17），取消金融資產覆蓋法，加上部分金融資產重新指定到FVOCI（透過其他綜合損益按公允價值衡量），保險業過去股票部位多在FVTPL（透過損益按公允價值衡量），多數業者今年起把部分股票部位改放到FVOCI後，此部分的股票資本利得將不會進入損益表，不過仍會進入保留盈餘。國泰金1月自結稅後淨利146.1億元，年增0.83%，EPS為0.99元，居業界第一。國泰金表示，國壽單月獲利達86.5億元，子公司國泰世華銀行、國泰證券及國泰投信稅後淨利皆創下單月新高，銀行主要受惠放款動能，證券則因台股熱絡助攻，投信總資產規模穩健成長、達2\n中央社財經

      "Content": "[ FTNN新聞網 ]記者蔡曉容／綜合報導\n台股封關，投資人將時間和眼光轉向ETF。PTT 股板近期正熱烈討論野村投信發行的「野村臺灣新科技50」（00935）。該組合主打創新科技選股與高比例電子股配置，吸引投資人拿來與元大台灣50（0050）、富邦科技（0052）、凱基台灣TOP 50（009816）比較。\n原PO指出，00935以「臺灣創新科技50指數」作為追蹤標的，透過FactSet辨識創新科技產業，並以流動性、市值、研發費用占比、營益為正等條件篩選成分，最後以自由流通市值加權配置，單一持股上限30%、前五大成分股合計上限65%。最新成分股中電子產業占比高達99%，成立以來的指數報酬也位於臺灣50指數上緣。不過其0.435%的費率，相較0050的0.22%偏高，也成為討論焦點。\n\n部分投資人認為，00935的科技純度高、波動集中且成分股明確，直呼「這支很強」、「漲幅蠻常超越0050」。也有人分析其持股結構，包括大型電子權值股占比較高，因此視其為分散電子股的工具。有網友分享實際操作，表示已持有約20張，對績效頗為滿意。\n\n不過也有投資人質疑其費率偏高，策略能否長期勝出仍有疑問，有人認為不如直接買大型權值股，也有人指出0050內扣費用降至0.075%後更具吸引力。另有部分投資人偏好其他科技主題ETF，例如0052或費率更低的009816，認為長期投資仍應重視成本優勢。\n根據野村投信官網資料，00935前十大成分股為：台積電（2330）29.99%、聯發科（2454）12.44%、台達電（2308）11.79%、日月光投控（3711）5.16%、智邦（2345）3.55%、聯電（2303）3.26%、奇鋐（3017）2.33%、國巨（2327）2.17%、欣興（3017）2.33%以及致茂（2360）1.81%。\n◎《FTNN新聞網》提醒您：本資料僅供參考，投資人應獨立判斷，審慎評估並自負投資風險。\n更多FTNN新聞網報導\n過年前踢開高息ETF！國家隊倒貨00878、0056等4檔「提15億出場」 0050單週挨砍破萬張\n「這檔」ETF上週獲外資9.4萬張進貨！再買8.4萬張00919 與0050同連3買\n8兆資金瘋ETF！金蛇年10大吸金王揭曉 0052、0050、00904規模翻倍\n\n檢視留言\n\n相關內容\n金蛇年「大漲萬點」封關！0050領銜市值型ETF悍漲　近十年含息報酬率高達509% [FTNN新聞網]財經中心／綜合報導元大台灣50（0050）掀起市值型ETF投資熱潮，統計台股封關前一週強勢衝高期間，0050再展現純粹市值型優勢，績效領漲，包括勝出...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 2 小時前 ・ 發表留言\n\n封關日抱高股息ETF過年！外資砸20億瘋搶「這4檔」8.8萬張　00878年後除息年化配息率飆7% [FTNN新聞網]記者薛明峻／台北報導台股金蛇年昨（11）日封關，加權指數開高走高，終場收33605.71點改寫收盤新高，大漲532.74點，漲幅1.61%，成交量為6757.96...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 2 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n主動式ETF規模破1739億！這檔年化配息率10％　豪配0.377元「年後這天」最後上車日 [FTNN新聞網]財經中心／綜合報導投資新寵主動式台股ETF持續發熱，規模再度創高突破1700億大關，來到1739.29億元。11檔中有8檔規模也同創新高，其中規模百億以...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 3 小時前 ・ 發表留言\n\n蛇年狂賣也擋不住！「聯電、鴻海領軍十強」外資銀彈鎖定AI主線　金馬年資金方向全曝光 [FTNN新聞網]記者莊蕙如／綜合報導金蛇年台股正式封關，外資全年累計賣超高達5,158億元，帳面數字看似偏空，實際資金動向卻暗藏玄機。就在指數震盪起伏之際，...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 1 天前 ・ 1 則留言\n\n春節休11天免驚？配息王來了！主動式ETF「這檔」年化衝破10%　抱股過年最後買進日2/25 [FTNN新聞網]財經中心／綜合報導台股ETF投資持續發熱，特別是在主動式台股ETF問世後，更是受到投資人青睞。統計金蛇年總檔數來到83檔，其中包括11檔主動式台...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 2 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n近10年數據曝！封關日上漲機率8成　法人揭「抱股過年」最佳投資 [FTNN新聞網]記者陳献朋／台北報導台股金蛇年明（11）日就要封關，投資人對於是否抱股過年存有疑慮，根據群益投信統計資料顯示，大盤近10年封關日當天上漲機...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n高階ABF需求升溫！投信連買9日再砸12.2億「龍頭廠」加碼逾3千張　目標價上修至347元 [FTNN新聞網]記者黃詩雯／綜合報導台股今（10）日在台積電領軍下強勢上攻，早盤一度大漲逾600點，指數順利站上33,000點整數關卡，終場收在33,072.97點，上漲6...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n航海王承壓！運價、運量雙降「它」1月營收年減逾2成　投信狂倒逾千張結帳2.2億元 [FTNN新聞網]記者黃詩雯／綜合報導台股今（10）日早盤強勢大漲逾600點，一舉站上33,000點大關，在台積電強勢領軍下，指數穩步走高，終場收在33,072.97點，上...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n日經勁揚00951也狂噴9%！外資出脫3檔日股ETF破千張　「這檔」砍最多連3買轉賣 [FTNN新聞網]記者薛明峻／台北報導台股昨（9）日開高走高，終場收在32404.62點，大漲621.70點，漲幅1.96%，成交量為6319.52億元。根據證交所公布籌碼動向，外...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n半導體股強勢勁揚！台積電飆漲60元至1875元　矽統、盛群衝上漲停 [FTNN新聞網]記者洪宗荃／綜合報導台股今（10）日稍早以上漲35.09點，為32439.71點開高後，指數一路勁揚，最高一度上漲642.76點，至33047.38點，目前持續走強...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n5檔IC設計股1月營收亮眼飆漲停！盛群去年轉虧為盈也亮燈　宏觀卻慘跌停 [FTNN新聞網]記者洪宗荃／台北報導台股上市指數今（10）日稍早以上漲35.09點，為32439.71點開高後，指數一路勁揚，最高一度上漲642.76點，至33047.38點，目前...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n抗跌領息搶新春紅包？外資入手00878三檔高息ETF共7.2萬張　另砸27億元只買「這一檔」 [FTNN新聞網]記者薛明峻／台北報導台股今（9）日開高走高，終場收在32404.62點，大漲621.70點，漲幅1.96%，成交量為6319.52億元。根據證交所公布籌碼動向，外...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n拆股狂飆後一度暴挫52%！「昔日生技股王」目標價看至240元　王牌產品再獲法人押寶 [FTNN新聞網]記者周雅琦／綜合報導昔日股價站上千元的生技市值王康霈*（6919），去年7月底完成股票「1拆10」後，面額降至0.5元，股價一度狂飆至257.5元，累計...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 4 天前 ・ 1 則留言\n\n0050配息入帳！投資人曬「6位數股利」：可以過個好年了 [FTNN新聞網]記者蔡曉容／綜合報導元大台灣50（0050）最新一次配息每股1元，發息日就在周三（2/11）。有網友分享自己現金股利入帳12萬8,789元，開心直呼「可...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 1 天前 ・ 1 則留言\n\n台股ETF單周激增35萬人！主動式ETF包辦人氣榜前4名　0050、00923緊追在後 [FTNN新聞網]財經中心／綜合報導台股ETF投資熱度持續延燒！根據集保戶股權分散2月6日最新統計，台股ETF總檔數已達83檔。受益人數在上周大幅增加357,367人，推...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 1 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n營收爆發年增3727%！博士旺攻頂躋身27檔漲停股　這記憶體廠「4天強拉43%」噴上新天價 [FTNN新聞網]記者江佳蓉／綜合報導台股蛇年完美封關，加權指數今（11）日終場收33,605.71點，創史上最高收盤紀錄，漲532.74點或1.61%，盤後共27檔上市櫃個股...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 2 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n金蛇年狂漲42.85%「台積電噴68.72%」！旺宏、台玻齊亮燈　台股收史高33605.71點 [FTNN新聞網]記者薛明峻／台北報導台股金蛇年今（11）日封關，加權指數開高走高，終場收33605.71點再寫收盤史高，大漲532.74點，漲幅1.61%，成交量為6740.77...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 2 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n過年前踢開高息ETF！國家隊倒貨00878、0056等4檔「提15億出場」　0050單週挨砍破萬張 [FTNN新聞網]記者江佳蓉／綜合報導台股加權指數本週（2/9～2/11）收在歷史新高33605.71點，週漲1822.79點或5.74%，據玩股網統計，觀察八大公股近3日賣超上市E...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 14 小時前 ・ 發表留言\n\n光電族群漲跌參半！這檔直衝漲停、惠特卻轉綠摔了　友達轉盈「宣布配息0.4元」強噴6% [FTNN新聞網]記者江佳蓉／綜合報導台股今（11）日迎來封關日，加權指數以33,086.15點開高，最高衝上33,661.72點，再創歷史新高，截至上午11點40分，仍保持走...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 2 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n封關前站穩33K？這檔記憶體「營收大漲51％」刷39月新高　成交爆27萬張居冠 [FTNN新聞網]記者邱梓欣／綜合報導台股明日即將封關，今（10）日開高走高，以32,439.71點開出，終場大漲668.35點，以33072.97點作收，漲幅2.06％，創下新高，...\nFTNN新聞網 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高 5\n\n【房地產週報】輝達簽約落腳北士科！29年最大交屋潮來襲！新竹預售屋慘崩82.3%！七大都會區交易量年減7成\n\n你可能會喜歡\n你上車了嗎？記憶體登蛇年狂飆主力　前10猛將全曝光 FTNN新聞網\n\n上市櫃1月營收157家創高！老牌投顧押寶4檔「首選標的」　基本面超強火力全開 FTNN新聞網\n\n公股銀強化科技阻詐　今年預算增加幅度上看7成 中央社財經\n\n金管會示警了！春節期間「2類型詐騙」容易中招　常見話術、手法曝光 民視財經網\n\n九大工業公會聯合肯定台美貿易協定 強調為產業注入強心針 民視財經網\n\n純愛也要明算帳！情侶合攻房市比例增 專家 ：聯名登記恐耗首購優惠 太報\n\n專家：台星所得稅協定設3年落日　台商低稅紅利恐消失 中央社\n\n春節加油不打烊 加油站喝咖啡再出發 自由時報\n\n產險保費去年成長5.67%　綠能業務帶動工程險大增逾37% 中央社財經\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 工商時報\n\n性化圖像爭議未歇 馬斯克Grok在美市占仍逆勢攀升 鉅亨網\n\n外食族吃不消!

      "Content": "蘋果公司 (AAPL-US) 近期在確保尖端半導體方面陷入苦戰，全球最大的代工企業台積電 (TSM-US)(2330-TW) 的產能不足，正在成為 iPhone 增產的瓶頸。而蘋果也失去做為第一大客戶的特殊優勢。\n此前超過 15 年，蘋果一直是台積電「優先客戶」，享有最先進製程的首發權與議價優勢。然而，隨著人工智慧基礎設施需求的爆炸式增長，這場權力結構正發生根本性轉變。在 2025 年，輝達 (NVDA-US) 已經超越蘋果，正式成為台積電營收貢獻度最高的客戶。\n輝達崛起與產能爭奪戰 數據顯示，輝達 2026 財年的增長率高達 62%，相較之下，蘋果的產品營收增長僅為 3.6%。台積電 2025 年的營收成長幾乎完全由高效能運算 (HPC) 驅動，市場預計， 2026 年輝達將占台積電營收份額的 20%，領先蘋果的 16%。\n\n這場權力轉移不僅體現在營收數字上，更是一場物理上的「矽晶圓爭奪戰」。一顆輝達 Blackwell 或 Rubin GPU 的晶粒面積超過 800 平方公釐，而蘋果 A20 晶片僅約 100 至 120 平方公釐。這意味著，每生產一顆輝達 GPU，就會消耗相當於 6 到 8 顆 iPhone 晶片的物理空間。\n\n據報導，截至 2026 年 1 月，台積電的 2 奈米產能已達到每月 50,000 片以上晶圓。台積電計畫在 2026 年年底前，將 2 奈米的月產能進一步提升至 120,000 至 140,000 片。儘管產能持續增加，但 2 奈米的所有產能目前已處於全數售罄的狀態，客戶甚至需要支付比 3 奈米高出 50% 的溢價 (每片晶圓約 3 萬美元) 來爭奪產量。\n當台積電產能滿載時，這便成了一場零和競爭，而願意支付高額溢價的 AI 客戶顯然更具優勢。\n議價優勢喪失與前所未有的漲價壓力 媒體報導，台積電執行長魏哲家於 2025 年 8 月親自造訪蘋果加州總部，傳達了一個關鍵訊號：蘋果將面臨「多年來最大幅度的漲價」，且不再享有保證產能的特權。\n過去蘋果憑藉龐大且穩定的訂單，能換取最優惠的製造條件，但如今台積電的產能分配更像是一場拍賣會，由利潤更高、成長更快的 AI 客戶取勝。\n台積電 2025 年第四季毛利率高達 62.3%，已接近軟體公司的水準，反映出其在供不應求環境下的強大議價力。\n蘋果的戰略調整 面對產能受限與成本攀升，蘋果採取了 15 年來首次的重大策略轉向。蘋果已宣布與英特爾 (INTC-US) 達成代工合作，預計在 2027 年將入門級 M 系列晶片 (如 MacBook Air 所用) 轉往 Intel 18A 製程生產，以規避單一供應鏈風險並緩解對台積電的依賴。\n同時，雙方的競爭火線已延伸至「先進封裝」領域。隨著蘋果 M5、M6 系列晶片導入 Chiplet 模組化設計並尋求 CoWoS 封裝架構，蘋果將與輝達在台積電 AP6 與 AP7 等 3D 先進封裝產線上「正面對撞」。業界普遍認為，未來幾年半導體產業的核心戰略將進入「封裝為王」的時代。\n更多鉅亨報導\n\n檢視留言\n\n相關內容\n蘋果在中國逆轉翻身 竟是靠「愛馬仕橙」賣爆救援 蘋果 (AAPL-US) 去年第 4 季在中國營收年增 38%、衝上 260 億美元，約貢獻蘋果全球營收近 5 分之

BD+C銀級綠建築與WELL銀級健康建築認證，並以WiredScore與SmartScore雙白金為目標，提升建築在數位韌性、通訊穩定與智慧治理方面的國際水準。空間設計上，基地透過立體空橋系統銜接R17捷運站，形成完整的人行動線網絡。整體營運將由園區管理機制統籌，商業空間由專業團隊經營，確保長期管理品質與生活機能完善。\n\n該案總投資金額中，實施者投資約88.5億元，並申請都市更新容積獎勵50%，包含耐震設計及銀級以上綠建築與智慧建築標準等。\n捷運局表示，R17世運站A5公辦都更案不僅是軌道建設與都市更新結合的重要示範，更是半導體S廊帶向北延伸的關鍵節點。透過產業、交通與居住整合發展，高雄正加速從重工業城市轉型為智慧科技與低碳宜居城市，穩健布局在全球科技產業鏈中的戰略地位。\n更多中時新聞網報導\n外資趁亂入局？跳樓價僅此一次！南亞科、華邦電跌回支撐區「能不能抱過年看2／10法說」搶反彈首選這2檔低基期\n國安站辦貪汙

      "Content": "商傳媒 ｜記者陳宜靖／綜合外電報導\n全球晶圓代工龍頭台積電宣布調整日本布局策略，原定於熊本第二工廠量產6奈米製程，如今轉向更先進的3奈米技術，為日本半導體自主化與產業升級投下震撼彈。隨著人工智慧（AI）與資料中心需求飆升，日本在高階晶片供應鏈中的角色正面臨關鍵轉折。\n根據規劃，台積電位於熊本縣菊陽町的第二工廠，原本鎖定2027年啟動6奈米量產，主攻電動車與高效能運算晶片。然而近期公司高層向日本政府說明，將評估導入3奈米製程，顯示策略方向已從成熟製程升級至尖端技術。半導體線寬愈小，電晶體密度愈高，運算效能與能效比同步提升。3奈米目前廣泛應用於高階智慧型手機與伺服器晶片，是AI算力競賽的核心節點。\n\n日本過去在半導體材料與設備領域具全球領導地位，但在先進製程量產上逐漸落後。目前日本企業多集中於40奈米以上製程，若能在本土建立3奈米產線，將補強高階晶片缺口，有助於提升整體產業競爭力與經濟安全。尤其在地緣政治風險升高的背景下，分散生產基地成為各國共同課題。\n\n日本政府已規劃提供最高1.2兆日圓補貼支持台積電設廠。製程升級意味設備與研發成本增加，資金需求勢必擴大。市場觀察，政府在強化供應鏈韌性與財政負擔之間需取得平衡。支持者認為，投資尖端製程可帶動周邊材料、設備與人才培育，創造長期經濟效益；審慎者則指出，高階晶片市場競爭激烈，需求波動風險不容忽視。\nAI浪潮為此次轉向提供重要動能。資料中心對高效能晶片需求激增，3奈米製程成為全球科技企業布局焦點。台積電過去僅在台灣量產最先進技術，如2奈米已於台灣率先啟動試產。若日本成功導入3奈米，象徵技術外溢與國際合作進入新階段，也顯示企業在全球多點布局的策略深化。\n另一方面，日本本土晶片計畫亦同步推進。由政府力挺的Rapidus預計於2027年在北海道千歲市量產2奈米製程，目標打造國產尖端晶片品牌。市場期待台積電與Rapidus形成互補格局，一方面由國際龍頭提供成熟量產經驗，另一方面培養本土自主技術，形成雙軌並進的產業生態。\n產業鏈效應亦備受關注。日本在光阻材料、矽晶圓與半導體設備等領域具深厚實力，若先進製程落地，將強化本土供應鏈整合。熊本大學等學術機構正加速培育半導體專業人才，地方政府亦投入資源建構技術聚落。分析指出，人才與技術累積需時間發酵，短期內仍仰賴跨國合作與經驗移轉。\n綜合觀察，台積電熊本廠升級3奈米不僅是單一企業決策，更牽動日本半導體戰略轉型。從AI算力競逐、供應鏈重組到經濟安全布局，皆顯示全球半導體版圖正重新洗牌。未來能否在成本、技術與市場需求間取得最佳平衡，將決定日本在新一輪晶片競賽中的定位。\n\n檢視留言\n\n相關內容\n《產業》AI基建加速

      "Content": "「我自己投資台股、美股，長期報酬不是更高嗎？」「而且勞退要等到退休才能領，資金完全被鎖住。」這是多數上班族面對勞退自提 6% 時的第一個疑問。勞退自提 6% 到底是不是一個「一定要做」的選擇？還是其實只適合某些人？\n1. 勞退基金是什麼？自提 6% 是什麼意思？\n依《勞工退休金條例》規定，雇主每月必須為勞工提繳薪資 6%，存入個人退休專戶，由勞動部勞動基金運用局統一管理，屬於個人帳戶制，就算公司倒閉也不影響這筆資金，離職後也仍會持續累積。 在雇主提繳之外，勞工可再自願提繳 1%～6% 的薪資，這就是所謂的「勞退自提」。自提金額不計入當年度薪資所得課稅，即稅前扣除，並設有最低收益保障機制，保證比定存好， 但資金須等符合法定退休條件後才能動用，且投資標的由政府統一運作。因此，自提 6% 的本質，是一種結合稅務優惠與強制儲蓄機制的退休準備工具。\n\n2. 什麼時候可以領？怎麼領？\n\n請領退休金課稅方式\n年滿 60 歲即可請領。年資不同，能選的領法不同：提繳年資滿 15 年以上：可選月領或一次領；未滿 15 年：原則一次領。\n「一次領」與「分期領（月領）」的差別在課稅方式不同。簡單說， 一次領是用「年資」去算免稅門檻，領越多、超過門檻的部分才會被計入所得；分期領則是每年先扣一個固定免稅額，超過的部分才算所得。\n舉例來說，假設工作 30 年退休，並選擇一次領取。免稅額度 = 19.8 萬 x 30 年 = 594 萬元。只要領取的退休金總額沒超過 594 萬元，就不須繳稅；若超過則按照級距有半額課稅或全額課稅的差別。如果選擇每月請領，免稅額度是看全年的請領總額，若不超過 85.9 萬元，則免課稅，一般來說這是不容易達到的課稅門檻。若好奇以目前薪資做自提，在退休後可以領到多少金額可以到 勞動部 網站做試算。\n3. 自提 6% vs 自己投資差在哪？\n我們直接用 2004 年至 2024 年的歷史實際資料來回測。假設每月投資 6,000 元，持續 20 年，分成兩種情境比較：第一種是每月把 6,000 元全額自提進勞退帳戶；第二種是不自提，而是把每月 6,000 元扣除當年度所得稅後的實際可投資金額，定期定額分別投資於台股、美股與美國科技股。\n從結果來看，成長型市場在這 20 年間確實累積出明顯優勢。即使在 40% 高稅率下，美國科技股約 833 萬元，仍高於勞退的 361 萬元，顯示報酬率對最終成果的影響相當關鍵。不過，隨著稅率提高，差距會逐步縮小。以台股為例，5% 稅率下最終約 738 萬元，但 40% 稅率時降至 466 萬元，與勞退 361 萬元的距離明顯拉近。 原因在於稅率越高，稅後可投入的本金越少，自提「完整投入」的優勢便開始浮現。因此，成長型資產決定長期累積速度，而稅率高低則影響起跑點。當稅率達 20% 以上時，自提的節稅優勢逐漸明顯化。\n不過，必須注意股票有崩盤並賠掉本金的風險，而勞退基金依法有「保證收益機制」 ，政府承諾就算勞退基金操盤賠得亂七八糟，最後結算給你的收益，絕對不會低於銀行定存利率。換句話說，這是一筆保證不賠本的投資。\n勞退自提與扣除稅率後投入股市的累積金額相比\n4. 我適合自提 6% 嗎？\n在討論自提之前，更重要的其實是檢視自己的理財習慣。如果單純追求長期報酬最大化，不自提、將扣稅後的資金持續投入高成長股市，理論上確實可能累積出更高的金額。但這個前提包含幾個條件：你能選到合適的標的、未來市場能延續過去的成長趨勢，以及你能在市場波動甚至大幅下跌時，仍然堅持定期定額、不恐慌贖回。此外，還有一個更現實的問題：每個月薪水發下來後，這筆原本打算投資的錢，是否真的會被確實投入，而不是被日常開銷慢慢侵蝕？\n如果你是一位具備良好投資紀律 、能長期執行計畫且能承受波動的投資人， 自行投資確實更具潛在成長空間 。但 如果對自己的執行力沒有那麼有把握 ，或擔心情緒影響決策，那麼 勞退自提的價值就在於把紀律制度化 。薪資尚未入帳即完成提撥，既節稅又強制儲蓄，讓退休準備成為一個穩定、持續的過程。\n再進一步來看， 如果你的適用稅率達 20% 以上 時，自提屬於稅前扣除，節稅效果會隨稅率提高而放大，對高稅率族群而言， 自提的優勢更加明顯 ；若

勞動部勞動條件及就業平等司指出，國定假日如果是勞工的工作日，雇主需給假，勞工若同意在休假日出勤，工資則須依法加倍發給。若放假日碰上例假或休息日，雇主應於其他工作日補假，補假當日性質視同國定假日，工資同樣照給，若補假日仍出勤，工資也應加倍計算。 勞動部指出，民間企業多比照政府機關出勤模式，周一至周五為工作日、周六休息、周日例假。今年小年夜在15日為例假，若勞雇雙方協商，補假可安排在2月20日，形成春節九天連假。 若雇主需勞工於連假期間加班，2月14日、2月21日為休息日，需依《勞基法》第24條第2項規定給薪；2月16日至2月20日（含補假）為國定假日，則依《勞基法》第39條規定，加班工資須加倍支付。另外，2月15日及2月22日為例假，除天災或突發事件，雇主不得要求勞工出勤。 勞動部表示，企業營運模式及排班多元，例假或休息日不一定落在\n時報資訊 ・ 1 天前 ・

此一跨部會舉行的閉門會議，龔明鑫說，主要是預估對美汽車進口關稅最極端的模型下，對國內汽車產業整體產值影響程度，他認影響可控，但也指出此為短期評估結果。由於目前美國進口多屬於高單價車款，國產車相對平價，市場本就有區隔，預估短期衝擊相對小，至於中長期的影響，要視國際車廠產能調配後再持續觀察，而提供給美國汽車進口的低關稅，其他國家不會比照辦理。

      "Content": "這兩週市場同時遭受 AI 海嘯、利率轉向與政治黑天鵝接連衝擊。美國聯準會立場轉鷹，川普提名前理事華許接掌聯準會主席，加上英國工黨面臨執政危機，以及日本高市早苗政府在大選勝出後，形同獲得一張擴張財政與強硬外交的空白支票。同時，從比特幣到白銀都在上演高台跳水，投資人忽然想起本益比三個字。當股匯債與原物料同步劇烈波動，這波震盪到底是短期情緒，還是新一輪景氣與政策循環的序曲？\n1. 利率與聯準會市場從等降息變成別作夢\n\n鮑爾在一月會議後明確表示經濟明顯改善且就業穩健，等於把上半年降息空間先行封鎖，聯邦基金期貨也乖乖把降息預期往後延。川普拋出凱文華許作為新任聯準會主席提名人選，市場開始重新計算未來利率路徑與美元走勢。降息不再是何時開始，而是會不會比想像中更少。在這種情況下，高估值科技股首當其衝，標普五百與那斯達克連日回檔。避險情緒升高卻無處躲避，連黃金都被追繳保證金的賣壓波及，提醒投資人利率週期尚未轉向。\n\n2. AI 熱潮與科技股從萬能解答變成估值殺手\nAI 依舊是故事主角，但這回是以反派姿態上場。Anthropic 推出新工具後，市場開始認真計算如果 AI 能寫程式、審合約與處理資料，那些靠人力與訂閱服務生存的軟體公司，未來利潤如何支撐股價？結果美國軟體股單日蒸發 2,850 億美元市值。另一邊 SpaceX 收購 xAI，Meta 與甲骨文大舉投入重金建置 AI 基礎設施，說明資本支出仍在加碼，但股價卻因利率與估值承壓。簡單說 AI 長期前景亮眼，短期卻淪為回檔藉口，尤其是漲多的美股科技龍頭。\n3. 地緣政治與政策英日劇烈轉向、川習再度交鋒\n政治局勢完全沒有平息跡象。英國工黨幕僚長請辭，首相史塔默的人事與外交任命陷入風暴，執政穩定性遭質疑，英鎊與英國資產面臨折價風險。相反地日本眾議院選舉讓高市早苗大勝，市場解讀為日本將大開財政大門。擴張財政、國防支出與更鷹派的外交路線，對日股與日債殖利率都是強烈訊號。川普與習近平通話再度把焦點拉回貿易與台海，從大豆、石油到軍事溝通，全都牽動資金對台灣與中國資產的風險溢酬定價。中東方面，美伊在阿曼預備重啟核談，若有進展，能源供給風險可望緩和，但在那之前，油價仍對任何飛彈或談判破局高度敏感。\n4. 資產波動加密貨幣、高貴金屬與飆過頭的銅\n在利率高檔震盪與 AI 泡沫疑慮雙重壓力下，風險資產首先重挫。比特幣單日重挫約一成，白銀一度暴跌兩成，黃金也被拖下水，說明這一輪不是避險買盤，而是去槓桿化。同時前一波在中國投機資金推升下大漲的銅價，也被重新檢驗基本面。中國製造業 PMI 再度掉回預警區間，地方財政與信用風險消息不斷，讓中國需求復甦這個論點顯得底氣不足。相較之下，台灣因 AI 供應鏈帶動，上調成長預測。美日股也在震盪中維持中長期成長趨勢。市場開始用更苛刻但理性的眼光，選擇繼續追求成長或先保留現金。\n鉅亨投資策略\n在震盪中聚焦核心資產，避免盲目進場\n在利率延長賽與 AI 估值修正下，美股、日股與台股因經濟與產業結構具備成長動能，中長期持續看好，但短期需接受劇烈波動，特別是高本益比科技股的修正過程。大宗商品方面，貴金屬與工業金屬近期價格大起大落，既反映槓桿去化，也暴露出市場對全球需求的疑慮，配置上建議相對保守，以避險與分散投資為主，而非短線追價。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nB15112\n富蘭克林坦伯頓

富邦AI智能新趨勢多重資產型基金經理人高皓欣表示，從總體經濟觀察，全球經濟動能仍具韌性，美國2026年GDP預估成長率維持2％以上，加上貨幣政策仍處於降息循環，市場預期今年仍有降息空間，對風險性資產形成支撐。產業面來看，AI市場仍處於供不應求階段，科技巨頭持續加大資本支出，對產業與經濟具正向拉動效果。 富邦台美雙星多重資產基金經理人薛博升指出，因應市場波動上行，持股持續聚焦具有基本面支撐的科技股，產業集中在AI相關類股，記憶體、新雲端、GPU、高速傳輸、網通、AI零組件等類股。 富蘭克林華美投信認為，近期美國聯準會高層人事調查及政治干擾，使市場關注決策團隊布局與政策穩定性，預期聯準會利率將維持現狀或逐步回歸中性；美國企業基本面展現韌性，2026年獲利預估上修，資金流向也由估值調整轉向基本面驅動。\n時報資訊 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\nAI長趨勢不變 多重資產基金穩中求勝

【財訊快報／劉敏夫】外電報導指出，知名固定收益投資管理公司品浩(Pimco)全球經濟顧問Rich Clarida表示，在川普提名的聯準會主席人選華許(Kevin Warsh)領導下，聯準會將成為「華許聯準會」(Warsh FED)。Clarida認為，今年美國經濟存在上升空間。科技資本支出熱潮真實存在，並提到減稅政策及外資企業投資廠房設備等其他利多因素。Clarida指出，華許對美國經濟的看法與聯準會去年12月的立場一致。聯準會與財政部就政策目標平衡展開討論是合理的。預計聯準會將根據華許對其批評調整政策。Clarida列舉了可能調整的三大領域，分別是前瞻指引、資產負債表、信貸配置與抵押貸款相關領域。Clarida認為，貨幣政策在無前瞻指引的情況下運作是有可能的。Clarida指出，華許需與聯準會的委員會協力合作，以推動改革。\n財訊快報

Channel）節目採訪，談到外界最關注的資產負債表議題時，他認為聯準會將對此保持謹慎。他指稱，「我不預期他們會迅速轉變。他們已轉向充足準備金制度政策，這確實需要較大的資產負債表，所以我認為他們可能會靜觀其變，至少花一年的時間來決定他們想做什麼。」 聯準會去年12月開始透過技術性購買美國公債的方式增加持有的債券，以確保金融體系擁有足夠的流動性，藉此有效控制利率目標區間。 不過獲得美國總統川普提名為聯準會主席人選的華許，曾批評聯準會的資產負債表膨脹，是造成今日通膨居高不下的禍首，因此主張大幅削減目前的債券持有量，令外界推測他上任後可會縮減資產負債表。專家認為，川普總統曾表示希望大幅降低抵押貸款利率，這將與華許的縮表政策背道而馳。 貝森特在訪談中還強調，華許會是一位非常獨立的聯準會主席。\n時報資訊 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n貝森特：Fed不會激進縮表

      "Content": "台積電加速海外擴廠，引發成本上升與技術外移疑慮。前台積電技術長孫元成以22年第1線見證，拆解護國神山得以制霸全球的底氣，來自3項關鍵決策。\n作者：財訊雙週刊／陳碧珠\n2026年才剛開始，台積電接連宣布在美國亞利桑那州購地擴廠，熊本廠也將轉向3奈米先進製程；彼時，海外設廠成本高、學習曲線長，是否稀釋台灣本土技術優勢雜音再起。而英特爾在美國支持下力拚復興，競爭態勢相較過去，更多了國家力量介入。\n「去海外設廠一定得繳學費，但此刻的台積電，正是繳得起的時候。」陽明交大產學創新研究學院院長、台積電前技術長孫元成接受《財訊》專訪時直言，因為台積電正搭上AI帶動高成長，營收與獲利規模，都足以吸收新廠初期學習成本。\n\n「何況企業規模一旦放大，走向全球布局是必然趨勢，沒有地緣政治，它還是會發生。」孫元成強調，半導體產業真正的競爭風險並非成本，而是持續維持技術領先、掌握快速成長市場、獲得客戶埋單，「關於這一點，我也不擔心。」\n\n孫元成1997年加入台積電，返台前任職於著名的IBM華生研究中心，與晚他3年（2000年）加入台積電的前研發副總林本堅曾在IBM共事；而早他兩年（1995年）加入台積電的現任共同營運長米玉傑，也是來自IBM。\n對外取經 對內雙向整合\n在IBM期間，孫元成領導團隊在COMS、Bipolar與矽鍺異質雙極性電晶體（HBT）上取得技術突破；而在加入台積電後，也讓公司在COMS邏輯製程自二五微米起以近乎每年一代的速度推進，短短幾年內追上國際大廠水準。\n其後，他倡導的低耗電CMOS SoC平台，被國際技術藍圖委員會（ITRS）納入制定技術規格，開啟手機與行動運算應用；甚至在ChatGPT問世之前，他率先提出3D×3D系統架構，預見AI晶片將在半導體產業引爆新一波需求。\n孫元成說，自己加入的那1年正好是台積電成立10年，創辦人張忠謀開始全面瞄準製程技術自主，希望從追隨者轉為超車英特爾、三星。為配合此一策略，與他同一年加入時任台積電研發副總的蔣尚義，大舉擴充研發部門，一路挑戰極限。\n根據《財訊》雙週刊報導，2019年退休的孫元成，如今回顧台積電先進製程能穩居領導地位，認為有3項關鍵決策。第一是補足研發自主能量、強化國際合作。一加入台積電，他便推動公司參與Sematech、SRC等國際重要半導體研究組織，「當時在十年內還拒絕兩次大廠授權誘惑。」\n2008年，孫元成更商請多位主管前往有半導體產業大腦的比利時微電子研究中心（IMEC）駐點，參與當時全球第一台極紫外光（EUV）曝光機的研究；這也開啟了台積電與艾司摩爾（ASML）後續的深度合作。之後更在時任營運長劉德音支持下，對內成立先導研發「探路」（Pathfinding）組織；2018年二顧茅廬，成功邀請在史丹佛任教14年的黃漢森出任首席科學家。兩年後，台積電7奈米製程正式超越英特爾，站上世界第一。\n第2是台積電成功推動研發與製造整合的「One Team」模式。也是台積電董事長自信跨越海外設廠門檻的一大優勢。\n孫元成指出，早期半導體公司普遍存在研發與工廠分離問題，研發並沒有專屬生產線，「這會導致研發成果難以快速量產、良率改善緩慢」。\n據了解，台積電是從20奈米以下，開始啟動研發與生產結合的「One Team」模式，成功從三星手上搶到蘋果iPhone 6的A8處理器訂單。後來，台積電更在內部建立「知識管理」平台，如同問診有各種病史紀錄可快速查詢與參考，進而讓之後的16奈米鰭式電晶體（FinFET）、2奈米環繞式閘極（GAA）等先進製程研發，試產良率比預期佳又快。\n在台積電推動One Team的過程，孫元成分享自己也推出「design for manufacturing」概念，即要求研發在設計階段即納入製造部門，也向《財訊》雙週刊透露過程中，他頻繁與元件模擬製程部門以及品質可靠部門合作，快速地找出問題根源，加速良率爬升與量產。\n第3是台積電優秀人才的連續性累積。孫元成認為，這也是台積電最難被複製的競爭力。台積電第1次大規模的人才匯集，是在2000年前後由曾繁城主導的「群山計畫」，當時主要針對5家無力自建12吋產能的IDM客戶提供專屬服務，沒想到也吸引大量海外人才回流，並與工研院體系培養的台積電工程師融合，逐步形成「土洋人才大熔爐」。\n人才連續性累積 難被複製\n面對現在外界質疑台積電吸納過多國內人才、排擠其他產業，孫元成卻有不同看法，認為半導體是所有電子產業核心，而台積電有一套培養員工解決問題、創新跨域能力，能外溢至其他產業。但也提醒，年輕人不應只因產業「夯」或薪資高就選擇台積電，真正能走得長遠的，仍是對物理、科學工程與半導體本身的興趣，「如果沒有熱忱，半導體本身，是高壓又難搞的」。\n回顧自身投入半導體的起點，孫元成也是源於對物理的興趣。與孫元成有60年交情的蔚華創辦人陳有諒說，孫元成自國中時期就是學霸，《財訊》雙週刊指出，他個性謹慎，卻很樂意分享；加上分析事情客觀、對事不對人，應該是他能在台積電駕馭一群腦袋絕頂聰明的研發人員關鍵。\n面對近期台積電前研發副總羅唯仁轉任英特爾引發市場熱議，陳有諒則透露，孫元成一退休為避免任何利益衝突，竟主動通知同學暫不聯繫，「時間長達兩年」，展現嚴謹自律的性格。\n採訪尾聲，孫元成笑說，退休後原本想好好遊山玩水，卻碰到疫情與半導體人才荒而接下培育人才任務，但也對被他尊稱為「老闆」的夫人難交代，「時間都不夠出去玩」。不過，隨著台積電迎來退休潮，他透露一群台積電老戰友成立了「台積電榮友會」重聚，不只持續交流，也計畫投入對社會有益的行動。…（

夏普公告，決議執行今年8月K2廠停產計畫。該廠主要利基點是Oxide背板技術，也曾是蘋果MacBook以及iPad的產品技術指標。然而韓國、大陸面板廠陸續投資Oxide背板產能，因此這項技術紅利逐漸消失。 TrendForce估算，目前蘋果產品僅能支撐K2工廠16％～17％左右的稼動。今年MacBook OLED版本將問世，將進一步排擠未來蘋果高階LCD面板的訂單數量。蘋果訂單前景不明朗，是影響夏普停產決定的關鍵因素之一。 在短期內LCD Oxide仍占蘋果IT產品一定比重的情況下，一旦K2工廠產能於8月收斂，預估前兩大韓國、大陸面板供應商將直接受惠。 K2工廠蘋果以外的面板業務，受大陸面板廠產能擴張以及成本優勢的強力競爭，訂單數量減少。加上記憶體缺貨、價\n時報資訊 ・ 2 天前 ・

Logan表示，她對通膨繼續下降持樂觀態度，但只有在勞動力市場出現「實質性」疲軟的情況下，才會支持進一步降息。Logan週二在奧斯汀(Austin)的一場活動致辭中表示，接下來的幾個月，我們將了解到通膨是否正在向目標水準回落，以及勞動力市場是否保持穩定。Logan指出，一旦情況確實如此，表明目前的政策立場是合適的，無需進一步降息即可實現我們的雙重使命目標，相反的，如果看到通膨下降的同時勞動力市場進一步實質性降溫，那麼再次降息可能是合適的。Logan今年在聯邦公開市場委員會(FOMC)擁有投票權。在2025年底連續三次降息後，她支持FOMC在1月份會議上維持利率不變的決定。去年10月和12月Logan曾公開反對降息，理由是通膨依然過高且勞動力市場處於平衡狀態。週二Logan重申了上述觀點，她表示，過去六個月左右的招聘情況接近聯準會研究人員估計的「平衡率」，也就是創造就業的速度與人口成長相匹配。不過，她尚不能完全確信通膨正一路向2%回落。在接掌聯準會達拉斯分行之前，Logan曾在聯準會紐約分行管理央行的資產組合。週二她還\n財訊快報

Warsh)接替5月份任期屆滿的聯準會主席鮑威爾之後，投資者和分析師對聯準會關於資產負債表作用的講話字斟句酌。華許一直呼籲聯準會進行重大改革，包括大幅縮減資產負債表規模。米蘭表示他支持逐步縮減資產負債表的計畫，但這不可能立即實現。在到達那一步之前，監管流程中還有許多障礙要克服。這需要很長時間。我們不可能明天就開始縮減。\n財訊快報 ・ 3 天前 ・

周一，在波士頓大學Questrom商學院發表演說時，米蘭表示，我認為在一些議題上，世界已經逐漸認同我的方向。他特別提到了關稅及其對經濟的影響，並表示一年前，當川普的第二任期剛開始時，大家都擔心大幅提高進口稅會打擊美國經濟。我認為許多專家隨著時間逐漸認同了我的觀點，並認為關稅對經濟的影響「相當有限」。 米蘭也反駁經濟學界普遍存在的觀點：關稅推升物價，進而由美國民眾承擔，而非由出口國犧牲利潤來承擔。 去年底，美國總統川普曾經承認，由於他提高關稅，美國人正面臨物價上漲，雖然這項政策總體而言對美國經濟是有利的，但我認為「美國人可能得付出一些代價」。 聯準會曾表示，2026年通膨率將超過2%目標，大多是因為關稅壓力。 耶魯預算實驗室（Yale Budget Lab）上個月底出具報告指出，每戶\n時報資訊 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n美國債市突亮起經濟警訊：經濟過熱的擔憂其實是誤判？

富邦AI智能新趨勢多重資產型基金經理人高皓欣表示，從總體經濟觀察，全球經濟動能仍具韌性，美國2026年GDP預估成長率維持2％以上，加上貨幣政策仍處於降息循環，市場預期今年仍有降息空間，對風險性資產形成支撐。產業面來看，AI市場仍處於供不應求階段，科技巨頭持續加大資本支出，對產業與經濟具正向拉動效果。 富邦台美雙星多重資產基金經理人薛博升指出，因應市場波動上行，持股持續聚焦具有基本面支撐的科技股，產業集中在AI相關類股，記憶體、新雲端、GPU、高速傳輸、網通、AI零組件等類股。

Alphabet周一宣布發售價值200億美元公司債以支應AI發展，隨後又發行了英鎊債和瑞郎債。其中，英鎊公司債包括一筆極其罕見的100年期債券，是自網路泡沫化以來，科技公司首次發行此類「極長期」債券。 這波債券發行預計總共集資320億美元。 據媒體報導，市場對Alphabet這批債券反應熱絡，其中，美元債獲得超過1000億美元的認購。該美元債年期最長達40年，將於2066年到期。 Alphabet發行的瑞郎債規模改寫了羅氏集團（Roche Holding）的30億瑞郎歷史紀錄。英鎊債共發行55億英鎊，打破由National Grid在2016年創下的30億英鎊紀錄。規模達10億英鎊的百年債，刖獲得近10倍的超額認購。 為了籌集資金發展AI業務，Alphabet的長期負債到2025年已經達到465億美元\n時報資訊 ・ 3 天前 ・

【時報-台北電】Alphabet首次發行10億英鎊百年期公司債，引發市場高度關注。分析師指出，在信用利差處於歷史低檔、人工智慧（AI）長期需求仍具不確定性、科技變革持續加速的背景下，Alphabet此次發債被視為信貸市場過度樂觀與AI投資泡沫逐步累積的重要訊號，反映產業正進入高風險擴張階段。 本次百年債屬於Alphabet總規模約200億美元的多幣別融資計畫的一部分，涵蓋美元、歐元、英鎊及首次發行的瑞士法郎債券，期限分布廣泛。根據外媒報導，此次10億英鎊百年期債券吸引近10倍超額認購，票面利率較10年期英國公債高出約120個基點。 分析師指出，百年期公司債向來罕見，多由主權國家發行，企業參與比例有限，主要投資人為保險公司與退休基金，用以因應長期負債需求。Alphabet此次進軍英鎊超長天期市場，顯示其積極爭取長期機構資金，同時反映資本市場對AI題材的高度熱情，但同時亦加深外界對泡沫化風險的疑慮。 Wind Shift Capital執行長布萊恩（Bill

26.4中實裝升級版Siri，但在測試中發現Siri有時無法正確處理查詢請求，或處理時間過長，導致必須延期。 消息人士指出最有可能延後的功能，包含了透過語音操作App內部的功能，以及讓Siri能更深入取得個人資料，例如簡訊與電子郵件，在理解用戶意圖後完成更複雜的任務的功能。 以爆料蘋果裝置消息聞名的網路媒體MacRumors則指出，蘋果原本還計劃加入尚未公布的功能，例如生成圖片與網路搜尋，由於這兩項功能已在iOS 26.4測試過，可能仍會包含在3月的更新中。 目前多家外媒指出，蘋果工程師被告知使用iOS 26.5來進行更進階的內部測試，意味著升級版的Siri可能得延期至5月發布的iOS 26.5系統更新，或是9月發布的iOS 27系統更新中推出，等待時間恐超過半年。

養豬青年聯盟理事長張佑誠表示，目前國內餐廳、店家使用進口豬肉為主，其中加拿大豬肉最大宗，未來美國豬肉關稅減一半，可能價格比加拿大豬肉更便宜，殺傷力很大，確實是個隱憂，擔心國內業者更不願意選購國產豬肉。 他也指出，國人一般認為豬肉是便宜蛋白質，若與牛肉差不多價位，通常更傾向選擇吃牛肉，近年數據還顯示豬肉需求越來越少，其實美國也是有好的、無萊劑牛肉，加上0關稅，若未來美牛更便宜，國內豬肉需求又低迷，將打擊台灣原本的市場。 張佑誠表示，台灣豬長期面臨疫病困擾，除了先前的非洲豬瘟，應確實去化廚餘，尤其藍耳病、流行性下痢更需要政府極力輔導豬農穩住疫情，並提升育成率，飼養豬隻成本才可能降低，在消費市場更有競爭力。（新聞來源：中時即時 蔡佩珈）\n時報資訊 ・ 20 小時前 ・ 1 則留言\n\n《國際經濟》美國債務占GDP比重 2036年恐升至120％ 【時報-台北電】美國國會預算辦公室（CBO）11日示警，美國目前正走在一條無法持續的財政道路上，預估到2036年時，國家債務占國內生產毛額（GDP）的比重將從2025年的約99％上升至120％。 CBO報告稱，總統川普去年7月推出財政方案《大而美法案》，延長其2017年的減稅措施，並實施新的稅收優惠，預計將使國家債務在2034年前增加4.2兆美元、在2035年前增加4.7兆美元。預測美國債務總額於2036年攀升至56.15兆美元，占GDP比重達120％，明顯高於2025年的30.17兆美元與99％，預估至2030年占GDP比率便將超越1946年、因二戰債務創下的106％高點。 上述減少措施所增加的債務將超過川普提高進口關稅所帶來的收入，其提出的關稅措施，已將平均有效關稅稅率提高到13％以上，至少為20世紀40年代以來的最高水準。 另估算關稅帶來的額外收入將在未來減少3兆美元的赤字，不過前提是，截至11月20日生效的美國貿易政策在未來十年內保持不變。CBO指出，未來數個月和數年內，除美國最高法院將裁定川普徵收多項關稅是否越權外，未來政府亦可能調整政策方向。

早在去年，美製車關稅列入台美關稅談判重點之後，消費者陷入觀望，使去年車市陷入結構調整期，如今關稅確定，初估美製車有望降價一成，目前在台灣販售的美製車款並不少，包括美系特斯拉Model 3、Model Y、Model S及Model X；福特Mustang及Mustang Mach-E等。 另外，Jeep的Wrangler與Cherokee。歐系車款方面，BMW的X3、X4、X5、X6、X7與XM；賓士GLE、GLE Coupe、GLS、EQE SUV與EQS SUV；豐田TOYOTA的Highlander及Sienna；日產Nissan的Rogue及Pathfinder，以及Infiniti的QX60等24款。

【時報編譯張朝欽綜合外電報導】川普政府官員在周四與台灣簽署了一項最終的互惠貿易協定，其中確認了美國對台灣進口商品徵收15%的關稅，同時要求台灣承諾將按時程計畫取消或降低幾乎所有美國商品的關稅。 美國貿易代表辦公室在周四發表一份文件，其中還指出，台灣將2025年至2029年期間大幅增加對美國商品的購買，其中包括444億美元的液化天然氣(LNG)和原油、152億美元的民航飛機和引擎、252億美元的電網設備、發電機、海洋和鋼鐵製造設備。換言之，台灣在4年內要購買近850億美元的美國能源、飛機和機械設備。 最新的協定將台灣商品的關稅(包括台灣的半導體產業)，從川普最初徵收的20%降至15%。這使得台灣與亞洲出口競爭對手韓國和日本處於同等地位。 賴清德總統在臉書說，台灣另外也獲得2000多種出口到美國的產品免徵關稅，這意味著關稅平均稅率將降至12.33%。 而該協定仍須獲得立法院的通過。 台灣承諾的投資方面，企業將投資2500億美元，其中台積電已經承諾了1000億美元投資。美國商務部長盧特尼克(Howard Lutnick)說，台灣政府另外將擔保2500億美元的投資。 最終的文本沒有詳列投資細節\n時報資訊 ・ 22 小時前 ・ 發表留言\n\n台美敲定貿易最終協議 關稅定調15%、擴大採購美國商品 據《路透》報導，美國川普政府官員已簽署互惠貿易最終協議，確認對自台灣進口商品課徵

發佈近年美國經濟明顯呈現「K型發展」，在股市屢創高帶動下，高薪階層資產快速累積，低薪族群則受高物價與生活成本攀升衝擊，荷包難以負荷。根據紐約聯準銀行最新公布，截至2025年第四季，美國家庭負債總額已達18.8兆美元，再創歷史新高。 CNBC等外媒報導，紐約聯準銀行10日發表最新報告，截至2025年第四季，美國家庭債務總額成長至18.8兆美元，較前季增加1,910億美元，其中房貸借款占13.17兆美元，顯示房貸仍是美國家庭負債的最大來源。 值得注意的是，美國家庭背負的信用卡債務上升至 1.28兆美元，較2024年同期大增5.5%，反映高物價與關稅壓力擠壓民眾預算，部分家庭為支應日常開銷及節慶消費，藉由刷卡來維持支出，債務自然增加。 此外，第四季整體家庭借款的逾期比率升至4.8%，創2017年以來新高，原因包括關稅政策對就業市場造成外溢衝擊，影響低收入家庭的還款能力，推升家庭部門借款的信用風險。 （圖片來源：iStock）

【時報-台北電】台美今簽署對等貿易協定，美國液態乳將0關稅，酪農指出，美國液態乳進口量占比8成，若零關稅，勢必衝擊我國酪農，經營雪上加霜，期盼政府保護他們，針對進口乳進行總量管制。乳業協會則認為，要加強國產乳與進口乳區隔，原訂7月上路進口乳不得標示為鮮乳、取得鮮乳標章才可標示為鮮乳的規範，希望提早實施。 中華民國酪農協會理事長李恂潭表示，美國液態乳占我國進口量8成，若零關稅，相當於每公斤成本降價15.6元，國內廠商為了盈利，將使用更便宜的進口乳，間接影響國產乳銷量，去年國產乳銷售狀況就已不好，美國液態乳零關稅對酪農來說是雪上加霜。 他指出，酪農民國109年起就配合農業部汰弱留強政策進行減產，能經營至今日已相當不容易，沒有人願意放棄，希望政府保護他們，讓酪農永續經營，呼籲針對進口乳進行總量管制，避免國產乳產量被進口乳擠壓，並維持目前國產乳的年度產量及乳價，讓酪農能渡過難關。 中華民國乳業協會秘書長方清泉則分析，目前美國液態乳及紐西蘭液態乳占我國進口量超過5成，美國液態乳0關稅，價格將更便宜，進口量也會提升，與紐西蘭乳產生競爭。（新聞來源：中時即時 蔡佩珈）\n時報資訊 ・ 16 小時前 ・ 1 則留言\n\n美車叩關 車輛公會籲設轉型基金、進口零件同步免稅

報導指出，這項由美國商務部審批的關稅豁免，將與最近達成的美台貿易協議相結合。台積電依據這項貿易協議取得的關稅豁免配額可分配給美國大型科技公司，好讓這些客戶能免稅進口台積電的晶片。 報導稱這項關稅豁免計畫凸顯出川普政府開徵晶片關稅、促進本地製造晶片的決心，同時也給高度仰賴進口半導體、正在美國推動AI快速發展的科技公司提供緩衝空間。 受訪的美國政府官員表示，相關計劃尚未拍板，也尚未獲得川普簽署。

【財訊快報／陳孟朔】谷歌(Google)母公司Alphabet(A股代碼GOOG)週一通過發行美元債券籌集200億美元，規模遠超原定的150億美元目標。由於投資人對人工智能(AI)相關資產需求空前旺盛，此次發行吸引超過1000億美元的認購訂單，創下企業債發行史上最強勁的需求紀錄之一。Alphabet股價連續四天急跌20.83美元6.1%後，週一小彈1.46美元或0.45%，報324.32美元，開春以來漲3.62%。除了美元債外，Alphabet首度進軍瑞士與英國市場。其中最受矚目是擬發行期限高達100年的英鎊債券，這將是自1997年摩托羅拉(Motorola)以來，首家發行百年期債券的科技公司。英國市場因養老基金與保險商對超長期債券需求旺盛，成為Alphabet鎖定長線融資的首選。Alphabet上週宣布，由於斥巨資建設AI數據中心，2026年資本支出預計高達1850億美元，超過過去三年的總和。摩根士丹利(大摩)預計，包含Alphabet、亞馬遜、Meta與微軟在內的四大雲端巨頭，2026年總借款規模將激增至4000億美元，推動投資級債券發行總額達到創紀錄的2.25兆美元。市場觀察人士\n財訊快報

【財訊快報／陳孟朔】為了在人工智慧(AI)競賽中保持領先地位，Google母公司Alphabet(美股代碼GOOG)於24小時內在全球信貸市場展開大規模募資。在週一發行200億美元的美元債後，隨即轉戰英鎊與瑞郎市場，合計募集約320億美元(約新台幣1.02兆元)。此次發債規模不僅刷新多項紀錄，更推出自科技泡沫時代以來極為罕見的「100年期」英鎊債，顯示市場對科技巨頭長期信用的強烈信心。本次發債獲得各國投資者熱烈追捧，美元債部分認購金額突破1000億美元；其中最受矚目的10億英鎊「百年債」，超額認購倍數近10倍。這是自1997年摩托羅拉(Motorola)以來，科技公司首次發行如此極端期限的債券。對於通常面臨技術淘汰風險的科技業而言，發行百年債極其罕見，但受到偏好超長期債券的英國養老基金與保險商青睞，該筆債券最終定價較英國基準國債溢價120個基點。Alphabet上週宣佈將今年資本支出大幅調升至1850億美元，規模達去年的兩倍，主要用於興建AI數據中心與採購輝達(Nvidia)等高效能晶片。儘管Alphabet目前坐擁超過1250億美元的現金儲備，但在超大規模雲端服務商的貸款競賽中，Al\n財訊快報

      "Content": "Lumentum ( LITE ) delivered a stellar beat-and-raise December quarter last week that has estimates soaring.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings of $1.67 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.68%, and were up nearly 300% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nNon-GAAP revenues of $665.5 million, which beat the consensus mark by 1.85%, increased 24.7% on a sequential basis and 65.5% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe growth showcases the strength of the company&rsquo;s plans for both optical components and systems in a world where NVIDIA ( NVDA ) is building next-gen GPU rack-scale datacenter architectures based on silicon photonics connectivity, switching, and networking.\n\nProduct-wise, revenues from the Components segment contributed 66.7% to total revenues in the fiscal second quarter. The figure increased 68.3% year over year to $443.7 million. System revenues contributed 33.3% to total revenues. The figure increased 60.1% year over year to $221.8 million.\n\nLITE Q3 2026 Guidance Ignites Estimates\n\nFor Q3 fiscal 2026 (ends March), LITE expects non-GAAP revenues between $780 and $830 million vs a prior consensus closer to $700 million. The company expects non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 30% to 31%, vs expectations of 22%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings between $2.15 and $2.35 per share, vs a prior consensus under $1.60.\n\nAnd if any investor or analyst was wondering if this blistering pace was going to slow down any time soon, management said this during the conference call...\n\n&ldquo;Our forward guidance calls for over 85% year-over-year revenue growth, yet we are only at the starting line for two substantial opportunities: optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\"\n\nAnd analysts are already reflecting this optimism in Q4 FY'26 (ends June) with projected growth of 87.5% to $900 million.\n\nThe full-year 2026 sales consensus moved to $2.9 billion, representing over 76% annual growth. And FY'27 is already projected to come in near $4.7 billion, for a 61.5% advance.\n\nAs you would expect, these sales ramps, combined with improving margins, are driving the bottom line estimates higher for both this year and next.\n\nA month ago, the FY26 EPS consensus was at $5.67 and FY27 at $8.29. Today they stand at $7.63 and $14.11, representing growth of 270% and 85%, respectively.\n\nHow NVIDIA Ignited Demand for Optical Interconnect\n\nI'll admit: I was late to the optical party. And I should not have been since I follow NVIDIA so closely. Lessons learned. In December, I profiled Lumentum optical peer Coherent ( COHR ). Here's what I wrote...\n\nWe know NVIDIA is a big customer of Credo Technology ( CRDO ) AECs because CEO Jensen Huang is a big fan of copper for connecting GPUs within rack-scale architectures and Credo has repeatedly showcased its AECs in live demonstrations at the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference (GTC). These demos feature Credo's AECs connecting servers and switches directly to NVIDIA H100 GPUs to create disaggregated, rack-scale GPU clusters.\n\nBut at GTC in March [2025], Jensen announced a collaboration with a purely optical player, Coherent.\n\nOne big driver of investor enthusiasm that helped drive COHR shares from below $70 to over $190 this year was their collaboration with NVIDIA announced at GTC in March.\n\nCoherent and NVIDIA will develop silicon photonics networking switches using co-packaged optics (CPO). This ecosystem will allow AI factories to connect millions of GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA still uses copper wiring within Blackwell NVL72 rack-scale systems to connect GPUs to each other, but to \"scale out\" across the datacenter Jensen Huang recognized the power and speed of optical solutions to connect many racks together for the lowest latency.\n\nThus NVIDIA has several connectivity and networking systems that use optical and photonics solutions and they can be categorized into two main areas: Interconnect Products, including Infiniband and Ethernet protocols, and the upcoming Co-Packaged Optics, like Spectrum-X Photonics Switches.\n\nLITE and TSMC: Co-Design for the Win\n\nLumentum and Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ), aka TSMC, aka THE advanced chip foundry, are two of the most critical \"ingredient\" partners in NVIDIA's move toward Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).\n\nTheir collaboration solves a massive physics problem: as AI clusters grow to millions of GPUs, traditional copper wiring and pluggable transceivers consume too much power and generate too much heat.\n\nBy moving optics into the chip package, they reduce power consumption by roughly 3.5x and increase signal integrity significantly. Here is how they work together to build this for NVIDIA's next-gen platforms like Quantum-X and Spectrum-X.\n\nBut TSMC has to provide the \"packaging\" that allows electricity and light to live on the same chip. A major challenge with CPO is that lasers are heat-sensitive. If you put a laser directly next to a hot GPU or Switch ASIC, it will fail.\n\nTSMC&rsquo;s Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) is a 3D packaging process. It allows NVIDIA to stack the Electrical IC (the brain) directly on top of the Photonic IC (the eyes).\n\nMe and the Analysts: Won't Get Fooled Again\n\nAfter I understood this integrated circuit of interdependency, I finally bought Lumentum shares in January at $350 on the pullback from $400. Most analysts were still too timid with estimates and the high price targets were only calling for $450. Heck, Morgan Stanley thought $350 was fair!\n\nAfter earnings, LITE could only manage to kiss $500 and retreat. So I sold some of my position at $485, thinking it may have gone too far, too fast.\n\nIn retrospect, I was foolish to ever doubt the risk appetite for Lumentum (LITE) based solely on the weak reception for its stellar report that day.\n\nAnd it should have been obvious as soon as the next day when everything was falling out of bed on Feb 5 because LITE tested the silly post-earnings low at $426 and reversed higher with a big fat engulfing candle to close above $500!\n\nThen Friday, as the upgrades and delayed reactions poured in, she gaps up to $540 and closes above $550.\n\nThey almost got me again with two kisses of $600 on Monday and Wednesday this week, and then another about-face. But I'm not falling for it this time.\n\nI'm holding my shares for the full realization of what NVIDIA (NVDA) is building for the next five years, where optical components are required at multiple stages and optical providers like LITE and Coherent (COHR) can be involved at different stages of design and fabrication with CPO.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the Street herd gathering around $550 with their PTs...\n\nRosenblatt $580\nJP Morgan $565\nCiti $560\nNeedam $550\nSusquehanna $550\nB. Riley $526\nMizuho $525\nBofA $520\nStifel $480\nBarclays $475 (Equal-Weight)\nUBS $455 (from $215! and stays at Neutral)\n\nSee ya next quarter when Lumentum surprises again and they raise their PTs to $650.\n\nDisclosure: I own NVDA, TSM, CRDO, and LITE shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.",

Logan表示，她對通膨繼續下降持樂觀態度，但只有在勞動力市場出現「實質性」疲軟的情況下，才會支持進一步降息。Logan週二在奧斯汀(Austin)的一場活動致辭中表示，接下來的幾個月，我們將了解到通膨是否正在向目標水準回落，以及勞動力市場是否保持穩定。Logan指出，一旦情況確實如此，表明目前的政策立場是合適的，無需進一步降息即可實現我們的雙重使命目標，相反的，如果看到通膨下降的同時勞動力市場進一步實質性降溫，那麼再次降息可能是合適的。Logan今年在聯邦公開市場委員會(FOMC)擁有投票權。在2025年底連續三次降息後，她支持FOMC在1月份會議上維持利率不變的決定。去年10月和12月Logan曾公開反對降息，理由是通膨依然過高且勞動力市場處於平衡狀態。週二Logan重申了上述觀點，她表示，過去六個月左右的招聘情況接近聯準會研究人員估計的「平衡率」，也就是創造就業的速度與人口成長相匹配。不過，她尚不能完全確信通膨正一路向2%回落。在接掌聯準會達拉斯分行之前，Logan曾在聯準會紐約分行管理央行的資產組合。週二她還\n財訊快報

美股在周三早盤走勢震盪，但1月非農就業數據公佈，就業人數增加了13萬人，超過分析師預測，隨後股市回穩，標普、道瓊和那指收盤其實變化不大，幾乎都接近平盤。 然而１月的就業強勁表現，也使得市場對聯準會的政策預期，變得更為複雜，強勁的勞動力市場加上粘滯的通膨，都可能減少了降息的預期。但是降息預期卻是近期股市上漲的推力之一。 投資人現在將目光注向本週五即將公佈的1月消費者物價指數(CPI)數據，此為聯準會偏愛的通膨數據。而一個降溫的通膨數據，將提振人們的希望，認為即使經濟持續成長，物價也能維持放緩的水準。 在財報公佈方面，Coinbase、應材、Rivian都將在本周剩下的時間公佈財報。\n時報資訊 ・ 1 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n《美股》消息面：川普關稅大棒重擊美民眾；油金齊跌

CNBC等外媒報導，紐約聯準銀行10日發表最新報告，截至2025年第四季，美國家庭債務總額成長至18.8兆美元，較前季增加1,910億美元，其中房貸借款占13.17兆美元，顯示房貸仍是美國家庭負債的最大來源。 值得注意的是，美國家庭背負的信用卡債務上升至 1.28兆美元，較2024年同期大增5.5%，反映高物價與關稅壓力擠壓民眾預算，部分家庭為支應日常開銷及節慶消費，藉由刷卡來維持支出，債務自然增加。 此外，第四季整體家庭借款的逾期比率升至4.8%，創2017年以來新高，原因包括關稅政策對就業市場造成外溢衝擊，影響低收入家庭的還款能力，推升家庭部門借款的信用風險。 （圖片來源：iStock）

●聯準會理事米蘭表示，聯準會目前的貨幣政策，已經威脅到美國的經濟成長，同時，米蘭也再次說明進一步降息的必要性。米蘭不認為通膨是一個問題，因為住房通膨非常低，可以跟指數內其它項目更高的通膨相互平衡。因此，嘗試使用更寬鬆的貨幣政策，來支撐勞動市場是有意義的。不過，達拉斯聯邦準備銀行行長Logan卻反對進一步降息，Logan指出，自己更擔心的是頑固的高通膨，而不是勞動市場。 ●花旗表示，市場對美國通膨未來發展過於自滿，也就是說市場似乎相信通膨還會下降，但卻沒想到現在的環境，通膨的結構性反而更強，因去年實施的美國新關稅政策，可能會產生更高的通膨風險。 ●美國就業數據良好，聯準會可以在相當長的一段時間內都對利率按兵不動，BAIRD認為，如果CPI真的又開始上揚，聯準會在做出決定之前，還有幾個月的時間來觀察物價趨勢。除非新的CPI報告非常強勁，否則不會對股市和期貨市場產生真正的影響。\n時報資訊 ・ 21 小時前 ・ 發表留言\n\n《國際經濟》韓1月新增就業人數少 想躺平不工作者大增

依此數據，若按照年齡來區分，15至29歲人口的就業人數，在一月大幅減少17.5萬，故該年齡層的就業率年減1.2%，剩下43.6%。韓聯社表示，這是自2021年以來，一月的最低就業率，五年前比率為41.1%。 在中老年方面，韓國40歲與以上的就業人數也略有下降，減少3,000個工作機會。同時，60歲及以上的就業雖增加14.1萬人，但卻是從2021年一月以來最少的。 相較之下，韓國30歲和50歲的就業人數成長，依序增加10.1萬和4.5萬個工作機會。被認為是韓國經濟支柱的製造業，就業人數比去年同期減少2.3萬，連續第19個月下滑。營建業的就業人數減幅更大，約少掉2萬人，連續第21個月下降。 至於韓國經濟不活躍人口(economically\n時報資訊 ・ 2 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n《美股》消息面：美預算赤字恐破表；金銀走高

【時報-台北電】社群媒體巨頭Meta宣布，斥資100億美元在美國印第安納州興建的大型資料中心已於2月11日動工，未來將強化人工智慧（AI）運算能力，因應全球AI競賽升溫。這座資料中心位於印第安納州黎巴嫩市（Lebanon），預計於2027年底或2028年初正式啟用。 Meta表示，這座資料中心完工後將具備1GW電力容量。依據美國電網營運商資料，1GW約可供應80萬戶家庭用電，顯示該設施規模相當龐大。 Meta資料中心副總裁彼得森（Rachel Peterson）表示：「我們將在這個場址快速推進大量建設。」顯示Meta正加速布局，以取得支撐AI模型訓練與運行所需的龐大算力。 近年來，Meta與其他科技巨頭競相擴建超大型資料中心，被視為一場「世代級」AI競賽。然而，資料中心屬於高耗能設施，也引發了環保與消費者團體關切。 對此，彼得森表示，Meta已與當地公用事業公司簽署供電協議，並且強調公司將「自行負擔相關能源基礎建設升級費用」，以確保不將成本轉嫁給一般用戶。

儘管科技巨頭和美國政界都在敦促資料中心容量增加，以及增加電力生產，以保持美國AI的競爭力，但是美國民眾更加擔心，這些耗電龐大的設施，可能會影響他們的水電費，以及在該地區的土地、水和其它自然資源的使用。 Anthropic同時也表示，公司將帶來新的電力生產和電網容量，以滿足資料中心的用電需求，而不是購買(綠電)信用額度。 該公司補充說，在新發電量仍無法上線的情況下，該公司將與公用事業部門和外部專家合作，估計並抵消資料中心的電價上漲影響。 這些措施與微軟在上個月採取的措施相類似。微軟當時表示，將支付較高的公用事業電費費率，以便得以涵蓋電力成本，公司並將與當地公用事業公司合作，在資料中心需要時能擴大電力供應。 Anthropic在周三還表示，公司正在投資研究，如何減少資料中心用電量，並開發電網\n時報資訊 ・ 1 天前

CBO報告稱，總統川普去年7月推出財政方案《大而美法案》，延長其2017年的減稅措施，並實施新的稅收優惠，預計將使國家債務在2034年前增加4.2兆美元、在2035年前增加4.7兆美元。預測美國債務總額於2036年攀升至56.15兆美元，占GDP比重達120％，明顯高於2025年的30.17兆美元與99％，預估至2030年占GDP比率便將超越1946年、因二戰債務創下的106％高點。 上述減少措施所增加的債務將超過川普提高進口關稅所帶來的收入，其提出的關稅措施，已將平均有效關稅稅率提高到13％以上，至少為20世紀40年代以來的最高水準。 另估算關稅帶來的額外收入將在未來減少3兆美元的赤字，不過前提是，截至11月20日生效的美國貿易政策在未來十年內保持不變。CBO指出，未來數個月和數年內，除美國最高法院將裁定川普徵收多項關稅是否越權外，未來政府亦可能調整政策方向。

【時報編譯柳繼剛綜合外電報導】川普於美國時間八日，祝賀日本首相高市早苗領導的自民黨，在日本大選中取得壓倒性勝利(landslide victory)，同時，這位美國總統也說，自己前幾天曾公開表示，要支持高市早苗。 川普在社交媒體上發文指出，高市早苗決定提前舉行大選，不僅是大膽且是明智(bold and wise)的，希望高市以在國會絕對的多數，能順利推進保守的和平政策。 在日本自民黨贏得眾議院高達三分之二的多數席位，並創下日本戰後歷史新高後的幾個小時，川普隨即回應，熱情投票的日本人民，將永遠得到我的堅定支持。 美國財政部長貝森特在美國福斯新聞(Fox News)節目中也說，川普與高市早苗的關係很好，當日本強大時，代表美國在亞洲也強大。在八日大選前幾天，川普已表態會全力支持高市，並於三月19日在白宮歡迎這位日本第一位女首相。 日媒指出，高市千尋下個月在就任首相以來，可望首次訪美，且時間上要早於川普計畫四月訪中。幾個月以來，中國一直對高市關於潛在性的台海危機言論，抱持非常強硬的立場。 自從高市早苗在去年10月就任首相以來，川普就一直讚揚高市是日本已故首相安倍晉三的門生，事實上，川普在美國總\n時報資訊 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n《美股》消息面：盧特尼克稱美不會阻礙晶片業；比特幣跌破6.9萬美元

（中央社華盛頓2026年02月10日綜合外電報導）美國今天進一步放寬對委內瑞拉石油產業的限制。由於委內瑞拉先前已解除國有部門的管控，美方如今擴大允許美企進入當地從事石油業務。法新社報導，美國財政部發布1項許可，放行若干涉及委內瑞拉政府及委內瑞拉國營石油公司（PDVSA）的商業往來，藉此提供在委國「探勘、開發、生產石油或天然氣」所需的物資、技術與軟體。美國財政部另發布許可，授權港口及機場營運所需的特定交易；而第3份文件則開放部分與委內瑞拉產油相關的活動。美國總統川普（Donald Trump）1月3日對委內瑞拉發動致命轟炸行動、推翻馬杜洛（Nicolas Maduro）政權，隨後施壓卡拉卡斯（Caracas）當局開放油田給美國投資者進入。川普支持馬杜洛的副手羅德里格斯（DelcyRodriguez）接掌政權，條件是她必須讓華府得以進入這個擁有全球已探明石油儲量最大的國家。根據美國媒體報導，美國能源部長萊特（ChrisWright）計劃於未來某個時間點前往委內瑞拉，進行石油相關會談。自2019年起遭美國制裁的委內瑞拉，擁有全球約1/5的石油儲量，過去曾是美國主要原油供應國之一。\n中央社財經

Trump）去年夏天對進口鋼鋁課徵最高達50%的關稅，並將課稅範圍擴及許多鋼鋁製品，例如洗碗機和烤箱。不過根據3名知情人士，川普政府現正審查受鋼鋁關稅影響的產品清單，計劃給予部分品項豁免、停止擴大課稅清單，並轉而對特定商品展開更具針對性的國家安全調查。這些知情人士透露，美國商務部及美國貿易代表署（USTR）的貿易官員認為，這些關稅促使烤盤、食品罐和飲料罐等商品漲價，對消費者造成傷害。川普的關稅攻勢使美國關稅水準攀升至第二次世界大戰戰前以來最高峰，不過隨著選民對美國生活成本危機的不滿日益加劇，川普已多次撤回部分最嚴格的關稅措施。皮尤研究中心（Pew

軟體股續挫 【時報編譯柳繼剛綜合外電報導】美股三大指數周三(11日)全數走低，標普持平，那指跌幅較大，道瓊則無法連四個交易日繼續收紅。不過，費半卻大幅走高，包括NVIDIA、英特爾以及台積電ADR都上漲，美光甚至飆升10%。另外，美國一月非農就業人數新增13萬，遠高於部分經濟學者預估只增加5.5萬人。同時，失業率也從4.4%小幅降至4.3%。美國最新的勞動力報告大好之下，CME(芝商所)FedWatch Tool數據中，高達95%的機率聯準會在一個月之後不會變動利率，只剩下約5%覺得聯準會下次還會降息一碼。 美股最新收盤價，道瓊下跌66.74點或0.13%，收50,121.4點。S&P500微幅下跌0.34點，幾乎持平，收6,941.47點。NASDAQ也跌36.01點或0.16%，收23,066.47點。不過，費城半導體卻大漲184.73點或2.28%，收8,291.86點。

【財訊快報／陳孟朔】儘管英特爾(Intel，美股代碼INTC)在先進製程代工領域頻傳捷報，但週二(10日)股價仍慘遭血洗，收盤大跌3.11美元或6.19%，報47.13美元，淪為費城半導體指數表現最差的成分股。市場人士指出，雖然英特爾成功吸引聯發科(2454)與蘋果(Apple)評估其最新技術，但投資人更擔憂其產能轉換期的財測疲軟與供應短缺問題。在代工業務方面，最新消息指出聯發科有機會成為英特爾14A製程的首批重量級客戶，計畫利用該1.4奈米級工藝量產新一代「天璣(Dimensity)」行動晶片。此外，蘋果亦傳出已簽署保密協議，積極評估英特爾18A-P製程與先進封裝技術。分析師預測，若測試順利，蘋果最快將在2027年將入門級M系列晶片、2028年將非Pro版iPhone晶片部分轉交英特爾代工，這將打破台積電(2330)近十年來獨家供應蘋果先進晶片的局面。然而，亮眼的客戶名單未能挽救疲軟的短期股價。英特爾近期公布的2026第一季財測遠低於華爾街預期，財務長Zinsner表示，由於正全力從舊製程轉向18A等先進節點，加上緩衝庫存已耗盡，第一季將面臨嚴重的供應瓶頸。這種「有需求卻無貨可賣」的\n財訊快報

      "Content": "KLA Corporation KLAC shares dropped 15.1% post second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Jan. 29. The plunge can be attributed to the company’s not-so-impressive guidance, as well as operational headwinds. KLA now expects third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $3.35 billion (+/- $150 million), reflecting a modestly weak product mix on a sequential basis. The guidance also reflects the rapidly escalating cost of DRAM chips used in KLA’s image processing computers that ship with its systems, thereby hurting gross margin. Increasing lead times of its products due to supply constraints and negative tariff impact, roughly 100 bps, are headwinds in the near term.\n\nSo, what should investors do with KLA shares?

It is adding another $270 in capex to the next two years of spending to expand capacity for RF infrastructure products as demand outstrips supply. While the company is limited as to how high it can raise prices, it is deemphasizing lower margin products as it ramps new high margin ones. High margin SiPh contributed $228 million in 2025, up from $106 million in revenues in 2024, and with this additional investment, the company plans to grow capacity to greater than 5x of the actual Q4 monthly silicon photonics wafer shipments, compared to the 3x target given during the Q3 call. Over 70% of the total SiPho capacity is either presently reserved or in the process of being reserved through 2028, backed with customer prepayment.",

      "Content": "Wednesday, February 11th, 2026\n\nPre-market trading took a nice jump higher on this morning&rsquo;s long-awaited (government-delayed) non-farm payrolls report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) . That&rsquo;s because headline jobs numbers reached their highest single-month level since December 2024 to +130K &mdash; double what analysts had been expecting. The Unemployment Rate also continued to tick down: +4.3%, down 10 basis points (bps) for the second consecutive month.\n\nThat&rsquo;s a pretty neat improvement, but Wages are downright perfect: up month over month to +0.4% from +0.3% previously, but down to +3.7% year over year, which is the lowest monthly print in since February of 2021. Labor Force Participation was up slightly to 62.5%, while the U-6 read (aka &ldquo;real unemployment&rdquo;) sank to its lowest level since July to 8.0%, down 40 bps month over month.\n\nBy sector, Healthcare led the way once again, at +82K new jobs filled, followed by Social Assistance at +42K and Construction +33K. Interestingly, the biggest growth here was in non-residential construction, perhaps indicating data centers for AI are making their mark in the labor force. Meanwhile, the Federal Government shed -34K jobs last month, and Financial Services lost -22K.\n\nIdeal as much of these headline numbers are, there are a few flies in the ointment. Chief among them was a reassessment of 2025 job growth, which ended the year +584K but has since been revised to a more paltry +181K. Thus, for as nice as today&rsquo;s numbers look, keep in mind there are revisions likely, and they may be to the downside.\n\nIn all, there remain 7.4 million unemployed Americans (among those who had previously been in the workforce, so new college grads don&rsquo;t count), 1.8 million of them the long-term variety. This number increased +400K over the past year. So while the market toasts yet another metric signaling a strengthening economy, we should remain aware that the labor force is not quite as strong as it was just a couple years ago.\n\nPre-market futures are up nicely on this news: the Dow +238 points, +0.46% &mdash; riding higher after another all-time high close Tuesday &mdash; the S&P 500 +40 points, +0.57%, the Nasdaq +196, +0.78% and the small-cap Russell 2000 is currently leading all major indexes at this hour: +24 points, +0.93%.",

5.74%，強勢突破先前的整理區間。回顧整個蛇年，開春後曾受國際利空重挫，但在 AI 狂潮帶動下，自龍年 1/22 封關日 23,525.41 點算起，截至今日蛇年封關，金蛇年累計大漲 10,080 點，累計漲幅 42.85%，創下台股史上農曆年度漲幅。\n\n電子權值股扮演本日主力，台積電 (2330-TW) 上漲 45 元，漲約 2%，收 1925 元，股價突破 1900 元大關；聯發科上漲 5 元，收 1850 元；台達電 (2308-TW) 漲約 2%，鴻海 (2317-TW) 漲約 2%。傳產權值股亦加入助攻行列，台塑 (2301-TW) 漲約 2%，中鋼 (2002-TW)、台泥 (1101-TW) 均漲近 1%，大型股全面表態。\n\n隨著指數站上 33000 點，台股「千金股俱樂部」成員大幅擴增，截至封關日，股價超過千元的個股已達 33 檔，其中智邦 (2345-TW)、台達電 (2308-TW)、光聖 (6442-TW)、聯亞 (3081-TW)、群聯 (8299-TW) 搭上 AI 浪潮，分別在矽光子、記憶體、電源、交換器扮演要角。\n記憶體仍為今日領漲股，受惠產業報價看漲至 2027 年及供需吃緊利多，旺宏 (2337-TW) 強勢攻上漲停板，華邦電 (2344-TW) 漲約 4%、南亞科 (2408-TW) 漲近 3%，\n總統賴清德親上火線力挺 1.25 兆國防預算，加上地緣政治議題持續發酵，軍工全面噴出。雷虎 (8033-TW) 漲約 5%，拓凱 (4536-TW) 漲逾 4%，龍德造船 (6753-TW) 漲約 3%，邑錡 (7402-TW) 漲逾 3%，亞航 (2630-TW) 漲逾 2%。\n根據歷史數據統計，台股在農曆年後開紅盤日上漲機率高達 70%，若將時間拉長至開紅盤後一個月，上漲機率更提升至 80%，平均漲幅約 3-4%。在如此高的勝率下，今日市場買盤展現強烈信心，融資餘額並未明顯退場。\n儘管台股氣勢如虹，投資人仍需留意春節休市期間的國際變數。目前市場多空消息紛雜，多方看好 AI 資本支出持續擴大及美國經濟軟著陸，科技巨頭財報預期仍強；空方則擔憂紅海危機與中東局勢尚未緩解，恐衝擊全球供應鏈，加上聯準會 (Fed) 降息路徑仍受通膨數據牽動，若國際股市出現劇烈波動，恐將影響台股馬年開紅盤表現，建議投資人密切關注國際新聞，做好風險控管。\n更多鉅亨報導\n&bull; 〈台股開盤〉台積電蛇年甩尾飆上1905元領漲逾300點 封關日續刷歷史高\n&bull; 〈台股盤前要聞〉蛇年封關策馬狂奔3萬3、台幣闖關31.5、台積電1月營收首見4千億\n\n檢視留言\n\n相關內容\n封關日外資買超523億元創史上第八大

展望金馬年開紅盤，台新投顧副總經理黃文清認為，台股面臨11天休市，並經歷美股八個交易日，台股驚驚漲之際，存有時間風險，除了美國關鍵經濟數據牽動的美國聯準會降息時間，亦有基本面的美企財報陸續公布，尤其AI供應鏈，以及美伊談判等地緣政治，台灣也有台美協議簽訂細節等，變數仍不小。

美國勞工部將於當地時間周三發布備受關注的非農就業報告。市場預期該報告將顯示1月失業率維持在4.4%不變，以及薪資年增長放緩。經濟學家表示，川普政府的貿易和移民政策抑制了就業市場，但減稅應可提振今年的招聘力道。 通常每年1月是季節性裁員最嚴重的月份，但由於去年底零售、物流等季節性招聘減少，因此今年1月的裁員情況可能隨之減少，或許會推升就業增長。 KPMG首席經濟學家Diane Swonk表示，就業市場潛在的壓力比整體失業率所呈現的要大。薪資增長正在減速、失業後更難找到工作、應屆畢業生要找到工作也更加困難。儘管報告上的經濟數據看起來很火熱，但勞動力市場依舊寒氣逼人。 根據路透社所做的調查，受訪經濟學家預估2025年1月非農就業可能增加7萬人，超出12月份的新增5萬人。預測值在介於減少1萬人到增加13.5萬人之間。一些私人調查顯示1月可能出現就業減少的情況。

Anthropic說，公司將提高每月電費負擔，並且涵蓋因資料中心用電增加而導致電網升級所需的成本，以防止電費被轉嫁到消費者。 儘管科技巨頭和美國政界都在敦促資料中心容量增加，以及增加電力生產，以保持美國AI的競爭力，但是美國民眾更加擔心，這些耗電龐大的設施，可能會影響他們的水電費，以及在該地區的土地、水和其它自然資源的使用。 Anthropic同時也表示，公司將帶來新的電力生產和電網容量，以滿足資料中心的用電需求，而不是購買(綠電)信用額度。 該公司補充說，在新發電量仍無法上線的情況下，該公司將與公用事業部門和外部專家合作，估計並抵消資料中心的電價上漲影響。 這些措施與微軟在上個月採取的措施相類似。微軟當時表示，將支付較高的公用事業電費費率，以便得以涵蓋電力成本，公司並將與當地公用事業公司合作，在資料中心需要時能擴大電力供應。 Anthropic在周三還表示，公司正在投資研究，如何減少資料中心用電量，並開發電網\n時報資訊 ・ 1 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n亞馬遜陷2006年以來最長跌勢 資本支出疑慮籠罩 據《彭博》報導，亞馬遜

CNBC等外媒報導，紐約聯準銀行10日發表最新報告，截至2025年第四季，美國家庭債務總額成長至18.8兆美元，較前季增加1,910億美元，其中房貸借款占13.17兆美元，顯示房貸仍是美國家庭負債的最大來源。 值得注意的是，美國家庭背負的信用卡債務上升至 1.28兆美元，較2024年同期大增5.5%，反映高物價與關稅壓力擠壓民眾預算，部分家庭為支應日常開銷及節慶消費，藉由刷卡來維持支出，債務自然增加。 此外，第四季整體家庭借款的逾期比率升至4.8%，創2017年以來新高，原因包括關稅政策對就業市場造成外溢衝擊，影響低收入家庭的還款能力，推升家庭部門借款的信用風險。 （圖片來源：iStock）

鄭同時指出，「但我們可以擴展我們在美國的業務」。「我們的國際擴張，包括在美國增加投資，是基於這樣一種前提，即我們仍然牢牢地紮根於台灣，並繼續擴大國內投資」。 美國商務部長盧特尼克(Howard Lutnick)在上周二說，美政府需要將半導體帶回美國。他說：「你不可以把所有半導體製造業務都放在距離中國80英哩的地方(台灣)」，「這完全不合邏輯，所以我們需要把它帶回來」。

台美貿易協定塵埃落定 【時報編譯張朝欽綜合外電報導】川普政府官員在周四與台灣簽署了一項最終的互惠貿易協定，其中確認了美國對台灣進口商品徵收15%的關稅，同時要求台灣承諾將按時程計畫取消或降低幾乎所有美國商品的關稅。 美國貿易代表辦公室在周四發表一份文件，其中還指出，台灣將2025年至2029年期間大幅增加對美國商品的購買，其中包括444億美元的液化天然氣(LNG)和原油、152億美元的民航飛機和引擎、252億美元的電網設備、發電機、海洋和鋼鐵製造設備。換言之，台灣在4年內要購買近850億美元的美國能源、飛機和機械設備。 最新的協定將台灣商品的關稅(包括台灣的半導體產業)，從川普最初徵收的20%降至15%。這使得台灣與亞洲出口競爭對手韓國和日本處於同等地位。 賴清德總統在臉書說，台灣另外也獲得2000多種出口到美國的產品免徵關稅，這意味著關稅平均稅率將降至12.33%。 而該協定仍須獲得立法院的通過。 台灣承諾的投資方面，企業將投資2500億美元，其中台積電已經承諾了1000億美元投資。美國商務部長盧特尼克(Howard Lutnick)說，台灣政府另外將擔保2500億美元的投資。 最終的文本沒有詳列投資細節\n時報資訊 ・ 22 小時前 ・ 發表留言\n\n《美股》消息面：華許若就任 川普喊GDP飆15%；美發警示 油價彈升 【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】消息面：

Lutnick）接受CNBC訪問時公開提到，他希望在川普總統任內，台灣40%的晶片供應鏈轉移到美國。當時他說道：「我們將在美國建造巨型的半導體產業園區……這是讓我們把半導體帶回美國之5000億美元的頭期款」，他並表示，不在美國建廠的台灣晶片公司，可能面臨川普曾揚言要課徵的100%半導體關稅。 半導體產業分析師普遍認同鄭麗君的說法，即華府這項最野心勃勃的半導體回流計畫根本不可行，因為要轉移如此先進的供應鏈存在許多困難。 分析師和業內人士表示，美國這項計劃的主要障礙包括台灣半導體生態圈高度整合、美國的勞動力短缺，以及成\n時報資訊 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n川普力推「美國製造」卻反噬本土工廠？ 陸企強勢壓境爆爭議

美國勞工部將於當地時間周三發布備受關注的非農就業報告。市場預期該報告將顯示1月失業率維持在4.4%不變，以及薪資年增長放緩。經濟學家表示，川普政府的貿易和移民政策抑制了就業市場，但減稅應可提振今年的招聘力道。 通常每年1月是季節性裁員最嚴重的月份，但由於去年底零售、物流等季節性招聘減少，因此今年1月的裁員情況可能隨之減少，或許會推升就業增長。 KPMG首席經濟學家Diane Swonk表示，就業市場潛在的壓力比整體失業率所呈現的要大。薪資增長正在減速、失業後更難找到工作、應屆畢業生要找到工作也更加困難。儘管報告上的經濟數據看起來很火熱，但勞動力市場依舊寒氣逼人。 根據路透社所做的調查，受訪經濟學家預估2025年1月非農就業可能增加7萬人，超出12月份的新增5萬人。預測值在介於減少1萬人到增加13.5萬人之間。一些私人調查顯示1月可能出現就業減少的情況。

發佈根據美國地質調查局2月6日發布的年度《礦產商品摘要》，2025年美國非燃料礦產總產值年增5.6%，達到1,120億美元，主要受黃金與白銀等貴金屬價格上漲的帶動。報告同時凸顯非燃料礦產對美國航太、電子與建築等產業的整體重要性。依賴礦產的相關產業於2025年創造了4.09兆美元的產值，占美國經濟總量的八分之一以上。 美國地質調查局局長內德·馬穆拉表示：「關鍵礦產已成為美國政府政策制定與國際關係中的核心議題。2025年，礦產相關產業為美國經濟貢獻超過4兆美元，顯然礦產將成為二十一世紀全球經濟的命脈。三十年來，這些報告持續揭示礦產的重要性，以及美國對關鍵礦產進口依賴程度的上升。而川普政府所推動的政策、協議與重大投資，已開始著手降低這種依賴。」 內華達州連續第二年成為礦產產值最高的州，但亞利桑那州的產值超越德州，躍居第二。內華達州曾於2015年至2020年間居首，之後2021年與2022年由亞利桑那州領先，2023年則由德州居冠。 亞利桑那州之所以超越德州，主因在於銅、鉬、黃金與白銀的產值上升。德州方面，建築相關礦產的產值雖\nMoneydj理財網 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n《國際產業》不能只給台積電甜頭 傳川普即將祭晶片稅

報導指出，這項由美國商務部審批的關稅豁免，將與最近達成的美台貿易協議相結合。台積電依據這項貿易協議取得的關稅豁免配額可分配給美國大型科技公司，好讓這些客戶能免稅進口台積電的晶片。 報導稱這項關稅豁免計畫凸顯出川普政府開徵晶片關稅、促進本地製造晶片的決心，同時也給高度仰賴進口半導體、正在美國推動AI快速發展的科技公司提供緩衝空間。 受訪的美國政府官員表示，相關計劃尚未拍板，也尚未獲得川普簽署。 美國政府官員透露，美方在計畫公布後，會像老鷹一樣緊盯後續進展，「以確保我們能透過關稅和退稅切實達成目標，也可避免這最終演變成只給台積電送上大禮」。 美國商務部在1月中旬宣布與台灣達成貿易協議，台灣晶片和科技公司將在美國投資至少2500億美元生產晶片和打造晶片工廠，而台灣政府將為這些公司提供信貸擔保2500億美元。作為交換條件，美方將給予台灣「15%且不疊加」的對等關稅稅率，並承諾對\n時報資訊 ・

Trump）不滿韓國國會尚未通過去年與美國達成的貿易協議，上月揚言調高從韓國進口產品關稅。根據該協議，韓國承諾將向美國投資3500億美元。韓國兩大黨國會領袖上週在簡報會上已預告，今天將設立特別委員會，該委員會擁有法案草擬權，並預定3月9日前拍板法案。韓聯社報導，韓國產業通商部長官金正官今天表示，上週曾與美國商務部長盧特尼克（HowardLutnick）舉行兩次視訊會議，對於韓國朝野同意在一個月內完成對美投資特別法案立法程序，盧特尼克給予高度評價。金正官並稱，通常美方在總統表態後3天至1週內便會在「聯邦公報」（Federal Register）刊登相關措施，但自川普上月發表相關言論以來已過去2週，相關措施迄今仍未登報，這在一定程度上反映出美方認可韓方的努力。金正官也強調，鑒於川普主要將問題歸咎於立法延誤，若相關問題得以解決，關稅上調獲得暫緩的可能性較大。\n中央社財經 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n道瓊尾盤漲幅差點全吐 川普或增派第二支航母艦隊駛向伊朗

【財訊快報／記者王宜弘報導】根據DIGITIMES最新產銷調查顯示，去年第四季全球筆電出貨表現優於原先預期，主因記憶體價格於第四季出現明顯飆漲，且漲勢預期延續至今年初，促使品牌業者為降低未來成本壓力而提前備貨，進而推升第四季筆電出貨量。而提前拉貨亦墊高比較基期，今年首季全球筆電出貨面臨明顯回檔壓力，將有較顯著季減。DIGITIMES分析師張珩表示，從供給面觀察，2026年首季面臨筆電主要生產基地因春節假期而工時縮減的問題，預計產能將減少而不利出貨。且記憶體價格持續上漲，平價機款不易透過降規方式因應，因此品牌業者勢將面臨成本壓力，部分機款出貨轉為保守。需求端方面，消費市場及商務市場皆因預期終端價格將上漲而提前於2025年第四季消費及採購，加上首季本屬筆電消費市場傳統淡季，整體需求明顯轉弱，將加重全球筆電出貨下滑壓力，預估今年首季全球筆電出貨約4,039萬台，季減逾13%，年減逾4%。就品牌表現而言，2026年首季全球筆電品牌業者出貨排名預期將維持不變，但個別品牌表現方面則是漲跌互見。聯想(Lenovo)、宏碁(2353)及蘋果(Apple)於首季出貨相對較佳，其中，蘋果將受惠新品效應，是\n財訊快報

2.43元；2025全年歸屬母公司業主淨利16.94億元、年增121%，每股盈餘4元。展望2026年第一季，穩懋指出，受傳統淡季及較少工作天數的影響，單季營收預計將較前一季下滑高個位數百分比，合併毛利率則約為25%上下的水準。穩懋去年第四季合併營收47.94億元，較前一季成長7%，與前一年同期相比成長 29%，略優於原先的預期。單季毛利率31.8%，較上一季上升4.9個百分點，產能利用率維持上一季的60%，毛利率成長主要歸功於產品組合優於上一季，加上合併子公司轉投資中國客戶上市股票相關利益貢獻合併毛利率約0.45個百分點。穩懋表示，去年第四季Infrastructure（通訊基礎建設）延續前一季的動能，仍然是成長最為強勁的族群，營收持續成長。在WiFi方面，隨著美系旗艦手機鋪貨旺季逐漸進入尾聲，以及路由器市場需求較弱，第四季Wi-Fi

【財訊快報／劉敏夫】外電報導指出，富時羅素發表「2026馬年中國市場展望」指出，中國在2025年實現了全年實際GDP增長5%的目標，主要得益於第四季4.5%的穩健擴張。富時羅素表示，儘管對美國出口年比值大幅下降20%，但中國成功將貿易流向轉向更為多元化的市場，包括東盟、歐洲和非洲，因此商品出口表現強勁，進口相對低迷，為其擴大了經常帳盈餘，提振宏觀經濟提供了重要助力。富時羅素指出，雖然消費品補貼效應逐步減弱後，零售銷售在第四季動能放緩，中國工業活動在全年依然保持亮眼成績。強勁的出口表現持續支撐工業部門，促使2025年工業利潤年比值微增0.6%，成為自2021年以來的首次正增長。富時羅素還指出，結構性阻力依然存在。勞動力市場持續疲軟，以及第四季房地產銷售和房地產投資進一步萎縮，家庭情緒和消費持續承壓。此外，通縮壓力也依然嚴峻，生產者價格自2022年第四季以來一直處於負值區間。展望2026年，中國將以國內需求、創新和高科技投資作為經濟增長的關鍵驅動力，並輔以擴張性的財政政策。\n財訊快報

英國金融時報9日引述未具名消息人士報導，美國商務部正在規劃，為國內超大規模雲端服務商(hyperscalers)提供關稅豁免(tariff carve-outs)。這些豁免跟台積電(2330)的投資承諾息息相關。 傳聞中的豁免機制顯示，川普政府推行晶片關稅、獎勵本土晶片製造的同時，也為支持美國迅速擴張AI的企業提供些許緩衝，因為這些企業高度仰賴進口的晶片。儘管川普以關稅威脅作為推動美國製造的手段，但至今仍未對進口自台灣的半導體全面實施關稅，以免動搖大型科技公司的供應鏈。 白宮1月曾宣布，準備對晶片進口商課徵「高昂」關稅。然而，新的方案會允許台積電為美國客戶分配下一波關稅的豁免額度，這些額度跟台積電在美國的投資規模掛勾。 這項複雜的計劃旨在促使台積電把更多產能移往美國。透露消息的政府官員表示，上述計畫仍未定案，總\nMoneydj理財網 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n學術與商業的碰撞？xAI兩天痛失2位共同創辦人 MoneyDJ新聞 2026-02-11

發佈本週市場焦點聚焦美國經濟數據表現。由於最新出爐的12月零售銷售報告不如預期，顯示美國經濟動能似乎出現放緩跡象，引發買盤湧入債市，美債殖利率10日全面走低。 根據CNBC報價，紐約債市10日尾盤時，對聯準會（Fed）貨幣政策較為敏感的2年期公債殖利率略跌逾3個基點至3.452%；10年期公債殖利率滑落逾5個基點至4.141%；30年期公債殖利率也下跌逾5個基點至4.781%。（註：公債價格與殖利率呈現反向走勢。） 美國商務部10日公布12月零售銷售額，為觀察美國內需動能的重要指標。數據顯示，12月零售銷售額與前月持平，明顯低於11月的0.6%增幅，也不及道瓊調查預估的0.4%，原因包括關稅造成物價上漲，使民眾支出趨於保守。 展望本週，還有多項重磅經濟數據陸續揭曉。其中，原定於6日公布的1月非農就業報告，因先前聯邦政府局部停擺而延至11日發布。根據道瓊（Dow

While these results were positive compared to forecasts, they represented a decline from the same period in the previous year when the company reported adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share. However, the key driver for the stock's rise appeared to be the company's upbeat outlook. For the first quarter of 2026, Entegris forecasted revenue between $785 million and $825 million, with adjusted earnings per share ranging from $0.70 to $0.78.

The analog chip maker posted an adjusted EPS of $0.64, beating the consensus estimate of $0.62. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, in line with expectations but representing an 11.2% decline from the previous year. However, the positive earnings surprise was tempered by the company's forecast for the first quarter, which projected both revenue and earnings below Wall Street's projections. Despite the weak outlook, investors appeared to focus on the better-than-expected profit and a strong free cash flow margin of 31.7% for the quarter. The stock's rally represented a significant reversal from an initial 4.6% drop immediately following the earnings release, suggesting a shift in sentiment as the market digested the full report.",

2.49% 及 2.47%。\n不過，在多空交戰激烈下，市場「懼高症」隱憂浮現，投資人擔心是否該抱股過年。主動第一金台股優經理人張正中指出，AI 題材不煞車，春節後資金可望加速回流，為多頭添柴加薪，若無黑天鵝出現，歷年春節後台股行情多半呈現大漲小回格局，投資人不妨利用主動 ETF 參與年後金馬奔馳行情。\n\n張正中認為，從 ChatGPT 驅動 AI 產業爆炸性成長以來，AI 科技升級變化速度明顯高於過往，目前評價低於網路泡沫時期，CSP 資本支出持續擴張下，台灣去年第四季 GDP 高達 12.68%，創 38 年來單季新高，多家機構預測今年度 GDP 可達 4%，瑞銀甚至上看 6.9%，為台股後市增添信心。\n\n這波台股攻高，主要由 AI 關鍵供應鏈推升，台積電屢創新天價，市場波動度也加大，部分投資人擔心長假抱股過年風險，張正中強調，AI 產業仍是引領市場成長的重要動力，00994A 鎖定強趨勢產業、篩選最強勢個股，第一大持股權重最高可達 30%，集中火力投資，緊跟投資市場脈動，提供投資人參與台股金馬行情機會，00994A 也提供每季收益分配機制，提供投資人定期收益機會。\n※免責聲明：文中所提的個股、基金、期貨商品內容僅供參考，並非投資建議，投資人應獨立判斷，審慎評估風險，自負盈虧。\n更多鉅亨報導\n•

【時報-台北電】台股元月狂飆3100點，連過2萬9、3萬、3萬1、3萬2等4關卡，只差4點就衝上3萬3，連帶科技ETF也寫下驚人表現，分析師股添樂表示，有9檔ETF績效超越大盤11.5%，甚至是大盤2倍，比如00947大賺25%，就因為前3大持股，都是市場最熱的記憶體飆股，這還不是最狠的，賺滿資本利得就拿來配息，年化從11.7%衝到14.8%，簡直把高股息ETF的活兒都給搶走了。 股添樂在臉書「股添樂股市新觀點」表示，噴！噴！噴！元月台股就是一直噴！如果就連指數漲幅都像搭上火車，那科技股表現就是坐上火箭！今年才過1個月，不少科技ETF績效已經狠甩大盤，甚至交出大盤2倍漲幅。

主動群益台灣強棒（00982A）經理人陳沅易指出，台股農曆年後在紅包行情預期下，台股量能可望進一步增溫，普遍也有不錯的投資機會，台股基金或ETF透過專業經理人與選股機制篩選來降低選股的不確定性，也有助分散投資風險。展望台股後勢，選股難度提高，農曆年前預估呈現震盪，台股待農曆春節過後趨正向發展。可留意長線趨勢，把握AI產業優質企業及衍生機器人、通訊、消費電子產業。

【時報-台北電】美國總統川普政府的對等關稅，曾於2025年4月初造成台股由23,000以上高點下挫至18,000點以下。然在大跌之後，股市展現韌性呈現破底翻轉並一路震盪走高，2025年12月31日台灣加權股價指數以28,963點歷史最高封關，全年上漲25.74％，表現亮眼。 台股在大跌後反轉走高的主要動力在於美國AI投資挹注經濟增長及企業獲利，並進一步帶動台灣AI供應鏈出貨且一舉將台灣2025年GDP增長率推升至8.63％，創15年新高。展望2026年，全球金融市場關注以下三大變數交錯影響，包括美國期中選舉、美國聯準會主席改選，以及AI技術的加速發展。 首先，美國國會期中選舉預計於2026年11月舉行，將重塑國會的權力結構。如果出現政黨翻轉或分裂政府的局勢，將對稅制改革、基礎建設、科技監管等政策造成轉折。群益認為，為了爭取選票，預期川普政府將採取更多民生優惠及放鬆監管等利多政策，原先施行嚴格的關稅政策也將逐步退縮，有利物價逐步走低。

（中央社記者廖漢原紐約2026年02月8日專電）美股道瓊工業指數上週首破5萬點關卡，美國總統川普推文預測任期內將漲至10萬點。財政部長貝森特今天表示，美國經濟已進入週期性循環復原。就業與通膨報告是本週影響美股動態的觀察重點。道瓊工業指數6日收盤首度突破5萬點關卡，美國總統川普（Donald Trump）在個人社媒推文，專家說道指在他任期結束前達到5萬點就算重大表現，但他提早3年完成。川普接連推文，股市創紀錄和美國國家安全都是關稅所驅動，他預測指數卸任前將達到10萬點。美國股市自川普第2任期上任至今，道指漲幅約為15.2%，期間對全球推出對等關稅，導致包括政府公債等美元資產與美元信心下跌，貴金屬價格狂飆，AI人工智慧業者持續引領資金浪潮。美股未來漲幅難以預料，不過道指表現今年超過那斯達克與標普500，顯示美國從科技資通訊到消費零售、金融銀行業均普遍成長。分析師多認為美國經濟週期循環是這波漲幅的主要因素。財政部長貝森特（Scott

【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】在科技股上漲帶動下，周一(2月9日)四大指數再度收高，標普500指數距離收盤歷史高點僅差臨門一腳。道瓊指數繼上周五首度收盤站在5萬點重大里程碑後再創收盤與盤中新高。由AI晶片熱門股輝達漲2.5%、台積電ADR漲1.88%、博通和超微漲超過3%帶動，費半表現相對亮眼。 投資人將關注本周陸續公布的非農就業等重大經濟數據和新一批財報。 儘管這兩天科技股表現亮眼，但如果本周發布的業績報喜，最近從科技股轉出的輪動仍有可能在本周再度上演。可口可樂和福特汽車將於周二發布季報。 投資人也將關注美國勞工統計局延後於本周三發布的1月就業報告。該關鍵就業數據原本應於上周五發布，但由於政府局部停擺而推遲。市場預估美國1月非農就業增加55,000人。 上周ADP發布的1月民間就業僅增加22,000人，遠不及市場預期。 1月消費者物價指數（CPI）亦因政府停擺而延至本周五公布，市場預估CPI年漲2.5%。 根據芝商所FedWatch工具，目前市場押注聯準會將在6月會議宣告今年的首次降息，屆時美國總統川普提名的聯準會主席人選華許（Kevin Warsh）可能已經就任。 周一收盤，道瓊指\n時報資訊 ・ 4 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\nAI疑慮再起美股跌多漲少 台積電ADR漲超1.8％

（中央社記者張謙香港2026年02月12日電）據報導，美國總統川普預計於4月初訪問中國，屆時他與中國國家主席習近平在北京會面時，美中準備把雙方在韓國達成的貿易休戰協議延長至多1年。南華早報今天在報導中表示，去年10月，美中兩國領導人在韓國釜山舉行雙邊會面後達成了一項暫時休戰協議。此前數月，中美關係持續緊張，雙方曾加徵3位數字的「報復性」關稅，北京方面也宣布全面抵制美國農產品，禁令持續到2025年的大部分時間。此後，中美關係恢復，中國也恢復購買美國大豆。報導引述多名消息人士說，相關官員認為，延長長達數月的非正式諒解是現實及可行的，可以令峰會焦點圍繞著短期經濟成果，包括中國新的採購承諾。據報導，由於越來越擔心能否保住國會多數席位，川普正敦促各方在11月中期選舉前拿出實際成果。上週，川普在與習近平進行了近兩個小時通話後透露，北京正考慮從美國購買更多大豆。報導又引述4位知情人士透露，川普預計於4月初訪問中國；其中兩人表示，最初考慮的抵達日期是3月31日，屆時他將與習近平在4月首週舉行雙邊會晤，而此行維持3天左右。但消息人士說，川普訪問中國的具體時間仍在討論中，因為北京方面正在考慮清明節（4月5\n中央社財經

美國貿易代表署（USTR）於社群平台X發布最新貼文該貼文巧妙運用「雙關語」致敬美國總統川普的經典著作，大讚其關稅政策成功讓美國在國際談判中取得優勢。川普對此也大方表態，強調正是因為強硬的關稅手段，才讓全球各國紛紛低頭，「同意支付更多錢」。 有趣的是，「對等貿易協定」的英文縮寫正好是「ART」，正好呼應了川普在1987年出版的暢銷書《交易的藝術》（The Art of the Deal）。 在此背景下，台美關稅協議也贏來新突破，在歷經9個月的密集談判後，雙方於華盛頓正式簽署「台美對等貿易協定」（ART）。 這項協定不僅象徵兩國關稅談判圓滿落幕，美國貿易代表葛里爾（Jamieson Greer）更強調，此舉將大幅提升高科技產業的供應鏈韌性。 由行政院副院長鄭麗君與經貿辦總談判代表楊珍妮率領的團隊，本週赴美完成最後一哩路。在鄭麗君\n時報資訊 ・ 23 小時前 ・

Hegseth)執行，與煤電廠簽訂協議，購買電力以支持軍事行動。以相關計畫尚未公開為由要求匿名的知情官員表示，此舉預計將動用1950年《國防生產法》下的冷戰時期特殊授權，該法賦予白宮廣泛的權力，可以指導私營行業維護國家安全。川普政府也曾在第一個總統任期考慮過類似方法。這位官員表示，總統還將宣布能源部計畫撥款1.75億美元，用於肯塔基州、北卡羅來納州、俄亥俄州、維吉尼亞州和西維吉尼亞州六座燃煤電廠的升級改造。能源部去年宣布了可用資金，並表示此舉旨在提高一些燃煤電廠的效率並延長其營運時間。在川普宣布這些舉措之際，煤炭企業高層主管、採礦商和能源行業領導人將訪問白宮。這些舉措是川普為振興日漸衰落的煤炭行業而採取的最新努力。\n財訊快報

【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】聯準會理事米蘭（Stephen Miran）周一表示，數據顯示美國人並沒有受到關稅衝擊。川普政府的貿易關稅政策已經證明比許多人所擔心的要溫和。外國人和他們的公司才是主要為關稅上漲買單的人，而不是美國人。 不過，米蘭的言論似乎與數據相互矛盾。數據顯示支付關稅的負擔落在美國人身上。 周一，在波士頓大學Questrom商學院發表演說時，米蘭表示，我認為在一些議題上，世界已經逐漸認同我的方向。他特別提到了關稅及其對經濟的影響，並表示一年前，當川普的第二任期剛開始時，大家都擔心大幅提高進口稅會打擊美國經濟。我認為許多專家隨著時間逐漸認同了我的觀點，並認為關稅對經濟的影響「相當有限」。 米蘭也反駁經濟學界普遍存在的觀點：關稅推升物價，進而由美國民眾承擔，而非由出口國犧牲利潤來承擔。 去年底，美國總統川普曾經承認，由於他提高關稅，美國人正面臨物價上漲，雖然這項政策總體而言對美國經濟是有利的，但我認為「美國人可能得付出一些代價」。 聯準會曾表示，2026年通膨率將超過2%目標，大多是因為關稅壓力。 耶魯預算實驗室（Yale Budget Lab）上個月底出具報告指出，每戶\n時報資訊 ・ 3 天前 ・ 發表留言\n\n鬆綁美豬牛 政院提4不變

【時報編譯張朝欽綜合外電報導】OpenAI對美國國會議員警告說，中國的DeepSeek正在瞄準OpenAI以及美國其它頂尖的AI公司，複製他們的模型，並且用於自己的訓練。 OpenAI執行長奧特曼(Sam Altman)指責DeepSeek：「持續地努力利用OpenAI和其它美國尖端實驗室開發的能量」。 DeepSeek這種被稱為「蒸餾」的技術，涉及到使用更成熟和強大的舊AI模型，來評估新模型答案的品質，並有效地轉移舊模型的學習過程。 OpenAI在週四發給美國眾議院一個特別委員會的備忘錄，指出DeepSeek員工相關的帳戶正在開發能繞過OpenAI訪問限制和訪問模型的方法，主要是透過混淆的第三方路由器和其它可以掩蓋來源的方式，來迴避訪問限制。 OpenAI說，DeepSeek的員工開發了代碼，以便獲取美國AI模型的訪問，並獲取了輸出結果。 DeepSeek是在2025年初推出了AI模型，足以媲美美國最好的產品，當時也震撼了市場，認為無需使用先進的AI晶片，僅在AI模型的進步，也可以推理出優異的成果。 OpenAI說，公司會主動移除那些似乎試圖提取模型、以便開發出競爭模型的用戶。\n時報資訊 ・ 18 小時前 ・

【財訊快報／劉敏夫】外電報導指出，韓國加密貨幣交易所Bithumb週三表示，其內部系統存在嚴重漏洞，易遭受潛在破壞，且未能阻止上週發生的逾400億美元資產錯誤轉帳事件。Bithumb這家韓國第二大虛擬資產交易所表示，在一次推廣活動中，平台誤向用戶發放了約62萬枚比特幣，而非原本的62萬韓元(426美元)，此舉導致比特幣價格暴跌17%。Bithumb首席執行長Lee Jae-won表示，此次誤發的資產規模相當於該交易所持有量(4.2萬枚比特幣)的15倍。主要原因是交易處理存在約24小時的延遲，導致虛擬資產餘額更新被延後。Lee Jae-won就該事件舉行的國會聽證會上表示，我們深刻意識到內部系統管控存在缺陷。交易所原本用於核對轉帳金額與實際持有資產量的風控機制失效，且涉事資金也未劃入獨立帳戶以保障交易安全。監管機構表示，Bithumb已追回大部分比特幣，但在交易所凍結收款用戶帳戶前的幾分鐘內，已有1,786枚比特幣被售出。售出這些比特幣的用戶在法律上有義務返還所得。韓國國會議員對政府及企業在虛擬資產市場的監管失職表示失望。按交易量計算，韓國是全球虛擬資產交易最活躍的市場之一。金融監督院(\n財訊快報

烏克蘭官員也反擊表示，俄羅斯在週四夜間向烏克蘭發射了無人機和彈道飛彈，攻擊了烏克蘭的能源系統，導致首都基輔、第聶伯羅(Dnipro)地區的部分城市，以及奧德薩市(Odesa)數以萬計的人斷暖、斷電、斷水。 伏爾加格勒地區的州長Andrei Bocharov在社群媒體Telegram上表示，伏爾加格勒和附近地區有許多民房和汽車遭到破壞，有3個人被送往醫院。

Alphabet、甲骨文是少數幾家開始大舉融資的科技企業，以資助AI基礎建設的龐大投資案。截至2025年3月，Alphabet申報的長期債務還不到110億美元。 值得注意的是，Alphabet重返債市為AI建設融資之際，也坦承AI崛起、基礎建設的大規模投資存在新風險。 Alphabet上週公佈財報時，特地提到AI對核心廣告業務的潛在風險，以及高昂投資承諾導致「產能過剩」(excess

Alphabet發債規模高於外界預期的150億美元，認購金額逾1,000億美元。繼甲骨文去年9月發行180億美元債券後，臉書母公司Meta、亞馬遜和Alphabet也持續大舉發債，顯示投資人仍然看好科技業透過舉債來支持其AI擴張。 金融時報引述知情者的消息報導，Alphabet還計劃發行以英鎊計價的3年期到100年期公司債，和以瑞士法郎計價的3年期到25年期公司債。

分析師指出，百年期公司債向來罕見，多由主權國家發行，企業參與比例有限，主要投資人為保險公司與退休基金，用以因應長期負債需求。Alphabet此次進軍英鎊超長天期市場，顯示其積極爭取長期機構資金，同時反映資本市場對AI題材的高度熱情，但同時亦加深外界對泡沫化風險的疑慮。 Wind Shift Capital執行長布萊恩（Bill

【財訊快報／陳孟朔】美國交通部發布航行公告，要求懸掛美國國旗的船隻在經過荷姆茲海峽和安曼灣時盡量遠離伊朗領海影響，兩大期油週一追高超過1%。市場對美、伊緊張局勢可能導致供應中斷的擔憂重燃，抵銷先前因雙方重申繼續間接談判而帶來的跌勢。布蘭特4月期油收盤上漲99美分或1.5%，結算價為每桶69.04美元；紐約3月期油漲81美分或1.3%，收於每桶64.36美元。上述兩大期油上週五各收高0.7%和0.4%。儘管美、伊雙方形容近期討論具積極性，但伊朗外交部長上週六警告，若遭美軍攻擊，將回擊美國在海灣地區的基地，使地緣政治風險溢價持續注入市場。除中東局勢外，投資人也密切關注對俄羅斯石油出口的新制裁。歐盟委員會提議全面禁止支持俄羅斯海運原油出口的相關服務，且消息人士指出，印度煉油商正避免購買4月交付的俄羅斯原油。分析師認為，若印度完全停止採購俄油，將構成油市持續看漲的動力。在產量方面，由雪佛龍領導的哈薩克騰吉茲(Tengiz)巨型油田產能已恢復至峰值的60%，預計2月23日恢復全線生產。此外，路透初步調查顯示，上週美國原油庫存可能增加，而汽油及蒸餾油庫存預期將減少。\n財訊快報

【時報-台北電】美國總統川普將於週三（11日）在白宮會晤以色列總理尼坦雅胡（Benjamin Netanyahu），也是川普第二任期以來，兩人第7次會晤。預料雙方將就伊朗核談判、加薩停火及中東安全情勢進行深入討論。尼坦雅胡此行重點，將爭取美方在與伊朗談判中納入飛彈與區域安全議題，而不僅限於核計畫。 路透社報導，尼坦雅胡總理希望能藉由這次會面，在美國和伊朗於阿曼進行核子談判之後，對華府接下來的對伊政策產生影響。川普總統之前曾經警告說，如果無法與伊朗達成協議，美國可能會採取軍事打擊的手段，而德黑蘭方面也公開表示將會採取報復行動，這使得中東地區的局勢升溫，衝突的風險也因此加劇。 川普總統在接受媒體採訪時提到，「一個好的協議」必須確保伊朗「沒有核武器、沒有飛彈」，並且表示如果德黑蘭拒絕讓步，美國將會採取「非常強硬」的行動。他也透露，美國正在考慮向伊朗周邊地區增派第二支航空母艦打擊群，以加強軍事部署。 以色列方面擔心，美國可能只會尋求一項狹義的協議，僅僅限制伊朗的核計畫，而沒有將彈道飛彈的發展，以及伊朗對哈瑪斯、真主黨等代理武裝力量的支持納入考量。

美國財政部長貝森特在美國福斯新聞(Fox News)節目中也說，川普與高市早苗的關係很好，當日本強大時，代表美國在亞洲也強大。在八日大選前幾天，川普已表態會全力支持高市，並於三月19日在白宮歡迎這位日本第一位女首相。 日媒指出，高市千尋下個月在就任首相以來，可望首次訪美，且時間上要早於川普計畫四月訪中。幾個月以來，中國一直對高市關於潛在性的台海危機言論，抱持非常強硬的立場。

【財訊快報／陳孟朔】受美國與伊朗緊張升溫，以及歐盟研議加碼收緊俄羅斯石油出口制裁影響，兩大期油在連二紅後，在亞洲週一電子盤初翻空小跌。布蘭特4月期油下跌0.25美元或0.4%至每桶68.79美元，紐約3月期油跌0.23美元或0.4%至每桶64.13美元。兩大期油前兩個交易日各漲了2.2%和1.7%。週一油價一度大漲逾1%，主因美國交通部海事管理局發布最新安全建議，要求美籍商船通過荷姆茲海峽時，盡可能遠離伊朗領海，若遭要求登船則以口頭方式婉拒(若被強行登船則不建議以武力抵抗)，市場解讀為地緣風險再度升溫。分析師指出，荷姆茲海峽為全球能源運輸要道，全球相當比重的原油供應需經此航道，任何攔截、扣船或封鎖疑慮都會放大油價波動；即便伊朗方面提及在阿曼斡旋下的對話出現正向訊號，市場對衝突外溢的風險溢價仍難快速消退。另一方面，歐盟最新一籃子制裁提案傳出將把範圍延伸至格魯吉亞與印尼的港口，以更全面封堵俄油出口與「繞道」流通路徑；同時，印度石油公司近期也自西非與中東採購約600萬桶原油，市場解讀為在貿易與地緣結構重組下，部分買方正調整來源以降低對俄油依賴，後續將牽動供需平衡與運價。\n財訊快報

Trump）去年夏天對進口鋼鋁課徵最高達50%的關稅，並將課稅範圍擴及許多鋼鋁製品，例如洗碗機和烤箱。不過根據3名知情人士，川普政府現正審查受鋼鋁關稅影響的產品清單，計劃給予部分品項豁免、停止擴大課稅清單，並轉而對特定商品展開更具針對性的國家安全調查。這些知情人士透露，美國商務部及美國貿易代表署（USTR）的貿易官員認為，這些關稅促使烤盤、食品罐和飲料罐等商品漲價，對消費者造成傷害。川普的關稅攻勢使美國關稅水準攀升至第二次世界大戰戰前以來最高峰，不過隨著選民對美國生活成本危機的不滿日益加劇，川普已多次撤回部分最嚴格的關稅措施。皮尤研究中心（Pew Research Center）本月發布的民調顯示，逾7成美國成年人認為當前經濟狀況「普通」或「不佳」，約52%美國人認為川普的經濟政策導致情況惡化。美國商務部、美國貿易代表署及\n中央社財經 ・ 17 小時前 ・ 發表留言\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身

年 12 月底相比大增 48.2 億元、人數同期成長 43.3 萬，平均每人單月扣款接近萬元，帶動元大投信旗下基金單月定期定額來到 105 億元，領先市場。\n\n元大投信指出，0050 為台灣首檔市值型 ETF，成立以來至 2026 年 1 月含息報酬率為 1511%，以每年 250 交易日換算年化報酬率約為 13.3%。市值型設計將始終跟隨市場主流趨勢，成分股市值變化會直接反映於 0050 股價表現，高效率參與台股行情，2025 年優化費用率、股價分割後，帶動市值型投資策略認同度提升。\n\n在 0050 之外，元大投信定期定額前五名投資標的還包括元大高股息 (0056-TW)、元大台灣高息低波 (00713-TW)、元大 S&P500(00646-TW)、元大臺灣 ESG 永續 (00850-TW)，均為證交所定期定額戶數排行榜前 20 名。\n元大 S&P500 所追蹤的標普 500 指數，為美國最具代表性大盤指數，多次獲股神巴菲特推薦一般投資人應選擇標普 500 指數基金作為核心配置。據 S&P Global 統計，截至 2025 年 6 月 30 日的 20 年期間，標普 500 指數長期報酬優於 91% 美國大型股票基金，且時間愈長，愈能突顯被動投資優勢。對於台灣投資人而言，可透過 00646 建立美股資產，與 0050 進行搭配。\n元大投信表示，定期定額及早開始比擇時進場重要，面對股市長期向上趨勢，雖然定期定額成果短期內較易受市場波動影響，但長期會因為投入資金筆數增加而平均投資成本，進而反映長期投資優勢。\n元大投信並提醒，0050 為純粹的市值型 ETF，集中反映主要上市權值股表現，持續建議投資人透過定期定額分散單筆投入風險，投資前應有完整的資金投入規劃，以避免過度承受單一年度大跌風險。00646 為新台幣計價之美股 ETF，實際投資成果會受到基金成本與匯率變化影響，將與指數表現有所差異。\n※免責聲明：文中所提的個股、基金、期貨商品內容僅供參考，並非投資建議，投資人應獨立判斷，審慎評估風險，自負盈虧。\n更多鉅亨報導\n&bull; 〈台股盤後〉暴力反彈621點登第10大漲點 記億體大復活群飆漲停\n&bull; 日股強勢回歸！「早苗經濟學」點火

主動群益科技創新（00992A）經理人陳朝政指出，台股隨著評價面走高，股市波動難免，預期盤勢將震盪加劇，整體看來，往年Q1歷史經驗迎接旺季，台股平均漲幅3.3％，加上進入降息循環，以及台股企業獲利持續上修，因此對於後市仍屬樂觀看待。 不過，在科技產業成長趨勢未變以及內需穩健下，中長線還是持續看好，布局策略應著重公司長期發展優勢，可優先佈局半導體先進製程、半導體材料、通訊等族群，以及AI應用以及提高生產力族群。
