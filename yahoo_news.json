      "Content": "Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is one of the AI stocks currently on Wall Street’s radar .\n\nMarvell Technology drew fresh analyst support from Stifel this week. On February 11, analyst Tore Svanberg reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $114.00 price target. The firm has updated its model post XConn acquisition, noting long-term UALink upside despite limited near-term EPS impact.\n\nThe data infrastructure semiconductor solutions leader announced on Tuesday that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of XConn Technologies, a provider of advanced PCIe and CXL switching silicon. The deal aims to strengthen Marvell’s UALink capabilities in the long term.\n\nThe firm has updated its model following this acquisition, incorporating its impacts. It anticipates initial revenue contributions to begin in Marvell’s fiscal third quarter of 2027, accelerating to a $50 million annualized run rate by the fourth quarter. Stifel has also increased its FY28 revenue estimate by $100 million to reflect the anticipated XConn contribution.\n\nHowever, Marvell’s financials are going to be impacted in several ways. This includes an adjustment to FY27 non-GAAP operating expenses by an estimated $25 million annually and a decrease in Other Income by approximately $12 million annually because of reduced interest income from the $325 million cash outlay.\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) develops and manufactures semiconductors, with a heavy focus on data centers.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Quick, what's the first thing you think of when you hear Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ? The vast majority of respondents would likely mention the e-commerce platform. However, while the platform is the most consumer-facing part of Amazon's business, it's far from the most exciting.\n\nInstead, Amazon's cloud computing and chip business is by far the best reason to invest in the stock.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nAlthough there were some questions surrounding whether Amazon would be able to compete with more AI-focused peers, Amazon's growth is starting to accelerate, and it could be one of the best stocks to own in 2026.\n\nTo me, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top reason to invest in Amazon stock. AWS is Amazon's cloud computing platform, and is the largest cloud computing player in the world. At the start of the AI build-out, AWS didn't fare as well as its competitors, like Google Cloud and Azure. However, it's starting to gain momentum.\n\nAWS revenue rose 24% year over year in the fourth quarter -- the best growth in 13 quarters. So, not only is AWS excelling, it's getting stronger. One of AWS' secret weapons is the chips that it has designed in-house. While Amazon didn't elaborate on the exact growth rate, the cloud computing business using its chips rose in the triple-digit range during Q4.\n\nClearly, customers like what they're getting from Amazon's in-house chips, and these could serve as a cheaper alternative to running workloads on more expensive hardware from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . If this trend persists throughout 2026, don't be surprised to see Amazon's stock rally.\n\nWhile Amazon may be known for its commerce services, AWS actually provides most of its profits.\n\nIn Q4, AWS accounted for 17% of total revenue. However, when you shift the focus to operating profits, its share changes. In Q4, AWS generated $12.5 billion in operating income. Companywide, Amazon generated $25 billion. So, despite making up 17% of sales, AWS generated half of its operating profits. Keep in mind, Amazon's holiday quarter is usually its commerce division's most profitable quarter, so this metric is usually more skewed toward AWS throughout the year. In Q3, AWS made up 66% of operating profits.\n\nThe reality is, AWS is the driver behind Amazon's stock. With AWS growing faster than its commerce segment, Amazon will continue to deliver stellar companywide results. I think it's clear that AWS is set up to thrive in today's AI-first environment, making the stock a great buy after its post-earnings sell-off.",

      "Content": "Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY ) is one of the best foreign stocks to buy right now . On February 9, Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey cut the price target on Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) to JPY4,250 from JPY5,100 and maintained a Buy rating. The adjustment followed Sony’s FY25 Q3 earnings report, where the company beat analyst expectations.\n\nHickey pointed to standout performances in key areas. The analyst noted particularly strong results in Sony’s Imaging & Sensing Solutions, Music, and Game & Network Services platform monetization segments. Revenue slightly topped forecasts company-wide, Hickey noted.\n\nIndependent of the analyst action, Sony reported blowout earnings for its December-ending quarter, Q3 FY2025. According to the report, operating profit rose about 22% year on year to ¥515 billion. Net income also grew 11% to ¥377.3 billion, and revenue was ¥3.71 trillion, up around 1% year on year and slightly above forecasts.\n\nManagement stated that the company’s earnings beat across core segments came on the back of growth in software and digital services, and higher image sensor sales. The Music division also contributed immensely; witnessing higher recorded music and streaming revenues. On the contrary, the Sony Pictures Entertainment division saw revenue and operating income decline in the quarter.\n\nIn light of the results, management now expects revenue of about ¥12.30 trillion and operating profit of about ¥1.54 trillion, both above its previous forecasts. It also lifted annual net profit guidance to around ¥1.13 trillion.\n\nSony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is a Japanese multinational conglomerate. It is engaged in electronics, gaming, entertainment, and financial services. Its operations span consumer electronics, PlayStation gaming consoles, music, film production, and imaging technologies.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of SONY as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) has been in red-hot form on the stock market in recent months, with shares of the memory specialist jumping by an incredible 222% in the last six months alone.\n\nInvestors have been piling into Micron stock to capitalize on the supply-constrained memory market, where demand for both compute and storage chips is skyrocketing to support artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the cloud. There is a strong possibility that Micron's red-hot run will continue, especially given that the memory shortage is expected to persist until at least 2028, according to industry watchers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nBut what if I told you there's another memory industry participant growing faster than Micron and trading at an almost identical valuation? Let's take a closer look at this name and check why it may turn out to be a better AI stock to buy.\n\nSandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) stock has jumped by an eye-popping 1,220% in the past six months, significantly outpacing Micron's terrific gains. Sandisk's outperformance can be justified by the larger earnings jumps the company has seen in recent quarters.\n\nWhile Micron reported a year-over-year increase of 167% in its non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on Nov. 27, 2025), Sandisk's adjusted earnings shot up by 404% in the fiscal second quarter that ended on Jan. 2, 2026. What's more, analysts expect a 13-fold increase in Sandisk's earnings in the current fiscal year, significantly higher than the fourfold earnings increase that Micron is estimated to deliver.\n\nYou may be wondering why Sandisk is growing much faster than Micron, even though both companies operate in the same industry. While Micron is predominantly a manufacturer of compute-oriented dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips that temporarily store information needed for processing at a given time, Sandisk manufactures non-volatile flash storage chips that store data without requiring a power source.\n\nMicron got nearly 80% of its revenue from the DRAM segment in the previous quarter, while Sandisk is a pure-play flash storage company. This is precisely why Sandisk is outpacing Micron, as NAND flash storage prices are increasing much faster than DRAM prices. Market research firm TrendForce estimates that DRAM prices could rise by 50% to 55% in the current quarter, while the prices of the solid-state drives (SSDs) that Sandisk manufactures are increasing by well into the triple digits, as reported by Tom's Hardware.\n\nWith the SSD shortage expected to continue into next year, Sandisk is likely to continue enjoying healthy earnings growth.\n\nMicron's and Sandisk's sales and earnings multiples are quite close to each other.\n\nThe incredible growth that Sandisk delivers makes it a better value pick over Micron. Of course, an investment in Micron stock is likely to reap rich rewards as well, but if you had to choose only one of these two AI stocks for your portfolio right now, Sandisk looks like the better candidate.",

      "Content": "Micron says AI-driven memory demand continues to outstrip supply through 2026 , with lean DRAM inventories and customers only meeting a fraction of their needs, keeping industry conditions tight.\n\nThe company is expanding capacity via node transitions and greenfield projects — notably the 1-gamma DRAM ramp, Idaho One (mid‑2027) , the Tongluo site (closing expected Q2, supply late‑2027/2028) and a new Singapore NAND fab (first wafer H2 2028) — meaning supply constraints could extend into 2028.\n\nMicron reports HBM4 is in high‑volume production with customer shipments underway, yields on track, and calendar Q1 shipments ramping earlier than previously guided, while 2026 HBM capacity is already sold out.\n\nInterested in Micron Technology, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nThese 3 Stocks Just Saw Major Insider Moves—Time to Be Bullish or Bearish?\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) executives told investors at Wolfe’s Auto, Auto Tech, and Semiconductor Conference that business conditions have strengthened since the company’s most recent earnings call, with demand continuing to outstrip supply across memory markets and tight industry conditions expected to persist beyond 2026.\n\nChief Financial Officer Mark Murphy, joined by Head of Investor Relations Satya Kumar, said Micron is seeing “significantly higher” demand than it—or the industry—can supply. Murphy added that the company is working to expand capacity through a combination of node transitions and greenfield investments, while also progressing on multi-year supply agreements with customers seeking longer-term visibility and assurance.\n\n→ Is Albemarle Setting Up for a Lithium-Fueled Rebound?\n\nMicron: Accelerating HBM Ramp Extends Growth Into 2027\n\nMurphy said demand is being driven by AI systems that require “more and better memory” as models grow larger, context windows extend, and reasoning becomes more intense. He described increasing “tokens generated” and a broader “re-architecture of memory systems” that is pushing high-performance memory deeper into system architectures.\n\nHe pointed to improving server demand trends through 2025, noting that expectations moved from single-digit growth to the “mid-teens” as AI workloads expanded and began affecting even traditional server demand. Murphy also cited rising hyperscaler capital spending, saying expectations for 2026 are “close to $800 billion,” compared with “under $200 billion” a few years ago.\n\n→ Cloudflare: Another AI-Disrupted Stock You Might Want to Buy\n\n5 Stocks Wall Street Repriced Higher Heading Into 2026\n\nWhile data center remains the primary driver, Murphy said demand is expected to proliferate to the edge over time, including smartphones and PCs, and eventually areas tied to autonomy-related activities.\n\nOn supply, Murphy said Micron’s inventories are lean—particularly in DRAM—and the company is “sweating the assets” to produce incremental bits where possible. Even so, he emphasized that supply is not meeting demand “by a substantial margin.” He referenced comments from Micron’s CEO on a prior earnings call that some key customers were only able to meet 50% to two-thirds of their demand, underscoring how widespread the shortfall is.\n\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\n\nMurphy outlined several steps underway to expand capacity over time:\n\nNode transition: The company is ramping its 1-gamma DRAM node, which Murphy said will provide supply into calendar 2026 and is expected to represent the majority of Micron’s bits in the second half of calendar 2026.\n\nIdaho One: Incremental greenfield capacity is expected to come online in “mid-2027.”\n\nTongluo, Taiwan acquisition: Micron announced an acquisition of a site in Tongluo to support DRAM production. Murphy said the transaction is expected to close in calendar Q2 and that the fab could provide supply near the end of 2027 into 2028. He also said the acquisition price disclosed in the press release was $1.8 billion and that the deal, along with tool installation and related spending, will add to capital expenditures.\n\nSingapore NAND fab: Micron broke ground on a new NAND fab in Singapore, with “first wafer out” expected in the second half of 2028.\n\nMurphy said supply additions take time, particularly for greenfield capacity. He also noted that node transitions are “less efficient than it used to be,” limiting how much incremental supply the industry can generate without building new facilities.\n\nAnother factor pressuring supply, Murphy said, is the increasing silicon intensity of high-bandwidth memory (HBM). He described a trade ratio that has historically been around 3-to-1 for HBM3 and said it increases as the industry moves to HBM4, HBM4E, and HBM5, further tightening supply.\n\nMurphy also addressed what he described as “recent inaccurate reporting” about Micron’s HBM4 position. He said Micron is in high-volume production of HBM4, has commenced customer shipments, and expects shipment volumes to ramp successfully in calendar Q1—one quarter earlier than the company had mentioned on its December earnings call.\n\nMurphy said Micron’s HBM capacity ramp is progressing and reiterated that the company has sold out its calendar year 2026 HBM supply. He added that HBM yields, including HBM4 yields, are on track, and said the HBM4 product delivers over 11 Gbps speeds. He expressed confidence in performance, quality, and reliability.\n\nAsked about HBM share, Murphy said the company previously targeted ramping share in line with its conventional DRAM share and stated that Micron achieved that. He added that HBM is now managed like other products with portfolio decisions based on customer needs, manufacturing footprint, and value.\n\nMurphy reiterated that Micron had guided to 68% gross margin and said the company’s financial outlook has improved since earnings, driven by pricing. He cautioned that at higher margin levels, incremental price increases have a smaller mathematical impact on margin expansion than they do at lower margins, but said Micron expects margins to expand from the fiscal second quarter into the third quarter.\n\nIn addition to pricing, Murphy cited strong cost performance from the 1-gamma ramp, operational execution, “very good” spend control, and improved absorption from higher volumes. He also pointed to mix as a contributor, saying Micron’s premium technology and portfolio provide flexibility to optimize toward higher-value areas over time.\n\nOn NAND, Murphy said the business remains important and described how the industry had “ample supply” from late 2022 onward, prompting Micron to reduce utilization and slow node migrations to restore supply-demand balance. Over that period, he said Micron sharpened its NAND portfolio, brought controller capability in-house, and extended process technology leadership.\n\nMurphy said Micron now holds a “preeminent position” in NAND, focused on the data center SSD market, spanning performance TLC SSDs and capacity-oriented QLC drives. He said Micron has gained share and noted that the company discussed achieving “over a billion-dollar run rate again” in NAND during the prior quarter.\n\nMurphy described tighter NAND market conditions as storage becomes a more important part of AI system architecture. He outlined a “hot, warm, cold” tiering approach, with HBM serving the hottest data, LPDRAM supporting warm data, and drives serving cooler data, including growing key-value (KV) cache offload needs. He said this dynamic contributed to Micron’s decision to add greenfield NAND capacity in Singapore, with output expected in 2028, while supply needs before then will be met through node transitions, including a G9 transition.\n\nKumar added that Micron published a white paper on LPDDR, describing systems expected to ship this year with triple the LPDDR content compared with last year, and asserting that additional LPDDR content can reduce time to first token by 98% and significantly improve inference.\n\nMurphy closed by emphasizing that Micron will continue investing in a “disciplined way,” reassessing market conditions and competitive capacity additions, while working to expand supply and secure longer-term agreements with customers seeking supply assurance over multi-year horizons.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc is a global semiconductor company that designs and manufactures memory and storage solutions. Its product portfolio includes dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), NAND flash memory, solid-state drives (SSDs), memory modules and embedded memory solutions for a wide range of computing and electronic devices. Micron supplies components used in data centers, enterprise and cloud infrastructure, client computing, mobile devices, automotive systems and industrial applications, and also markets consumer-facing products under the Crucial brand.\n\nFounded in 1978 and headquartered in Boise, Idaho, Micron has grown into an international manufacturer with research, development and production facilities across multiple regions.\n\nThe article \" Micron Technology Says AI Memory Demand Still Outstrips Supply Through 2026, HBM4 Shipping Early \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "By Dawn Chmielewski\n\nLOS ANGELES, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Laid-off and sidelined by last year's production slowdown, Hollywood visual‑effects veteran Michael Eng discovered a gap in his resume while perusing job listings in Los Angeles -- experience in machine learning.\n\nEng turned to Curious Refuge, an online school teaching filmmaking powered by artificial intelligence , in a bid to reinvent his career amid the industry’s rapid technological shift.\n\nLaunched in May 2023, ‌Curious Refuge's well-regarded AI film academy has become a training ground for Hollywood workers racing to adapt as generative technology reshapes production, fueling new career paths even at a time when some in the industry ‌fear losing their jobs to AI.\n\n“I kind of just embraced it,” Eng said of diving into AI tools after he was sidelined. “I jumped in.”\n\nMany in Hollywood remain wary of artificial intelligence, with critics pointing to last year’s debut of the AI‑generated actress Tilly Norwood -- condemned by the SAG‑AFTRA actors union ​as replacing human performers with “synthetics” -- as a prime example of the industry’s unease.\n\nAI SKILLS SCHOOL DRAWS 10,000 STUDENTS\n\nEng is one of 10,000 students who have attended Curious Refuge's courses or workshops, looking to update their skills, the school says. Co-founders Caleb and Shelby Ward say 95% of the current students are entertainment or advertising industry professionals looking for new skills as artificial intelligence gains a foothold in Hollywood.\n\nOthers, like Petra Molnar, are hobbyists who have been able to harness AI to find new careers.\n\nMolnar said she saw herself as a creative person but was unable to gain entry into art school in her native Budapest. She was working as a dental hygienist in London when the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered her dental office. She used the time to ‌explore her creative side, enrolling in classes -- initially studying digital product design and building ⁠her own dental app.\n\nThe rise of AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and image generators like Midjourney led her to Curious Refuge, where she began taking courses in 2023.\n\nShe has found a new career in advertising, using AI to create promotional videos, including one for AI infrastructure company WhiteFiber that was shown on the Nasdaq's seven-story-tall LED video screen in Times Square when the ⁠company went public in September.\n\n\"AI genuinely changed my life,\" Molnar said.\n\nONLINE AI TRAINING STARTUP BECOMES GLOBAL HUB\n\nFounded in 2020, Curious Refuge began offering courses in AI-assisted documentary and narrative filmmaking and in advertising in early 2023. It now provides instruction in 11 different languages to students in 170 countries. Other educators, such as the Los Angeles Film School, offer an online bachelor's degree in digital filmmaking, and major film schools also are incorporating generative AI into their curriculums.\n\nThe Curious Refuge classes are pre-recorded and made available behind an online paywall, ​allowing ​students to learn at their own pace.\n\nInstructors hold weekly office hours to answer questions, and the school hosts regular meet-ups, including at ​the Cannes Film Festival and in major cities around the world. Meanwhile, the Discord platform, which ‌is popular with gamers and programmers, has become a virtual place for the Curious Refuge community to gather.\n\nCurious Refuge also has provided AI training and workshops at studios, which its founders could not identify because of non-disclosure agreements.\n\n“We love to step in and create a baseline of understanding for the entire studio,” said Curious Refuge CEO and co-founder Caleb Ward. “Here's what's possible with artificial intelligence. Here are the creative possibilities. Here are just different takeaways that you can get from utilizing the technology.”\n\nAI SHIFTS JOBS AS HOLLYWOOD SEEKS NEW SKILLS\n\nOne 2024 study commissioned by the Concept Art Association and the Animation Guild predicted that nearly 120,000 jobs in film, television and animation would be consolidated, replaced or eliminated by the end of this year because of generative AI.\n\nSome see parallels between the rise of generative AI and the debut of YouTube, which ushered in a new generation of storytellers.\n\n\"There will be some job loss and job displacement, but there will also be job ‌creation and a generation of new storytellers that emerge, in part, because financial barriers are being reduced or they simply now have access ​to make things that were not otherwise even available to them,\" said Chris Jacquemin, head of digital strategy for the WME talent agency.\n\n\"I think ​Curious Refuge plays a critical role as a program that specializes in training filmmakers and storytellers how they ​can use the array of machine learning tools to their benefit,\" Jacquemin said.\n\nAI entertainment studio Promise, a well-regarded startup that is backed by media veteran Peter Chernin’s North Road studio and Andreessen Horowitz, ‌acquired Curious Refuge last February.\n\nThe school serves as a talent pipeline for Promise as it ​seeks artists, directors and other creatives versed in AI production techniques. ​It would be a valuable asset, as the rest of Hollywood wakes up to the potential of generative AI and competition for talent heats up.\n\n“We realized that there would be other studios like ours -- but also, many of the traditional studios and distributors and production companies -- would be looking to hire the same talent,” said Promise co-founder and President Jamie Byrne. “So we thought a lot about how we make sure that we have ​the right pipeline of talent into the company.”\n\nDeepening the AI talent pool also will ‌help speed Hollywood's adoption, Byrne said.\n\nYves Bergquist, director of the project on AI and Neuroscience at USC's Entertainment Technology Center, called education \"the single biggest opportunity in AI right now\" because the technology is highly ​complex and fast-moving. He hailed Curious Refuge's course offerings as \"first-rate.\"\n\nFor visual-effects artist Eng, Curious Refuge has already opened doors.\n\n“I immediately jumped into the tools and started getting work immediately,” said Eng, who also ​is teaching an AI filmmaking class with Studio Arts, a Los Angeles trade school.\n\n(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski; Editing by Howard Goller)",

      "Content": "Microchip says the distribution channel is largely normalized with bookings strengthening (book-to-bill substantially above 1) and a March-quarter revenue outlook of +6.2%—better than typical seasonality—though end-demand visibility remains limited.\n\nThe company guided to a 61% gross margin for the March quarter, flagged internal underutilization as a ~$50–51M headwind, and reiterated a gradual path to a long-term 65% target after recovering roughly 1,000 basis points from a ~52% low.\n\nCapital allocation has shifted to deleveraging : Microchip completed a $1.5B mandatory convertible, cut net debt/EBITDA to 4.18x from 4.69x, aims for ~1.5x (anything sub-2x), will keep the dividend, and is unlikely to resume buybacks near-term.\n\nInterested in Microchip Technology Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nMicrochip Technology Says the Slump Is Ending—The Stock Is Starting to Agree\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) executives said the company is seeing signs of strengthening demand and a more normalized channel environment, while reiterating that near-term financial priorities have shifted toward debt reduction following the recent downturn.\n\nMatthias Kaestner, corporate vice president of Auto, Data Center, and Networking at Microchip, said the most significant change in the December quarter was that the distribution channel “largely normalized.” He noted that the sell-through versus sell-in gap narrowed substantially and was down to about $12 million for the quarter, which management views as evidence the channel has “largely corrected.”\n\n→ Is Albemarle Setting Up for a Lithium-Fueled Rebound?\n\nWhy These 3 Automotive & Industrial Chip Stocks Just Soared\n\nKaestner said bookings activity strengthened during the December quarter, with a book-to-bill “substantially above 1.” He also cited an acceleration in expedite requests over the past couple of quarters, indicating continued momentum into the March quarter in line with the company’s guidance.\n\nWhile Microchip said it is seeing conditions normalize, Kaestner cautioned that visibility into true end demand remains limited given a customer base of roughly 10,000 and significant exposure to distribution. He said some customers are buying “to consumption” in certain products, while others are still working through inventory in select areas, though he characterized those pockets as not representing the majority.\n\n→ Cloudflare: Another AI-Disrupted Stock You Might Want to Buy\n\nAI Demand Is Coming—Is Microchip Technology Ready?\n\nIn response to questions about “better-than-seasonal” growth, Microchip pointed to its March-quarter outlook of 6.2% growth, which Kaestner said compares with a typical seasonal pattern of 2% to 3% growth in the March quarter. He added that the company’s best visibility remains about one quarter out, and while momentum is improving, the company was not making additional forecasts beyond March other than expecting the recovery to continue if current trends persist.\n\nOn supply dynamics, Kaestner said Microchip still has about 200 days of inventory and does not face issues on wafers produced in its internal fabs, where it maintains short lead times in most cases. Lead time extension, he said, is primarily tied to the most advanced external foundry nodes “all the way to 3 nanometers,” as well as certain assembly-related inputs such as substrates and OSAT-supplied components.\n\n→ Cisco Systems Below $82? Buy Now, It Won’t Last—$182 Is Coming\n\nMicrochip executives discussed manufacturing mix and how it affects profitability. Kaestner said the company’s footprint is roughly 37% to 40% internal manufacturing and about 60% external. Products made on 110-nanometer and larger nodes are mostly internal, while 90-nanometer and below is largely external.\n\nHe said current momentum in aerospace and defense, networking, and data center is tied to “richer mix” and higher-margin products that are predominantly produced at outside foundries. Meanwhile, Microchip reported internal underutilization as “the only headwind to gross margins today after the March quarter,” quantified at about $50 million to $51 million.\n\nMicrochip’s March-quarter gross margin guidance calls for 61%. Executives noted that the March-quarter improvement includes the elimination of inventory reserve charges. Kaestner added that previously written-off inventory could provide additional benefit if it sells through, but emphasized that the magnitude and timing are not predictable.\n\nManagement reiterated confidence in achieving a long-term 65% gross margin target, but said the timeline is gradual and likely extends through this calendar year into next year. Kaestner referenced Microchip’s “nine-point recovery plan” and said the company has already recovered roughly 1,000 basis points from a gross margin low around 52%.\n\nExecutives described data center as one of Microchip’s larger segments and said it has increased in share of the company’s revenue portfolio over the past year, while automotive declined somewhat but is “coming back.” Microchip reported compute and data center represented roughly 19% of the prior fiscal year’s revenue, and management said additional end-market color is expected in the next quarter as the company updates its annual end-market rollup.\n\nKaestner outlined three main pillars of Microchip’s data center business:\n\nPCI Express switching and retimers: Microchip supports PCIe generations 3 through 6. Kaestner said the company has introduced a Gen 6 PCIe switch built on 3-nanometer technology, which he said offers a power advantage and is generating customer interest.\n\nFlash controllers and software stack: Microchip provides controllers for large flash storage systems along with a “complete software stack,” which Kaestner described as complex and gaining traction as speeds increase generation to generation.\n\nHDD controllers: Kaestner said hard disk drives remain relevant due to cost-effective storage and are expected to have a long lifetime, with hyperscalers continuing to use HDDs for certain content where maximum access speeds aren’t required.\n\nHe also cited feature development such as security enhancements and Post-Quantum Cryptography as areas being embedded into products to help data center deployments be “future-proof.”\n\nDiscussing PCIe, Kaestner said it remains a standard interface used across server processors and GPUs, and that the pace of PCIe generation cycles has compressed from roughly three to four years to about 18 to 24 months. He said Microchip increased development efforts to stay at the forefront of those cycles and that deployments can span both scale-up and scale-out architectures depending on customer designs.\n\nIn automotive, Kaestner said Microchip’s presence extends beyond microcontrollers into areas such as touch controllers, car access systems (including key fobs and hands-free entry), and in-vehicle networking products spanning LIN, CAN, MOST, and early automotive Ethernet. He described a trend toward consolidating numerous in-vehicle communication standards into Ethernet-based systems and said Microchip is positioned with automotive switches and transceivers ranging from 10BASE-T1S to gigabit speeds.\n\nKaestner also highlighted PCIe as an emerging automotive connectivity pillar, describing automotive PCIe switches derived from the company’s PCIe Gen 4 data center switch design and adapted with automotive safety and security features and fewer lanes to reduce cost. Additionally, he discussed an acquisition completed in April of the prior year related to camera-to-compute and compute-to-display connectivity and said Microchip is involved in the Automotive SerDes Alliance (ASA) alongside OEMs including BMW, with products in market and proof-of-concept activity underway.\n\nOn China, executives said the market remains volatile but characterized many Chinese customers as pragmatic and willing to buy U.S. semiconductor products if price and features align. They noted stronger competitive pressure at the low end (microcontrollers and some analog), while citing continued design momentum in automotive for complex features that local competitors do not yet offer. Management said a “high single digit” portion of Microchip revenue stays within China and is not re-exported, and described restrictions affecting some advanced products tied to certain infrastructure-related entities, but said the impact to Microchip has not been dramatic.\n\nFinally, Investor Relations executive Sajid Daudi said Microchip’s near-term financial focus has shifted toward reducing debt after the downturn drove EBITDA lower and pushed net debt-to-EBITDA higher. He said the company completed a $1.5 billion mandatory convertible offering to address leverage concerns. Daudi said net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.18x last quarter, down from 4.69x, and reiterated a longer-term target discussed previously of 1.5x, noting “anything sub-2” remains the direction of travel.\n\nDaudi said Microchip’s dividend remains intact, but indicated buybacks are unlikely in the near term as the company prioritizes deleveraging. He added that the most recent quarter was the first in several quarters where cash flow covered the dividend, rather than requiring borrowing.\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc is a semiconductor company headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, that designs, develops and supplies a broad portfolio of embedded control and analog semiconductors. Its product lineup centers on microcontrollers (including the well-known PIC family), digital signal controllers and associated development tools and software, along with a range of mixed-signal and analog devices, nonvolatile memory, power management, timing, interface, wireless and security products. The company also provides integrated hardware and software solutions intended to simplify embedded design and accelerate time to market for OEMs and contract manufacturers.\n\nMicrochip's products are used across a wide range of end markets, including automotive, industrial automation, consumer electronics, communications, aerospace and defense, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\n\nThe article \" Microchip Technology Sees Demand Strengthen as Channel Normalizes, Shifts Focus to Debt Paydown \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) has been one of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry's biggest growth stories over the past year. The company launched its initial public offering in late March and saw its stock soar more than 300% in the months that followed -- the stock has pared gains, but it's still up nearly 140% since its market debut.\n\nThere are many things to like about CoreWeave. The company, which rents out access to AI chips, has seen revenue soar quarter after quarter. Nvidia , the world's top chip designer, is an investor in the company. And CoreWeave is well-positioned to benefit from the next stages of AI development.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nSo, if you're a growth investor, you may want to get in on this stock. But how should you time your investment? Should you rush to buy the shares before a key event on Feb. 26? Let's find out.\n\nBefore deciding, though, it's a good idea to take a closer look at the CoreWeave path so far. CoreWeave has been popular with AI customers because it offers them something they desperately need right now: capacity for their workloads. CoreWeave has invested in a fleet of Nvidia's top graphics processing units (GPUs), and customers may rent these powerful tools by the hour -- so they can use this compute briefly or for a long period of time.\n\nCustomers clearly love this solution as it means they don't have to go the expensive and time-consuming route of investing in their own GPUs. And it also offers them a great deal of flexibility. All of this has resulted in mind-boggling revenue growth for CoreWeave -- it's climbed in the triple digits in each of the past three quarters.\n\nCoreWeave also has attracted customers because it's been the first to make Nvidia's latest systems -- from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra -- fully available. Demand is high for Nvidia GPUs, often surpassing supply, so gaining access early on is a big plus. And we may count on this moving forward, considering the close relationship CoreWeave has developed with the chip giant.\n\nAs mentioned, Nvidia holds CoreWeave shares and also has pledged to buy any unused CoreWeave cloud capacity through April of 2032. So it's fair to say that Nvidia has faith in the company -- and Nvidia, given its visibility on what's to come in the AI market, is well positioned to recognize a potential winner.\n\nOf course, the one major challenge CoreWeave faces is that, to meet demand for its services, it must invest heavily in infrastructure. And that means taking on more and more debt. This represents a risk, especially considering CoreWeave already is highly leveraged.\n\nThis means CoreWeave isn't the best investment for a cautious investor. But growth investors who accept some risk might consider picking up a few shares of this company as it could continue to win big as the AI boom marches on.\n\nNow let's consider the timing of a potential investment. CoreWeave is set to report earnings on Feb. 26 after the market closes. This is well after the earnings reports of many other AI companies, from chip designer Advanced Micro Devices to cloud leader Amazon . And these major players in the AI space each have spoken of soaring demand for AI capacity. Amazon even said it plans $200 billion in capital spending this year, with a focus on its cloud computing arm.\n\nSo there's reason to be optimistic about CoreWeave's upcoming report. That said, a positive earnings report may not immediately drive the stock price higher. In recent weeks, investors have worried about the valuations of certain AI stocks, so they have become more cautious about the sector. For example, AMD and Amazon both saw their stock prices fall in the trading session following their reports.\n\nWhat's an investor to do? Avoid trying to time the market and instead buy a stock when it looks reasonably priced -- and when you're confident about the company's prospects. What I like about this strategy is that it means you don't have to worry about near-term price movement. And if you calculate any particular stock's performance over five or 10 years, it's rare to see a short-term movement truly make a difference in that long-term performance. All of this means that, for growth investors, CoreWeave is a solid stock to buy -- now or after Feb. 26.",

This leads to some huge investment opportunities in the AI sphere, and there are plenty of ways to profit from this trend.\n\nI've got five AI stocks that look like great buys in February, and investors should be racing to load up on them before the market sends them far higher.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nThere are several huge beneficiaries of all of this AI spending, but Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are at the top of the list. Both companies make computing equipment that is heavily used in AI data centers , and with the huge amount of spending occurring in that area, they will see strong growth as a result.\n\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the industry standard for AI computing. Nvidia's entire technology stack outperforms any other option available, making it the go-to vendor in this segment.\n\nBroadcom is partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to design custom AI chips that are tailored to the workflows they will see.\n\nBoth Nvidia's GPUs and Broadcom's custom chips have their specific use cases in AI, and each will continue to be a part of the computing muscle that powers AI workloads. With each company being a major beneficiary of the spending by the AI hyperscalers, they're set to perform quite well over the next few years.\n\nAnother beneficiary of this spending is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . Taiwan Semiconductor fabricates most of the logic chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, but it's also the supplier for many other key tech companies. Without TSMC's foundry capabilities, none of the AI technology we see today would be possible. Furthermore, the rising tide of AI spending lifts all boats, and with TSMC being a chip supplier to nearly every major AI component out there, it's slated to do quite well during the next few years.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC's new 2-nanometer chip technology promises reduced power consumption, which helps alleviate the energy crisis as all these AI data centers start coming online. As long as there is AI spending, Taiwan Semiconductor will continue to be a top option in the space.\n\nBoth Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) saw their shares fall in reaction to their latest earnings results. However, sell-offs of these stocks aren't really warranted. Each is a key player in the cloud computing industry, which is why they are spending so much to build out their AI footprints.\n\nAlthough equipment providers like Nvidia and Broadcom may have a more difficult time selling their hardware once an adequate amount of AI computing capacity has been built, the cloud computing providers will have a near-endless stream of demand and revenue. By renting out their computing capacity to others, they can profit from several generative AI companies creating huge, new businesses in the AI gold rush. However, instead of having to spend money putting up new data centers, they can maintain their old ones, which is far cheaper.\n\nFurthermore, both cloud computing providers are seeing soaring demand, which shows that AI capital investment spending is warranted. Microsoft Azure revenue rose 39% during its latest quarter, while Google Cloud blew away all expectations and revenue rose 48%. The reality is, the growth rates justify all this spending, and Alphabet and Microsoft are two of the best in the tech universe.\n\nI think the recent price pullbacks are a gift to investors, and each can make for a great cornerstone investment in your portfolio.",

The median target price of $250 per share implies 33% upside from the current share price of $187.\n\nOn that note, investors just got some good news from Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft that hints at strong financial results from Nvidia in the year ahead.

The company holds more than 80% market share in AI accelerators, and many analysts think Nvidia will maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy, meaning the company develops adjacent hardware and software.\n\nTo elaborate, while Nvidia GPUs consistently outperform competing chips, the company is truly formidable because it offers a turnkey solution for AI infrastructure comprising CPUs, networking , and software tools. Indeed, networking revenue increased 162% in the most recent quarter, and its proprietary CUDA software is the industry standard in developing GPU-accelerated applications.\n\nSo what? Nvidia captures a substantial percentage of data center capital expenditures (capex) due to its full-stack strategy -- AllianceBernstein estimates the company pockets 30% of total AI data center spending as profit. And recent projections from several hyperscalers (i.e., companies with massive data center footprints) indicate that Wall Street woefully underestimated how much money will be spent on AI infrastructure this year.\n\nWall Street analysts have consistently underestimated AI spending in recent years. The consensus forecast said AI hyperscaler capex would increase 19% in 2024, but it actually soared 54%. Similarly, the consensus forecast said AI hyperscaler capex would increase 22% in 2025, but it actually soared 64%, according to Goldman Sachs .\n\nThat pattern is repeating in 2026. While the consensus estimate said AI hyperscaler capex would jump 19% this year, recent commentary from Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft suggests much faster growth.\n\nAlphabet says capex will total $180 billion at the midpoint in 2026, up 98% from $91 billion in 2025. Also, it's worth noting that Alphabet initially estimated $75 billion in capex last year, but exceeded that figure by a wide margin. In the fourth quarter, cloud revenue backlog more than doubled on strong demand for Gemini models and platform services.\n\nAmazon says capex will total $200 billion in 2026, up 56% from $128 billion in 2025. Most of that total will be directed at AI infrastructure in the cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services (AWS). \"Customers really want AWS for core and AI workloads,\" said CEO Andy Jassy. \"We're monetizing capacity as fast as we can install it.\"\n\nMeta Platforms says capex will total $125 billion at the midpoint in 2026, up 74% from $72 billion in 2025. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI investments are driving meaningful growth across its social media platforms and ad business. Also, in the not too distant future, Meta hopes to develop a superintelligence system that can be integrated into wearables like augmented reality glasses.\n\nMicrosoft says capex totaled $72 billion in the first two quarters of fiscal 2026, which ended in December, putting the company on pace to spend more than $140 billion in the fiscal year. That represents a 59% increase from $88 billion in fiscal 2025. CEO Satya Nadella said, \"We will increase our AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double our total data center footprint over the next two years.\"\n\nHere's the big picture: Wall Street initially estimated AI hyperscaler capex would increase 19% in 2026, but revised estimates suggest spending will increase 70% to roughly $650 billion. That is good news for Nvidia because the company is likely to capture a large percentage of that spending.",

Also, in the not too distant future, Meta hopes to develop a superintelligence system that can be integrated into wearables like augmented reality glasses.\n\nMicrosoft says capex totaled $72 billion in the first two quarters of fiscal 2026, which ended in December, putting the company on pace to spend more than $140 billion in the fiscal year. That represents a 59% increase from $88 billion in fiscal 2025. CEO Satya Nadella said, \"We will increase our AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double our total data center footprint over the next two years.\"\n\nHere's the big picture: Wall Street initially estimated AI hyperscaler capex would increase 19% in 2026, but revised estimates suggest spending will increase 70% to roughly $650 billion. That is good news for Nvidia because the company is likely to capture a large percentage of that spending.",

      "Content": "Investing.com -- Tesla’s plan to develop 100 gigawatts of solar manufacturing capacity reflects a long-term strategic view shaped by geopolitics, supply chain risks, and rising power needs from next-generation data centers, according to Morgan Stanley in a note this week.\n\n“We believe TSLA’s decision to allocate capital to solar mfg is rooted in a strategic long-term outlook around evolving geopolitics and data center demand,” wrote analyst Andrew Percoco.\n\nHe told clients that deeper vertical integration could also strengthen the company’s energy business.\n\nMorgan Stanley believes Tesla’s solar ambitions could add “$25–$50bn ($6–$14/shr) of equity value” to its Tesla Energy valuation, which the bank currently places at $140 billion.\n\nOnce scaled, Tesla Solar could generate “$25bn of revenue and $3–$4bn of additional EBIT,” the note added.\n\nThe 100 GW build-out would be costly, potentially requiring “$30–$70bn in capital investment,” and is not covered by Tesla’s capital expenditure guidance for 2026.\n\nBut Morgan Stanley argued the long-term benefits may justify the investment, especially given the strategic link to Tesla’s energy storage business.\n\nCritically, Percoco said the bank believes “a significant portion of the 100 GW capacity will be used for data centers in space,” with a smaller share going to facilities on earth.\n\nThis aligns, the note said, with Elon Musk’s goal “to send a significant amount of solar-powered data centers into space,” avoiding energy bottlenecks that could hinder Tesla’s broader ambitions.\n\nWhile the global solar market is currently in surplus, Morgan Stanley expects Tesla’s new capacity to be dedicated largely to these specialised applications, insulating it from traditional supply-demand dynamics.",

      "Content": "Stock investing entails different strategies, but the goal remains simple. For instance, whether you pursue growth or dividend-paying stocks , you hope to make money. Of course, you have to take your risk tolerance into account.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has made investors a lot of money over the years, but its recent performance has been lackluster. Over the last year, which ended on Feb. 5, the stock lost 8.2% compared to the S&P 500 's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 16.5% return.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nCan the shares reverse course, making this a good long-term investment?\n\nAmazon has three segments: North America, international, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The first two include a wide range of activities, like online selling, physical stores, devices (e.g., Echo), and advertising.\n\nThe North America and international segments produce the majority of the company's sales. They accounted for 82% of Amazon's $716.9 billion sales in 2025. However, they had $34.7 billion in operating income, or 43% of the total.\n\nThese businesses are doing fine, growing sales and profit year over year. However, AWS, its cloud-computing business, remains Amazon's largest profit generator. The business grew operating income 14.5% to $45.6 billion.\n\nWith organizations clamoring for data and the large resources needed to build and maintain data centers, AWS has a competitive advantage. In fact, the business has the leading market share, 30% as of mid-2025, compared to 20% for Microsoft 's Azure and 13% for Alphabet 's Google Cloud.\n\nWith the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the business' growth could accelerate.\n\nDespite strong sales and profit growth, investors sent the stock down following the company's fourth-quarter earnings release on Feb. 5. That's because management outlined plans to boost capital expenditures to $200 billion this year.\n\nThat's significantly higher than 2025's $131.8 billion. And Amazon will outspend its operating cash flow unless there's a marked increase from the $139.5 billion generated last year.\n\nHowever, this shouldn't concern long-term investors. Management believes this will produce a significant return on capital, which would benefit shareholders. After all, Amazon has unique opportunities, including building data centers to meet AI demand.\n\nWith the shares trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28, down from 40 a year ago, the valuation has become more attractive. Over 10 years, Amazon has a median P/E multiple of 82. It also has a better valuation than the S&P 500, which has a P/E ratio of 30.\n\nOf course, the question is, will you be better off investing in Amazon or an index fund, such as one replicating the S&P 500 ? While short-term stock price movements are difficult to predict, I believe investors have the opportunity to make more by purchasing Amazon's stock based on its valuation and growth prospects.",

The company released plug-ins last week to make it more helpful to users in the legal, sales, finance, data, marketing, and customer support fields.\n\nFears that these tools could upend traditional software and digital automation providers spooked investors, sending legacy software and software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks into a tailspin, and the rout is ongoing. The S&P North American Technology Software Index , which includes more than 100 software stocks, has fallen into bear market territory, plunging more than 30% from its peak in early September.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile some investors believe the sky is falling, many experts disagree. At an event last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, \"There's this notion that the software industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI. It is the most illogical thing in the world.\"\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives, a veteran in the tech sector, also believes the selling is overdone, arguing that enterprises are unlikely to abandon software and infrastructure they've invested decades in, particularly for unproven or risky technology. This creates a buying opportunity for some of technology's most highly regarded stocks. Let's take a look at five.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was instrumental in sparking the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The software and cloud computing giant invested heavily in ChatGPT parent OpenAI and quickly developed a suite of AI-powered Copilots to help streamline business produces and boost productivity. Microsoft went further, integrating AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its products and services.\n\nThe company is a trusted name among enterprise users, who are unlikely to risk their futures on unproven technologies. Its Azure Cloud and AI solutions are experiencing robust adoption as \"demand continues to exceed supply,\" according to CFO Amy Hood.\n\nMicrosoft stock has fallen 25% from its peak (as of this writing) and is selling for 25 times earnings. Ives has an outperform (buy) rating and a $575 price target on Microsoft stock, implying potential upside of 42% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) is a leading cloud-native cybersecurity specialist that has AI in its DNA. The company is on the leading edge, securing enterprise platforms and systems from attacks by AI-powered adversaries. That's why it makes so little sense that the stock has fallen along with the broader software space.\n\nThe company is AI agnostic, and its Charlotte platform is the gold standard for securing domains, endpoints, and identities. Furthermore, CrowdStrike's Falcon AI Detection and Response protects from attacks against generative AI tools and systems -- and the need has never been greater.\n\nCrowdStrike has fallen 25% from its peak and is trading for 22 times sales. Ives has an outperform (buy) rating and a $600 price target on the stock, implying potential upside of 44% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nCloud data management specialist Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) provides an AI-centric platform that sifts through mounds of data in a threat-free environment, providing actionable insights to help companies improve decision-making, increase productivity, and better serve their customers.\n\nThe company's state-of-the-art analytics tools and data warehousing solutions provide a platform where AI workflows meet proprietary and sensitive enterprise information. The need for its services will increase with the adoption of AI, not the other way around, as it provides the security and controls to protect company data. This will hardly be disrupted by improvements in AI, but rather benefit from it.\n\nSnowflake has fallen 35% from its peak and is selling for 13 times sales. Ives has an outperform (buy) rating and a $270 price target on the stock, implying potential upside of 51% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nSalesforce (NYSE: CRM) pioneered customer relationship management (CRM) solutions and adopted AI long before it was fashionable. As such, the company has amassed decades' worth of data, which serves as a powerful moat. The company has already introduced its Agentforce suite of AI agents. These, in turn, help streamline service, sales, and marketing tasks.\n\nFurthermore, its Data 360 compiles data from disparate sources and provides AI-driven insight without moving the data. In all, the company offers a vast ecosystem of tools and solutions that have been decades in the making.\n\nSalesforce has fallen 44% from its peak and is selling for 25 times earnings. Ives has an outperform (buy) rating and a $375 price target on the stock, implying potential upside of 103% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is one of the most controversial stocks on the market today. It's an undisputed leader in providing data mining and AI solutions to government and enterprise customers alike, and in many ways, its battle-tested solutions are without equal.\n\nThe company developed its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which aggregates company data to provide real-time solutions to everyday business problems. Unprecedented demand for AIP continues, as it delivers proven return on investment (ROI) for businesses. When it comes to mission-critical use cases, Palantir has virtually no competition.\n\nThe stock has fallen 36% from its peak, mainly due to its egregious valuation, trading at 210 times earnings. Ives has an outperform (buy) rating and a $230 price target on Palantir stock, implying upside potential of 70% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nIves argues that investors who focus solely on current valuations miss the boat on innovative, game-changing stocks like Palantir. He goes further, suggesting Palantir is on its way to \"becoming a trillion-dollar market cap company,\" suggesting longer-term upside of 209%.",

      "Content": "Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) faced considerable challenges for most of the last five years. The release of GPT-4 appeared to catch the company off guard. For the first time in decades, investors began to doubt the dominance of Google Search as more users turned to artificial intelligence-driven search tools.\n\nFortunately, Alphabet has reasserted its dominance, and in the minds of some, it now has the leading AI tool. For this reason, its five-year performance far surpasses the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) . Moreover, it will likely beat the market over the next five years. Here's why.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nAlphabet stock is back in growth mode because it has leveraged its massive cash hoard and existing intellectual property to make a comeback in AI.\n\nAdmittedly, the waning influence of Google Search had hurt the company for reasons other than competing AI tools. Google designed its search engine to direct users to websites and collected revenue from digital ads from that model. Since the AI tools often give users the desired information directly, it reduced the need for such ads.\n\nNonetheless, amid the release of Gemini 3, breakthroughs in processing and understanding multiple types of data seem to have given the company's tool a technical edge, which is probably why it is gaining attention from institutional investors .\n\nMoreover, Alphabet has long worked to reduce its dependence on digital ads, which still make up 73% of its revenue.

      "Content": "Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) faced considerable challenges for most of the last five years. The release of GPT-4 appeared to catch the company off guard. For the first time in decades, investors began to doubt the dominance of Google Search as more users turned to artificial intelligence-driven search tools.\n\nFortunately, Alphabet has reasserted its dominance, and in the minds of some, it now has the leading AI tool. For this reason, its five-year performance far surpasses the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) . Moreover, it will likely beat the market over the next five years. Here's why.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nAlphabet stock is back in growth mode because it has leveraged its massive cash hoard and existing intellectual property to make a comeback in AI.\n\nAdmittedly, the waning influence of Google Search had hurt the company for reasons other than competing AI tools. Google designed its search engine to direct users to websites and collected revenue from digital ads from that model. Since the AI tools often give users the desired information directly, it reduced the need for such ads.\n\nNonetheless, amid the release of Gemini 3, breakthroughs in processing and understanding multiple types of data seem to have given the company's tool a technical edge, which is probably why it is gaining attention from institutional investors .\n\nMoreover, Alphabet has long worked to reduce its dependence on digital ads, which still make up 73% of its revenue. To that end, Google Cloud now generates 15% of the company's revenue, up from 12% last year.\n\nAdditionally, Waymo is one of the leading autonomous driving platforms and boasts 20 million rides to date.

Davidson分析師路里亞（Gil Luria）在12日首度將台積電納入研究範圍，不僅給予買進評等外，也評論台積電是「AI周期核心的一環，能在各種情境下奪得絕大部分獲利。」路里亞透露，台積電目前正加速量產2奈米晶片，且1.6奈米製程也將在今年下半年投入量產；儘管競爭對手在技術上奮力追趕，但台積電將新架構轉化為高良率、高產能製造的能力，才是真正拉開差距的關鍵。據彭博資料顯示，目前已至少有37家機構將台積電ADR納入評等。\n台積電美股週四盤中一度觸及380美元歷史高點，終場下跌1.6%，收在368.10美元。週五股價再跌0.47%，終場報366.36美元。\n◎《FTNN新聞網》提醒您：本資料僅供參考，投資人應獨立判斷，審慎評估並自負投資風險。",

      "Content": "While Wall Street's price targets shouldn't be the only factor retail investors weigh when researching potential investments, they are great to look at for validation that you're looking in the right places. It's a red flag for me if a stock that I'm considering has poor analyst projections, as it may tell me that I haven't quite learned enough about the company to understand why others think its upside is so low.\n\nHowever, one that interests me now is a stock that Wall Street analysts believe has huge one-year growth potential: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . Anyone who follows artificial intelligence (AI) investing is likely already aware of this stock, as are many non-AI investors. It has been one of the top-performing stocks over the past few years thanks to its position in the AI landscape. With massive projected top-line growth ahead, it should come as no surprise that Nvidia's price target from the average Wall Street analyst is sky-high.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's stock trades at about $185 per share. That's about 10% below its all-time high. However, Wall Street analysts covering the company expect monster growth over the next year, with an average price target of $253.62. That indicates a one-year upside of 37%.\n\nIf you want an even more bullish projection, one analyst has a price target of $352 per share on Nvidia stock, which is slightly less than double what it is now. But are those realistic projections?\n\nSeveral AI hyperscalers have announced their 2026 capital expenditure plans for AI data centers , and the numbers are jaw-dropping. While Nvidia won't get all of this spending, it will capture a nice chunk. This supports the impressive growth projections for it this year: The Wall Street consensus is that Nvidia will report about $213 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2026, which ended late last month. Analysts further forecast that it will grow its revenue by 53% in fiscal 2027 to $326 billion. If Nvidia can maintain its 53% profit margin, that would amount to $173 billion in profits.\n\nAt a price-to-earnings ratio of 40 -- lower than it currently sports -- that would give Nvidia a market cap of $6.9 trillion, or upside of 53%. However, its actual earnings multiple at that point could be different depending on how bullish or bearish the market is on AI spending a year from now.\n\nRegardless, there's a pretty clear-cut bull case for Nvidia. In my view, it's one of the best AI stocks to buy in February.",

Taiwan Semiconductor is a $1.72 trillion company, while Broadcom tops the sales at $1.47 trillion.

Management expects huge growth from AI over the next few years, with AI chip revenue rising at nearly a 60% CAGR. However, that's not a companywide growth rate, as other companies utilize its foundry services outside of AI.

Although it does several other things, its biggest growth driver is its custom AI chips, which it designs in a partnership with AI hyperscalers. By designing a chip around a specific workload, Broadcom can achieve better results at a lower price point but at the cost of flexibility. These are massively growing in popularity, and Broadcom expects to double its AI segment revenue year over year during Q1 2026. As more hyperscalers launch their custom chip design with Broadcom, their growth rate will continue to be strong.

      "Content": "There have only been four companies to reach a $3 trillion market cap or greater. But as the stock market rises, the $3 trillion level will eventually be breached by many more companies. In fact, I think three of them will each reach that level over the next three years.\n\nThe three that I've got my eye on are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . All of these companies are within striking distance, and each looks like a worthy investment option now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nSome of these companies have further to go than others. Amazon is already a $2.4 trillion company, so projecting that it will rise to a market cap of $3 trillion in three years isn't really that bold a call. It only needs to manage a growth rate of 8% over the next three years to get there. If that's all, the faster it grows, the more likely it will be a disappointment for most investors. I think Amazon has a much better growth case than that, but we'll get to that in a bit.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom have much further to go. Taiwan Semiconductor is a $1.72 trillion company, while Broadcom tops the sales at $1.47 trillion. It will take a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% and 27%, respectively, for each to rise to a $3 trillion cap three years from now.\n\nThat's no easy task, but if each can deliver that rate of return, they will make for no-brainer buys right now. But are these growth rates feasible?\n\nAmazon is probably the easiest company to make a case for. Although it only needs to deliver an 8% growth rate to reach this level, it has managed to grow its revenue above double digits for the past four years.\n\nAMZN Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\n\nI have no doubt that it will continue that trend over the next few years, and it could grow at an even faster rate thanks to the acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing service that powers traditional and AI workloads, posted revenue growth of 24% in the fourth quarter (Q4) -- the best in 13 quarters. This is a clear sign that Amazon's business is thriving, and with AWS having a much better operating margin than the rest of the business, its outsized growth will have an even greater effect on profits. Amazon is a lock to reach a $3 trillion market cap in three years and should beat the market along the way.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key part of the AI build-out, as its chip foundries manufacture a large chunk of the logic chips utilized in AI devices. Management expects huge growth from AI over the next few years, with AI chip revenue rising at nearly a 60% CAGR. However, that's not a companywide growth rate, as other companies utilize its foundry services outside of AI. From 2024 to 2029, management expects a CAGR of nearly 25% companywide, easily surpassing the 20% return threshold needed to rise to a $3 trillion company three years from now.\n\nLast is Broadcom. It has the longest way to go but will likely grow at the fastest rate. Although it does several other things, its biggest growth driver is its custom AI chips, which it designs in a partnership with AI hyperscalers. By designing a chip around a specific workload, Broadcom can achieve better results at a lower price point but at the cost of flexibility. These are massively growing in popularity, and Broadcom expects to double its AI segment revenue year over year during Q1 2026.

      "Content": "Being a leading provider of semiconductor memory solutions, Micron Technology MU is the most searched for stock on Zacks.com outside of Nvidia NVDA .\n\nThis comes as the storied memory chip shortage has made Micron a central beneficiary of the AI hardware boom.\n\nThe rapid expansion of AI hardware — data centers, GPUs, and accelerators — is consuming most of the memory chip supply and bandwidth, driving a sharp increase in demand for Micron’s offerings.\n\nWith the demand shock being structural and not a temporary spike, Micron’s stock more than tripled last year and is already up more than 40% in 2026.\n\nWhile this is an unprecedented surge, analysts argue that Micron’s valuation remains compelling because earnings are rising even faster than the stock price.\n\nFollowing a recent pullback from an all-time high of $455 a share, the surge in Micron’s stock looks poised to continue.\n\nTo that point, Micron is still seeing an eye-catching trend of positive EPS revisions, and has held a spot on the coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list since this past August.\n\nMicron’s HBM (high-bandwidth memory), server-class DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), DDR5 (double data rate), and broader DRAM portfolio are seeing explosive demand.\n\nNotably, AI chips from Nvidia, AMD AMD , and Alphabet GOOGL require enormous amounts of HBM, making it the single most supply-constrained memory type in the world right now.\n\nDDR5 is the fifth generation of advanced synchronous DRAM and has been in short supply as well, making this category a major growth driver for Micron as the latest, fastest, and most efficient memory standard powering modern servers, PCs, and AI systems.\n\nReflecting the exceptionally favorable supply and demand dynamic, Micron’s FY25 sales hit a record $37.38 billion, with annual earnings near multi-year highs at $8.29 per share. And of course, top and bottom line peaks are projected this year.\n\nWall Street expects Micron’s EPS to spike 300% in FY26 to a record $33.22, a staggering acceleration that reflects both pricing power and volume growth. Better still, FY27 EPS is projected to climb another 35% to a whopping $44.95.\n\nSince most recently crushing earnings expectations for its fiscal first quarter in December, Micron’s FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates have continued to trend higher and are now up 78% and 91% in the last 60 days, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstonishingly, the year-ago earnings estimates picture shows that FY26 and FY27 EPS revisions have now skyrocketed 207% and 490%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nJust as captivating is that despite such an exhilarating rally, Micron stock still trades at 12X forward earnings. This is well below the rather stretched P/E premiums other high-growth tech stocks can command and offers a distinct discount to the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nMore intriguing, MU trades nicely beneath Sandisk Corporation SNDK and Western Digital’s WDC forward earnings multiples of 23X and 31X, as two of the other prime beneficiaries of the global memory chip shortage.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron has enjoyed exceptional pricing power, an advantage that strongly supports the continued momentum in its stock. Since being added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on August 20, 2025, Micron stock has soared a staggering 865% .\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Walmart WMT shares have been standout performers this year, handily outperforming not just the broader market indexes and brick-and-mortar retail peers but also Amazon AMZN and many members of the Magnificent 7 group.\n\nWith the company set to report quarterly results on Thursday, February 19th, it will be interesting to see whether the stock can maintain its momentum after the results.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart shares (green line, up +20.2%) relative to the Mag 7 group (blue line, down -5.4%), the S&P 500 index (red line, down -0.4%), Amazon (purple line, down -13.9%) and Target shares (orange line in the chart, up +18.2%). Target has also been added to the chart, though the company will be reporting quarterly results on Tuesday, March 3 rd .\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe should keep in mind, however, that the performance pecking order shifts when we move the starting point of this chart back by 12 months, as shown below. Target has enjoyed an impressive run this year, but the retailer’s one-year performance is comparable to Amazon’s.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart’s share price outperformance reflects the market’s collective optimism about the company’s large and growing digital business, which has enabled it to tap new growth opportunities such as third-party fulfillment and advertising.\n\nWalmart’s e-commerce business complements its core merchandise, which remains heavily indexed toward groceries, other essentials, and must-have necessities. This orientation towards essentials, coupled with Walmart’s well-earned reputation for low prices, provides the company’s results with a high degree of cyclical stability.\n\nWe should note, however, that a big contributing factor to Walmart’s stock market momentum over the last few years reflects its ability to gain market share among higher-income households. Driving those gains has been a combination of higher-income households trading down to Walmart in response to inflation and the ease of using the company’s e-commerce capabilities. Walmart has consistently flagged market-share gains across all income categories, particularly in the high-income category, and we expect further gains on that front in this quarterly report as well.\n\nResults likely benefited from pulled-forward demand in anticipation of tariffs, particularly in some categories like electronics. Growth in e-commerce and steadily lower losses in that business, coupled with gains from third-party fulfillment and advertising, are some of the other areas that will benefit results this quarter.\n\nThe e-commerce business in the U.S. is now profitable and will likely become a significant contributor to earnings in 2026 and beyond. E-commerce accounts for an estimated 15% of total ex-gasoline sales at present, which management sees eventually increasing to more than double that level over time.\n\nWith respect to tariffs, management noted earlier in the year that roughly two-thirds of U.S. sales were from domestically sourced products, which gave them a degree of insulation from the tariffs issue compared to others. A big part of this is Walmart’s groceries business, which accounts for almost 60% of its sales, unlike Target, where groceries are a much smaller part of the revenue mix.\n\nManagement has reiterated its commitment to maintain price advantage over rivals, a function of Walmart’s size, the nature of its supplier relationships, and the increasing automation of its logistical operations. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.73 in EPS on $189.9 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +10.6% and +5.2%, respectively. Estimates have been stable, though they have nudged up a hair since the quarter began.\n\nIn terms of same-store sales, the expectation is of U.S. comps (ex fuel) of +4.17%, which will compare to a +4.4% gain in the preceding quarter (vs. expectations of +4.02%), and a +4.9% gain in the year-earlier period (vs. expectations of +4.36%). A positive general merchandise read will also have positive read-throughs for Target.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2025 Q4 earnings season scorecard , we now have results from 13 of the 31 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 13 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have already reported Q4 results belong mostly to the e-commerce and restaurant industries, though we have several restaurant companies on deck to report this week as well.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for these 13 retailers that have reported are up +6.3% from the same period last year on +11.6% higher revenues, with 46.2% beating EPS estimates and 76.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the EPS beats percentages for these online players and restaurant operators are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. In fact, the Q4 EPS beats percentage at 46.2% matches the lowest beats percentage for this group of Retail sector companies in the preceding 20-quarter period. Unlike EPS beats, revenue beats are far more numerous and tracking above historical averages.\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 13 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q4 earnings were up +5.9% on +13.6% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart now a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s coming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player, thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThrough Friday, February 13 th , we have seen Q4 results from 371 S&P 500 members, or 74.2% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +8.8% higher revenues, with 75.5% beating EPS estimates and 72.5% beating revenue estimates.\n\nWe have more than 400 companies on deck to report results this week, including 56 index members. The week’s lineup includes a blend of operators such as Palo Alto Networks, DoorDash, Etsy, and Booking Holdings, as well as traditional bellwethers such as Toll Brothers, Deere, and others.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the growth rates for these 371 index members with what we had seen from this same group of companies in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages for this group companies relative to what we had seen from them in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison chart below puts the Q4 net margins for the 371 companies that have reported in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimates for the current period (2026 Q1) have risen modestly in recent days, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n2026 Q1 estimates have increased modestly for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the start of January, including Tech, Industrials, Retail, Utilities, and Business Services.

      "Content": "After beginning the year on a strong note, shares of e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have recently fallen off a cliff.\n\nLet's dig into why Amazon investors are running for the hills. Is now a good opportunity to buy the dip in Amazon, or is the stock turning into a falling knife ?\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nOver the last three years, Amazon has accelerated its capital expenditures (capex) significantly. Rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) is causing Amazon to invest heavily across the infrastructure value chain -- from building data centers, designing its own custom silicon, and complementing these chips with GPUs from Nvidia .\n\nAmazon reported earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2025 on Feb. 5. Prior to the report, Wall Street was expecting management to guide for around $150 billion in capex this year. With this in mind, investors had sticker shock when the company's plans for $200 billion capex were revealed.\n\nThe trends in the chart sum up why Wall Street is getting skittish over Amazon. The inverse correlation between rising infrastructure spend and decelerating cash flow generation is a major concern for investors.\n\nWhere investors may be missing the mark is looking at Amazon's revenue growth. Over the last year, sales and operating profits from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division have consistently risen. In other words, Amazon's high-margin cloud business is experiencing both accelerating sales and profit margins.\n\nThis dynamic is allowing the company to allocate capital across so many different AI-related projects. Building its own data centers and custom chips, alongside its strategic investment in Anthropic, is helping Amazon vertically integrate its AI operations.\n\nIn the long run, this should significantly reduce costs and lead to stronger earnings growth. When you think about it this way, Amazon's playbook to double down on its AI infrastructure roadmap looks savvy. While rising capex may be a near-term dent for free cash flow, the long-term gains are hard to deny.\n\nAs of this writing, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is hovering near its lowest level throughout the entire AI revolution.\n\nConsidering sales from AWS are beginning to reaccelerate and are complemented by robust profit margins, I am confident that Amazon's decision to continue investing in AI infrastructure makes sense strategically. While I understand investor concerns around execution risk, I think Amazon has already done a fine job of mitigating these worries.\n\nTo me, the sell-off in Amazon stock is overdone, and the stock looks like a no-brainer right now. Against this backdrop, I'd say Amazon isn't just a good stock to buy -- it's a great one for long-term investors to buy and hold.",

      "Content": "Applied Materials ( AMAT ) reported its Q1 earnings on February 12. The earnings beat consensus estimates for adjusted EPS and revenue, and the stock is trading 10% higher at the time of writing, Friday morning, Feb. 13, according to Yahoo Finance .\n\nThe supplier of semiconductor and semiconductor-related fabrication equipment reported revenue of $7 billion, a 2% year-over-year decline, yet the earnings report got investors excited and prompted Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya to raise his price target for Applied Materials.\n\nThe cause of excitement was CEO Gary Dickerson’s prepared remarks during the earnings call : “For Applied, we expect to grow our semiconductor equipment business more than 20% this calendar year. We see the demand profile weighted towards the second half of the calendar year, with availability of customer cleanroom space being a key factor pacing the rate of investment.”\n\nDickerson continued by making this great outlook sound even better. “Our largest customers are giving us increased longer-term visibility to ensure we have operational capacity and service support in place for their ramps,\" he added.\n\n\"Based on this visibility, we expect strong growth momentum to be carried into 2027.”\n\nTo put it all in perspective, we can look at the complete Q2 guidance versus what analysts expected. The numbers come from the Bank of America research note shared with TheStreet.\n\nMetric\n\nManagement Guidance (Q2 2026)\n\nWall Street Consensus\n\nBank of America\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n$7.65 Billion (±$500M)\n\n$7.03 Billion\n\n$6.85 billion\n\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS\n\n$2.64 (±$0.20)\n\n$2.29\n\n$2.20\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\n\n~49.3%\n\n48.5%\n\n48.4%\n\nThe great outlook makes even more sense when we consider what the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) estimates for 2026.\n\n“The global semiconductor industry posted its highest-ever annual sales in 2025, nearly hitting $800 billion, and global sales in 2026 are projected to reach roughly $1 trillion,” stated SIA CEO John Neuffer.\n\nFollowing the report’s release, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya and his team updated their view on AMAT stock.\n\nRevenue of $7.65 billion\n\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.64\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 49.3%\n\nThe team estimates the company will gain approximately 1% in 2026, thanks to cyclical growth, leadership in DRAM, advanced packaging, and deposition and conductor etch systems.\n\nAnalysts raised their non-GAAP EPS estimates for 2026 and 2027 by 18% and 24% to $11.86 and $14.57, respectively.\n\nApplied Global Services could grow at a rate higher than the typical low-double-digit pace through steady install base expansion, with all recurring revenue helping fund capital returns.\n\nApplied Materials captures more than 50% of the serviceable addressable market share in inflection points such as Gate-All-Around (GAA) and backside power delivery, where revenue opportunities increase by 30% versus FinFET .\n\nSystems' gross margins of 54% improved by 1% year over year and can expand further as Applied Materials prices to value.",

      "Content": "It has been just under a year since digital storage giant Western Digital spun off flash storage specialist Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) , and the latter has turned into one of the hottest stocks on the market since its separation.\n\nShares of the company -- which specializes in NAND flash storage solutions for smartphones, personal computers (PCs), tablets, automotive applications, wearable devices, and data centers -- have shot up a stunning 1,400% since the spin-off. Investors may now be wondering whether it is worth holding this semiconductor stock after its red-hot rally.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nLet's take a closer look at Sandisk's long-term prospects and check whether it can deliver more upside over the next three years.\n\nWe have already seen that Sandisk's storage solutions are used across multiple applications. The edge devices market, which includes PCs and smartphones, is its largest business segment, accounting for 55% of its revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on Jan. 2, 2026). Sandisk's revenue from this segment shot up by 63% from the year-ago period, to just under $1.7 billion.\n\nThe company pointed out that the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the PC and smartphone markets is a major catalyst for this segment. That's not surprising, as generative AI-capable smartphones and PCs are equipped with higher storage to support local AI tasks. Importantly, shipments of these devices are poised to accelerate at a healthy pace over the next three years.\n\nMarket research firm IDC estimates that generative AI smartphone shipments could jump to 912 million units in 2028, up from 234 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, generative AI PC shipments are predicted to jump to 138 million units in 2028, up from just over 24 million units in 2024. So, Sandisk should continue to witness healthy demand from these end markets in the long run.\n\nAt the same time, investors should note the strong growth Sandisk is witnessing in data centers, where demand for fast flash storage solutions such as solid-state drives (SSDs) is increasing. SSDs offer much faster data transfer speeds and greater energy efficiency than hard-disk drives (HDDs). Specifically, SSDs can be a hundred times faster than HDDs, enabling instant data transfer at higher bandwidths.\n\nOf course, HDDs are significantly cheaper than SSDs. However, the shortage of HDDs is pushing AI infrastructure companies toward SSDs. SSDs can also reduce the total operating costs of data centers thanks to their energy efficiency and faster data transfer rates.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see the data center business moving the needle in a bigger way for Sandisk over the next three years, especially considering the massive investments in this space . The company reported a 76% year-over-year increase in data center revenue in the previous quarter to $440 million. This impressive growth seems sustainable, as Sandisk's storage solutions have been qualified for use by a second hyperscaler customer, and it is on track to bring additional hyperscalers on board.\n\nSandisk notes that it will begin recognizing revenue from its new hyperscaler customers in the next few quarters. All this explains why analysts are expecting a sharp spike in Sandisk's top line. Specifically, its revenue is expected to more than double in the current fiscal year from $7.36 billion in the previous one, followed by another significant jump in the next fiscal year.\n\nSandisk isn't just enjoying healthy top-line growth. The supply-constrained nature of the memory market is also pushing prices higher. According to market research firm TrendForce, NAND flash memory prices could jump by 55% to 60% in the ongoing quarter, up from the earlier estimate of 33% to 38%.\n\nWhat's more, NAND flash memory is expected to remain in short supply through 2028, driven by a jump of almost 3x in demand by that time as compared to 2024 levels. This should pave the way for a robust jump in Sandisk's earnings, following a projected 1,220% increase in the current one to $39.45 per share. As the following chart indicates, Sandisk's earnings could almost double in the next fiscal year.\n\nGiven that the flash storage market is likely to sustain solid growth beyond next year, Sandisk could see a big jump in its earnings after the next couple of years. But even if we assume a conservative 25% increase in its bottom line in fiscal 2028, its earnings could jump to just over $95 per share within the next three years.\n\nMultiplying the projected earnings by the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 25 points toward a stock price of $2,375, which is over 4x Sandisk's current stock price. So this AI stock has the potential to become a multibagger over the next three years. That's why investors should consider buying it hand over fist, as it is trading at just 15 times forward earnings right now.",

      "Content": "Shares of American Superconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: AMSC) rallied 21.6% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence .\n\nAmerican Superconductor didn't report any financial news this week. Still, the company rocketed higher on the back of a blog post from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , published on Tuesday, which touted the benefits of superconductor technology for AI data centers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft's General Manager of Global Infrastructure Marketing, Alistair Speirs, published a blog post touting the benefits of high-temperature superconductors (HTS). In the post, Speirs noted that Microsoft is investigating HTS technology for use in its data centers.\n\nOf course, as the company's name indicates, American Superconductor Corporation manufactures superconductors for advanced power transmission and military applications for the U.S. Navy.\n\nSuperconductors are metal alloys that can conduct electricity with little or no resistance. Compared with conventional power delivery systems such as copper or aluminum wires, superconductors can move greater amounts of power in a smaller form factor. Thus, if superconductors were used in for power delivery to modern AI data centers, Speirs claims this would greatly relieve pressure on utilities and power delivery systems which are now faced with overwhelming electricity demand.\n\nWhile Speirs' blog post didn't specify if and to what extent Microsoft is deploying this technology, or whether it was working with any utilities to do so, he did write, \"Only recently the economics and manufacturing aspects of this technology made it viable at Microsoft's cloud scale.\"\n\nTo be clear, Microsoft didn't mention American Superconductor in its blog post. However, if superconductors are widely adopted to meet the energy-hungry needs of AI data centers, and if AMSC executes to deliver the technology to AI data center customers, the stock could have significant upside.\n\nLast quarter, American Superconductor beat expectations on revenue and adjusted earnings per share, with revenue up 20% year-over-year to $74.5 million. While shares don't look \"cheap\" at 32 times next year's earnings estimates, American Superconductor is profitable today, which isn't always the case with next-generation technology companies. And if superconductors become widely adopted in AI data centers in the future, those earnings, as well as the stock price, could have significant upside.",

The company is benefiting from the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI)-driven memory and storage markets. The positive impacts of inventory improvement across multiple end markets are driving top-line growth.\n\nThe surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery will aid significant revenue and earnings growth in the coming quarters. Its solid financials, positive free cash flow and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while enhancing shareholder value.\n\nMicron Technology&rsquo;s long-term customer agreements and expanding AI partnerships reduce volatility and enhance revenue visibility. Nonetheless, rising operating costs and a massive increase in capital expenditure pose a downside risk to Micron&rsquo;s near-term profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>> )\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past six months (+22.3% vs. +7.5%). The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. It is refocusing on the core strengths of investment banking (IB) and trading businesses through restructuring and scaling back its consumer banking footprint, which will likely support top line growth in the upcoming period.\n\nHowever, its high dependence on overseas revenues is worrisome. The rising expense base due to ongoing investments in technology and elevated transaction-based costs during periods of higher client activity might hamper near term profitability.\n\nNonetheless, the company's expansion in the private equity credit market is expected to diversify revenues and will support its growth over the long run. Further, a solid liquidity profile will support its capital distribution activities.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Goldman Sachs here >>> )\n\nVerizon&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past six months (+17.7% vs. -1.3%). The company recorded solid fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The buyout of Frontier Communications has accelerated its broadband expansion plans.\n\nVerizon appears to be at a critical inflection point and remains focused on making necessary capital expenditures for steady 5G deployment, the densification of the 4G LTE wireless network to cater to huge traffic demands across multiple verticals and fiber densification.\n\nHowever, the spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage surging data traffic. High spending on promotional activities to attract customers is straining Verizon&rsquo;s profits. Weakness in the wireline business is another concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>> )\n\nShares of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage have underperformed the Zacks Food - Natural Foods Products industry over the past six months (-32.8% vs. -25.9%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $595.64 million is facing risks which include margin pressure from inventory shrink, long-term lease obligations limiting flexibility, macro and supply chain vulnerabilities, and weak digital capabilities. Trading at just 0.43X EV/sales and 6.02X EV/EBITDA, valuations are attractive versus peers.\n\nNevertheless, Natural Grocers posted a 14% YoY rise in Q1 FY26 net income to $11.3M, with EPS up to 49 cents, supported by disciplined cost control and 1.6% revenue growth. EBITDA rose to $22.6M, highlighting operational leverage despite modest top-line gains.

      "Content": "By Jaspreet Singh and Arsheeya Bajwa\n\nFeb 13 (Reuters) - Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot, has been gaining ground in the U.S. over the past months, data showed, even as it draws global ‌censure and regulatory scrutiny after being used to generate a wave of non-consensual sexualized images of ‌women and minors.\n\nU.S. market share of the tool rose to 17.8% last month from 14% in December, and 1.9% in January 2025, according ​to data from research firm Apptopia.\n\nThe increase bodes well for money-losing xAI, the Musk-owned startup behind Grok, which was launched about three years ago and has been spending aggressively to scale the infrastructure needed to stay competitive in Silicon Valley's artificial intelligence race.\n\nIt comes ahead of an initial public offering of Musk's space firm SpaceX that bought xAI ‌earlier this month to consolidate his empire, ⁠and is meant to power his ambitions of putting AI datacenters in orbit.\n\nThe deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, Reuters has reported.\n\nThe jump firmed Grok - built ⁠into Musk's X social media platform - as the third most-used chatbot in the country in January behind market leader OpenAI 's ChatGPT and second-placed Google Gemini, according to Apptopia data.\n\nChatGPT's share slumped to 52.9% last month from 80.9% in January last ​year, ​while Gemini's grew to 29.4% from 17.3% over the same ​period.\n\n\"I suspect that cross-promotion with X is the ‌biggest reason for Grok's growth,\" said Nate Elliott, a principal analyst at Emarketer.\n\nX has integrated Grok across the social media platform, featuring it on the navigation bar and also bundling different tiers of premium Grok access with some of its paid subscriptions.\n\nGrok flooded X last month with AI-altered, near-nude images of real people in response to user requests, triggering global outrage and probes. While curbs X announced stopped Grok's account on the platform from ‌producing such images, the Grok chatbot continues to do so when ​prompted, Reuters found earlier this month.\n\nX and xAI did not respond ​to Reuters requests for comment on Friday.\n\nIndependent journalist ​Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology newsletter first reported the data.\n\nMusk overhauled xAI's management on Wednesday ‌following recent departures of several co-founders that left ​the startup with only half ​of its original 12 co-founders and raised questions about stability at the company.\n\nBut he cheered the growth in usage at the platform.\n\n\"We are also generating 6 billion images in the last 30 days ... Google ​recently posted that ... 1 billion images ‌were generated using Nano banana in 30 days,\" an xAI executive said on Wednesday during an ​all-hands meeting posted on X, comparing xAI's image-generation tool with that of Google's.\n\n\"So, you know, we're ​six times that, right?\"\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru)",

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the tech landscape at breakneck speed, and investors are scrambling to lock in the biggest winners. Yet even in a crowded AI trade, few names have delivered like Micron Technology (MU). The memory-chip giant has ridden the AI wave to record highs, with MU stock delivering massive returns over the past year. Surging demand for memory chips from AI hyperscalers racing to build out massive data center capacity has been the primary engine behind Micron’s remarkable ascent.\n\nBut every rally eventually meets a reality check. Micron’s momentum recently hit a speed bump earlier this week after reports suggested that Samsung Electronics is nearing certification from Nvidia (NVDA) for its next-generation HBM4 chips. High-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized chip designed to move enormous volumes of data at ultra-fast speeds, is a critical component inside AI accelerators.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nStocks Plunge on Tech Weakness and AI Fears\n\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nNvidia relies heavily on HBM for its AI processors, making supplier approvals a closely watched development on Wall Street. Now, with Samsung reportedly preparing to begin mass production of its next-generation HBM chips earlier than expected, competitive dynamics in the AI memory space could shift quickly.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant’s progress threatens to add meaningful pressure on Micron, which is a key supplier of advanced memory products used across data centers and AI infrastructure. Given this latest development, should you buy, sell, or hold MU stock? Let's take a closer look.\n\nBased in Boise, Idaho, Micron Technology stands at the center of the global memory market, supplying the chips that quietly power today’s data-driven world. The company designs and manufactures a broad portfolio of DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory products that sit inside everything from cloud data centers to smartphones and connected devices.\n\nWith a strong emphasis on engineering expertise and manufacturing scale, Micron plays a critical role in enabling AI workloads and other compute-intensive applications. From large-scale data centers to edge devices and mobile platforms, its memory and storage solutions form the backbone of systems that process, store, and move vast amounts of information every day. With a market capitalization of roughly $465 billion, Micron has grown into a semiconductor heavyweight.\n\nShares dipped about 2.8% on Feb. 9 following news surrounding Samsung, but that pullback barely dents what has been an extraordinary run. Over the past year, the stock has skyrocketed an eye-popping 336%, leaving the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) — up just 12% over the same stretch — far in the dust. After touching a record high of $455.50 last month, Micron now sits only about 9% below that peak, underscoring just how powerful its AI-fueled rally has been.\n\nWhile Micron has delivered a breathtaking rally, its valuation remains far from excessive. MU stock trades at roughly 12.6 times forward earnings, a sharp discount to the sector median of 23.6 times. For a company powering the AI memory boom, that gap suggests investors are still paying a relatively modest price for its growth trajectory, even after an extraordinary run.\n\nMicron kicked off fiscal 2026 with a strong quarter. In its Dec. 17 earnings report, the company crushed both top- and bottom-line expectations, posting revenue of $13.6 billion, up 57% year-over-year (YOY) and comfortably ahead of the $12.7 billion consensus estimate. The results marked Micron’s third-straight quarter of record revenue, powered by a 69% surge in DRAM sales and a 22% increase in NAND revenue.\n\nDRAM alone generated $10.8 billion, accounting for 79% of total sales, while NAND contributed $2.7 billion, or 20%. Notably, total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, HBM and data center revenue, and revenue across each business unit all reached new records. Cloud memory sales climbed to $5.28 billion, doubling YOY, while core data center revenue rose 4% annually to $2.38 billion.\n\nThe company said performance across both major segments was driven by higher pricing. Profitability also followed a similar growth trajectory. Adjusted gross margin came in at 56.8%, up from 39.5% in the year-ago quarter. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS soared a stunning 167% YOY to $4.78, crushing the Street’s $3.78 estimate.\n\nLooking ahead, Micron struck an optimistic tone for Q2 fiscal 2026, projecting revenue of around $18.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.42. Management expects strong AI-driven demand across data centers and edge computing to continue, even as supply constraints are likely to persist through 2026, a backdrop that could further reinforce pricing strength.\n\nDespite intensifying competition, Wall Street’s conviction in Micron remains firmly intact. MU stock carries a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, with 33 out of 42 analysts calling it a “Strong Buy,” six assigning a “Moderate Buy” rating, and just three recommending a “Hold.”\n\nEven after its powerful run, optimism hasn’t faded. While MU has already surged beyond its average price target of $345.97, the Street-high target of $500 implies that there could still be roughly 21% upside ahead. That's a sign that many analysts believe the AI-driven momentum is far from over.",

      "Content": "By Matt Tracy\n\nFeb 13 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's global bond sale this week underscored the high level of investor demand for the major AI hyperscalers, but raised concerns about the debt's lack of ‌protections for existing and future bondholders.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet raised $31.51 billion across U.S. dollar, sterling and Swiss franc ‌bond markets in a global bond raise on Monday and Tuesday, as artificial intelligence-driven spending sparks a surge in borrowing at U.S. tech giants.\n\nAlphabet's ​bond sale stood out in several ways, including its use of a so-called 100-year \"century\" bond in the sterling market.\n\nThese and other hyperscalers' recent bond sales have garnered strong reception with Alphabet's $20 billion U.S. bond sale drawing over $100 billion in demand. But the growing hyperscaler debt pile has raised concerns about their lack of investor protections compared to other bonds.\n\n\"What stands ‌out is what’s missing,\" said Julia Khandoshko, ⁠the CEO of Cyprus-based broker Mind Money. \"Once a big name gets covenant-light terms through, others will try the same.\"\n\n\"Naturally, that creates a second-market problem, where the next buyer has fewer 'rules' ⁠to rely on, while prices will swing more on rates, mood, and liquidity,\" she added.\n\nInvestment-grade borrowers with strong credit profiles typically include fewer covenants in debt agreements than their junk-rated counterparts.\n\nYet most include basic investor guardrails, especially a standard change-in-control covenant protecting ​investors ​in the event of M&A or another change in ownership. ​Alphabet's bonds do not carry these protections, noted ‌Anthony Canales, head of global research at New York-based Covenant Review.\n\nThe five major AI hyperscalers - Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft , and Oracle - issued $121 billion in U.S. corporate bonds last year, according to a January report by BofA Securities.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment, while Oracle, Meta and Microsoft declined to comment.\n\nOracle's $25 billion note offering on February 2, and Meta's $30 billion bond offering in October, similarly lacked change-in-control and other basic covenants, Canales noted.\n\n\"In most IG ‌covenant packages you would expect to see a change-in-control covenant,\" Canales ​said. \"But these are huge companies where the investors don't believe there's great ​risk they'll need these protections.\"\n\nFuture tech issuers, especially ​smaller and lower-rated companies, could run into obstacles if they attempt to model their covenants ‌after Alphabet, he added.\n\nNew debt issuance in 2026 ​from the five major hyperscalers ​could reach more than $300 billion as their spending needs around AI buildout increase, BofA Securities analyst Tom Curcurro wrote in a January 12 report.\n\n\"This massive AI infrastructure buildout requires so much capex from the hyperscalers ​that they want to reduce the technical ‌impact on their bonds,\" said Jordan Chalfin, senior analyst at the New York-based research firm CreditSights, ​noting the benefits to issuers from flexible covenant structures.\n\n\"I wouldn’t expect there to be any real ​covenant protections.\"\n\n(Reporting by Matt Tracy in WashingtonEditing by Nick Zieminski)",

      "Content": "Wall Street may argue all about the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, but big tech's spending plans in global AI infrastructure are too large to ignore, right now. Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms expect to collectively spend roughly $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up about 60% year over year.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWith a significant portion of this spending already locked in through data center permits, power contracts, and supply agreements, core AI infrastructure players such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are likely to benefit from the near-term demand.\n\nHere's why stocks of these two companies can go parabolic in the coming years.\n\nNvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, refers to AI as the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history.\" The company estimates global AI infrastructure spending to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of 2030. With a full-stack AI platform that includes hardware, software, and enterprise platforms and an annual product cadence (releasing new upgrades and architectures each year), the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nIn 2026, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting Nvidia's Blackwell B200 systems, which the company claims deliver up to 30x higher inference (real-time model deployment) performance and better power efficiency than the prior-generation H100 chips. The company is also focusing on selling rack-scale solutions such as GB200 NVL72 \"AI factory\" systems, which bundle CPUs, GPUs, networking interconnects, and supporting software into complete AI server solutions, instead of stand-alone chips. This transition can eventually boost average selling prices and the company's margins.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, the company has introduced the Vera Rubin system, a six-chip platform designed to deliver even higher performance and power efficiency than Blackwell systems for complex AI and agentic AI workloads. With Vera Rubin currently in full production, the company expects to launch these systems in the second half of 2026. Management has highlighted cumulative revenue visibility for Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin systems of over $500 billion from the start of 2025 through the end of 2026.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, Nvidia's stock may soar in the coming years.\n\nBroadcom is also a major beneficiary of the increasing enterprise and hyperscaler spending on custom chips and high-speed networking in AI data centers.\n\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, hyperscalers are increasingly deploying custom AI server chips for specialized AI training and real-time deployment workloads. Broadcom is estimated to account for almost 60% share of this market by 2027.\n\nThat growing adoption is already translating into a multiyear backlog. Broadcom exited fiscal 2025 (ending Nov. 2, 2025) with a consolidated backlog of $162 billion, of which custom AI chips accounted for $73 billion to be delivered over the next 18 months. The company's networking switches are also seeing increased demand in AI data centers, as evidenced by the over $10 billion AI switch backlog at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nBroadcom reported a 65% year-over-year jump in AI revenues to $20 billion, driven by demand for custom chips, high-speed networking, and optical interconnects. This revenue growth trajectory can become even steeper if the company's backlog converts as expected or faster, and it has a few new multiyear client wins.\n\nHence, Broadcom can see parabolic growth even at current elevated valuation levels.",

That's 14% higher than today's price.\n\nDespite a Blistering Start to the New Year, the Smart Money is Still Riding with Intel (INTC) Stock\n\nExxon Mobil’s Options Heat Up—31 Unusually Active Contracts Signal Key Trading Setups\n\nOXY Earnings Play: Using Puts to Get Paid While You Wait\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nCSCO is trading at $76.87 , down from a recent peak of $86.78 on Feb. 9, just before the Feb. 11 earnings release.\n\nBased on its strong FCF and FCF margins, despite higher AI-related investments and capital expenditures (capex), Cisco Systems' stock has good upside. This article will show why and a conservative way to play CSCO.\n\nCisco reported that its fiscal Q2 revenue (ending Jan. 24, 2026) was up 10.3% to $15.3 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) rose faster, +11%.\n\nHowever, its operating cash flow (OCF), which includes all cash flow before capital expenditures (capex), was down from $2.24 billion last year to $1.82 billion.\n\nNevertheless, that still represented 11.8% of its quarterly revenue, albeit lower than last year's 16 OCF margin and 21.% in the prior quarter. This can be seen on page 17 of its slide deck:\n\nHowever, after higher capex spending, its Q2 FCF was $1.539 billion (10.0% of revenue) compared to $2.03 billion last year (14.5% FCF margin), according to Stock Analysis.\n\nMoreover, over the trailing 12 months (TTM), its FCF was still strong ($12.24 billion), representing 20.73% of TTM revenue. That was down less from the prior year's 23.6% FCF margin.\n\nAs a result, based on management's higher revenue forecasts for this year, we can expect that FCF could be higher over the next 12 months (NTM).\n\nFor example, management guided that this year it expects revenue to range between $61.2 billion and $61.7 billion (see page 4 of its earnings release). The midpoint of $61.45 billion is 8.5% higher than last year's $56.65 billion revenue.\n\nIn fact, analysts' forecasts are higher. Seeking Alpha shows that 19 analysts project $61.56 billion for the year ending July 2026, and $64.93 billion for the following fiscal year. That implies that over the next 12 months (NTM) revenue could rise to $63.245 billion , up 11.64% over FY 2025.\n\nAs a result, if we assume that Cisco Systems could maintain around 21% FCF margin (slightly higher than its TTM 20.73% margin), FCF could rise to almost $13.3 billion:\n\n$63.245 billion NTM revenue x 0.21 = $13.28 billion NTM FCF\n\nThat would be over $1 billion higher than its LTM FCF of $12.24 billion, or +8.5%.\n\nAs a result, CSCO's value over the next 12 months (NTM) could be higher. Here's why.\n\nRight now, Cisco's stock has a market capitalization of $302.456 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance. As a result, its FCF yield on a trailing 12-month (TTM) basis is just over 4%:\n\n$12.24b TTM FCF / $302.456 b mkt cap = 0.0405 = 4.05% FCF yield\n\nAssuming its FCF yield improves to 4.0% over the next 12 months, the market value could rise to $332 billion:\n\n$13.28 NTM FCF / 0.04 = $332 billion NTM mkt cap\n\nThat's $30 billion higher than todays mkt cap or about 10% higher.\n\nIn other words, even before share buybacks, which have been strong at Cisco, its price target (PT) is 10% higher:\n\n$76.87 x 1.10 = $84.56 PT (i.e., +10%)\n\nThat is even lower than Yahoo! Finance's survey PT of $87.86, and Barchart's mean survey PT of $87.15 per share. Moreover, 18 analysts surveyed by AnaChart.com, which tracks recent analyst write-ups, show an average PT of $98.23. These surveys average $91.06 , or +18.5% higher.\n\nThe bottom line is that CSCO stock could be worth between 10% to 18.5% more than today's price.\n\nOne way to conservatively play this is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in one-month expiration periods. That way, an investor can get paid while setting a potential lower buy-in point.\n\nFor example, look at the March 20, 2026, expiration period. It shows that the $72.50 strike price put, over 5% lower than today's price, has a midpoint premium of $0.87 per put contract.\n\nThat means a short-seller can make $87 immediately after securing $7,250 with their brokerage firm and placing a “Sell to Open” trade order for this contract.\n\nThat represents a one-month yield of 1.20% (i.e., $87/$7,250). The worst that can happen is CSCO falls to $72.50 or lower, and the collateral is used to buy 100 shares at that price.\n\nThis could result in an unrealized capital loss. But the breakeven point is $71.63 (i.e., $72.50-$0.87), which is 6.8% lower than today's price. So, it provides a good potential entry point.\n\nMoreover, less risk-averse investors could use the premium to help buy longer-dated in-the-money (ITM) CSCO call options. That way, they can gain upside in CSCO stock that is potentially greater than buying CSCO shares. I have discussed this in other articles.\n\nThe bottom line is that Cisco Systems' stock looks cheap here, and shorting OTM puts and buying ITM calls are conservative ways to play CSCO.",

Instead, the worry is about AMD's ability to compete in the rapidly rising market for artificial intelligence accelerators.\n\nLuria said that performance at scale depended on more than just chip characteristics, even if AMD's Instinct MI300 GPUs seem to do well on technical benchmarks.

      "Content": "Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) have struggled so far this year, with the stock down more than 18% year-to-date (YTD) and nearly 32% below its 52-week high. Despite the significant pullback, unfavorable industry dynamics around memory supply could weigh on QCOM’s earnings. With sentiment already negative, the possibility of the stock revisiting its two-year low of $120.80 cannot be ruled out.\n\nQualcomm delivered better-than-expected Q1 financial numbers. Revenue of $12.3 billion rose 5% YoY and slightly exceeded consensus expectations, reflecting steady demand across key end markets. The Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) segment delivered $1.6 billion in revenue with a strong EBT margin, supported by higher unit volumes and a favorable product mix.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nThe core Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) business posted revenue of $10.6 billion, driven by demand across smartphones, automotive, and IoT markets. Handset revenues within QCT climbed to a record $7.8 billion, benefiting from the launch cycle of premium flagship devices. IoT revenue grew 9% YoY to $1.7 billion, driven by consumer and networking applications, while automotive revenue reached $1.1 billion, up 15%, as adoption of Snapdragon Digital Chassis platforms accelerated.\n\nIts adjusted EPS of $3.50 rose 3% YoY and surpassed expectations.\n\nThe market’s negative reaction to QCOM stock reflects management’s weak guidance. Management guided for second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.45 to $2.65, both below Wall Street expectations. This raised concerns that near-term headwinds will likely weigh on its growth.\n\nThe most significant challenge impacting Qualcomm's growth is the uncertainty in global memory markets. Surging demand for memory solutions, led by AI data centers, has diverted supply away from smartphones, driving higher prices for handset manufacturers. This has been especially disruptive in China, where OEMs are responding by scaling back production plans and tightening inventory management.\n\nWhile Qualcomm maintains that the fundamental demand environment for handsets remains intact, highlighting better-than-expected global shipments in the December quarter and a strong Snapdragon design win pipeline, the near-term outlook remains cautious. OEMs are adjusting build plans downward to manage cost pressures, and Qualcomm is seeing reduced chipset orders as a result.\n\nFor the second quarter, Qualcomm forecasts QCT handset revenues of $6 billion, reflecting a sharp sequential decline. While management expects QCT handset revenues to return to their prior growth trajectory once memory supply and pricing normalize. However, until visibility into memory availability improves and OEM production plans stabilize, Qualcomm’s earnings may remain under pressure. That uncertainty helps explain why the shares have continued to slide despite solid underlying execution.\n\nWhile the company’s handset revenues could continue to face near-term pressure, management has pointed to meaningful strength in other businesses.\n\nQualcomm’s QCT IoT revenue is projected to grow by a low teens percentage YoY. That growth will likely be driven by expanding demand across both industrial and consumer IoT applications. Further, the momentum in the QCT automotive business will be sustained. Qualcomm anticipates YoY revenue growth accelerating to more than 35% in the second fiscal quarter.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, QCOM stock appears inexpensive at 16.3 times forward earnings. However, that multiple fails to attract. Analysts expect QCOM’s earnings to decline 14.7% in fiscal 2026, and there is still limited visibility into a meaningful reacceleration in fiscal 2027. With handset revenues under pressure and earnings momentum weakening, Qualcomm's stock could still remain under pressure.\n\nAnalysts maintain a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating on QCOM stock. However, if memory constraints persist longer than expected, the risk of Qualcomm shares drifting toward their two-year low increases.",

The decline was due to a slight decrease in non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2025, which dropped 70 basis points sequentially to 75.7% compared to the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributed to a higher mix of hardware sales.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins also fell 150 basis points sequentially to 40.2%, driven by a $16 million increase in operating expenses due to the expansion of the R&D organization, including the aiXscale acquisition.\n\nALAB’s shares have also plunged 33.6% in the trailing six-month period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 10.3% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of 20.3% over the same time frame. The underperformance can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition in the PCIe retimers market.\n\nHowever, the company is benefiting from its robust and diversified product portfolio to address the growing demands of AI infrastructure and connectivity solutions, as well as its expanding partner base.

This growth is expected to be driven by its copper-based product families, including Aries and Taurus signal conditioning solutions, Scorpio AI fabric switches, Leo CXL Memory Controllers, and custom solutions for scale-up connectivity.\n\nAster Lab is benefiting from strong demand for its Aries, Taurus, and Scorpio product families, all of which are expected to drive growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAstera Labs expects first-quarter 2026 revenues between $286 million and $297 million. Earnings are expected to be between 53 cents and 54 cents per share for the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days.

This decrease was primarily attributed to a higher mix of hardware sales.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins also fell 150 basis points sequentially to 40.2%, driven by a $16 million increase in operating expenses due to the expansion of the R&D organization, including the aiXscale acquisition.\n\nALAB’s shares have also plunged 33.6% in the trailing six-month period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 10.3% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of 20.3% over the same time frame. The underperformance can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition in the PCIe retimers market.\n\nHowever, the company is benefiting from its robust and diversified product portfolio to address the growing demands of AI infrastructure and connectivity solutions, as well as its expanding partner base. It benefits from strong demand for its PCIe solutions, which have also been a major growth driver.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ product portfolio, including Scorpio, Aries, and Taurus, has been a key catalyst. In the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB started increasing production of its Scorpio X-Series lead platform.\n\nThe company also expanded the Smart Fabric Switch roadmap with hyperscaler partners, adding new features to meet the needs of next-generation scale-up networking. Early interest from customers is pushing more investment into the quickly growing merchant scale-up switching market, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB expanded its product portfolio with custom NVLink Fusion connectivity solutions designed with hyperscaler partners to optimize heterogeneous AI infrastructure performance, improve energy efficiency, and reduce cost across diverse next-generation AI workloads.\n\nALAB’s expanding portfolio underpins the company’s expectation that its served addressable market opportunity will expand by more than 10x over the next five years to reach $25 billion. This growth is expected to be driven by its copper-based product families, including Aries and Taurus signal conditioning solutions, Scorpio AI fabric switches, Leo CXL Memory Controllers, and custom solutions for scale-up connectivity.\n\nAster Lab is benefiting from strong demand for its Aries, Taurus, and Scorpio product families, all of which are expected to drive growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAstera Labs expects first-quarter 2026 revenues between $286 million and $297 million. Earnings are expected to be between 53 cents and 54 cents per share for the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure calls for a year-over-year increase of 57.58%.\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Astera Labs, Inc. Quote\n\nDespite an expanding portfolio and strong partner base, ALAB is facing stiff competition from other industry players like Marvell Technology MRVL, Credo Technology CRDO, and Broadcom AVGO in the connectivity space.\n\nMarvell Technology is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. Marvell Technology recently completed its acquisition of Celestial AI, strengthening its scale-up optical connectivity capabilities for large-scale AI deployments.\n\nCredo Technology is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market with a healthy pipeline of PCIe Gen6 AECs and retimers, with further customer wins expected to support fiscal 2026 growth. Credo Technology’s shares have rallied 3.8% in the trailing six-month period.\n\nBroadcom is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market by developing advanced solutions that enhance signal quality and extend the reach of PCIe connections in high-speed data environments. Broadcom shares have surged 50.3% in the trailing 12-month period.\n\nAstera Labs’ stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 17.67X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.51X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ strong fundamentals, expanding partnerships, and rising AI demand reinforce its leadership in connectivity solutions. However, challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition remain a headwind. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.\n\nAstera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

      "Content": "Though it may not feel like it amid recent concerns surrounding technology, particularly in software and some other stocks tied to the broader AI frenzy, many in the trade are still crushing it in the new year, delivering big-time gains.\n\nAnd concerning the all-star performers, three stocks that sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER reflect the top three hottest S&P 500 stocks in 2026. What’s been driving the positivity?\n\nSanDisk shares have been melting higher in 2026 months as its role in the broader AI frenzy finally comes into focus. The stock is up more than 160% in the new year alone, by far reflecting one of the strongest moves we’ve seen.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating SNDK’s performance in 2026 relative to the broader Zacks Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI is driving a huge surge in storage demand, which is where SanDisk comes in. NAND prices are rising rapidly, with AI data centers, cloud providers, and edge devices all needing more high-speed storage.\n\nThe company’s revenue acceleration is evident in recent quarterly releases, with sales of $3.0 billion climbing 61% year-over-year throughout its latest period. Its current fiscal year (ends in June) has also confirmed the favorable demand backdrop, with the current $14.1 billion estimate up a staggering 50% over the last year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWDC shares impressively reflected one of 2025’s top-performing S&P 500 stocks as well, with the fresh year already looking bright again. Western Digital provides scalable, sustainable technology for hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers, providing cutting-edge innovation that’s expected to drive the next generation of AI-driven data workloads.\n\nUp nearly 70%, the stock has been red-hot in the fresh year, underpinned by favorable quarterly results that have revealed a massive opportunity for the company.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s cash-generating abilities have seen a nice boost thanks to the environment, with free cash flow of $653 million throughout its latest period up by a triple-digit 125%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s critical to note that Western Digital also holds roughly a 20% stake in SNDK.\n\nTeradyne manufactures equipment used by other companies to test chips. Unsurprisingly, the fastest-growing segment here is chips for AI data centers and accelerators, and more complex chips mean greater test demand, with AI chips among the most complex right now.\n\nUp 60%, the stock has enjoyed a great year so far, particularly so relative to the Zacks Technology sector, which is essentially flat YTD.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTeradyne’s sales growth has been incredible over recent periods, as shown below. Recent quarterly results came in above the high-end of previous guidance, further explaining the positivity behind shares in the new year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile pockets of the broader Technology sector, particularly software, continue to get hammered in 2026, all three above – SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER – haven’t seen hardly any negativity, with all three benefiting in a huge way either directly or indirectly from the AI demand environment.\n\nNotably, all three stocks sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.52 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.7% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Analog Devices, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.9% over the past month to $9.97.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Analog Devices may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Cisco Systems (CSCO) just released an artificial intelligence (AI) networking chip that could reshape how the world's biggest data centers handle AI workloads. The Silicon One G300 delivers 102.4 terabits per second of switching capacity.\n\nThat's more than double what the previous generation could handle. The chip powers new systems designed specifically for massive AI clusters, where thousands of GPUs must constantly communicate.\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nHere's what investors should know about CSCO stock in light of the news.\n\nThe G300 chip tackles AI's biggest infrastructure problem. When training large language models or running AI inference at scale, data must be constantly moved between GPUs. Any delays or dropped packets can stall entire jobs, wasting expensive compute time.\n\nCisco's chip uses something called Intelligent Collective Networking. Think of it as traffic management for data. The chip has an industry-leading buffer that can absorb sudden bursts of traffic without dropping packets. It also continuously monitors the network and reroutes traffic around issues before they cause failures.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Cisco reports that the technology delivers 33% higher network utilization than traditional approaches. Job completion times drop by 28%. That means more AI tokens generated per hour from the same GPU hardware. For companies spending millions on AI infrastructure, those improvements translate directly to better returns on investment.\n\nCisco has built complete systems around the G300 that address AI's power and cooling challenges. The new Cisco N9000 and Cisco 8000 systems come in both liquid-cooled and air-cooled versions. The liquid-cooled systems achieve nearly 70% better energy efficiency. One new system delivers the same bandwidth as six older systems. That matters enormously as data centers struggle with power constraints, fitting more AI capacity in the same physical space while using less energy.\n\nCisco also introduced 1.6 terabit optics and new 800G linear pluggable optics that cut power consumption by 50% compared to older designs. Overall, switch power consumption drops by 30%, improving operational reliability and sustainability.\n\nCisco's management shared compelling numbers during recent investor conferences. The company took in $1.3 billion in AI infrastructure orders during just the first quarter of fiscal 2026. That's from hyperscalers alone. The figure doesn't include sovereign cloud providers, neoclouds, or enterprise customers.\n\nFor fiscal 2026, Cisco expects to take in at least double the $2 billion in AI orders from fiscal 2025, while AI-powered revenue should increase to $3 billion. Even more impressive, Cisco now has design wins at five of the six largest hyperscalers. In Q1 alone, the company won four new design wins across four different hyperscalers. These aren't one-time purchases, as design wins can generate orders for three-plus years. Four hyperscalers increased their orders with Cisco by more than 100% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter. That shows deepening relationships beyond initial trials.\n\nSilicon One gives Cisco real advantages. CFO Mark Patterson called it one of the company's \"most strategic assets.” The chip is also highly programmable. Customers can upgrade equipment with new features even after deployment. That protects long-term infrastructure investments and creates stickiness. Cisco now has a variety of Silicon One product families, covering everything from AI data centers to enterprise networks.\n\nThe hyperscaler business receives the most attention, but Cisco sees significant opportunities elsewhere. For example, the sovereign cloud and neocloud pipeline exceeds $2.5 billion. These customers want AI infrastructure but need local control over their data and operations. Cisco's relationships with partners such as HUMAIN position it well.\n\nEnterprise AI remains early, but could dwarf everything else. Cisco's partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) focuses on simplifying enterprise AI deployment. The companies offer validated reference architectures that remove complexity.\n\nPresident Jeetu Patel noted at Cisco's AI Summit that token generation will become \"one of the core currencies of every company and every country.\" Organizations that can generate AI tokens efficiently and cost-effectively will gain a competitive advantage.\n\nWhile AI grabs headlines, Cisco's campus networking refresh provides steady growth. The company has billions of dollars worth of installed switches approaching the end of support. These older systems pose security risks and can't handle modern AI workloads.\n\nCisco refreshed virtually its entire campus portfolio in June. The new switches incorporate AI and security directly into the fabric. Campus networking orders accelerated in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Adoption of new platforms is happening faster than previous product launches.\n\nThis isn't a one-quarter spike. The campus refresh will unfold over multiple years as enterprises modernize their networks to support AI-powered applications and agile workloads.\n\nCisco generated strong cash flow while investing heavily in AI. The company bought back $2 billion in CSCO stock during Q1 at an average price of $68. That shows management's confidence while returning capital to shareholders.\n\nGross margins held steady at around 68% despite the inclusion of a lower-margin hyperscaler business. The company manages its diverse portfolio to maintain profitability while growing revenue.\n\nOperating expenses are growing more slowly than revenue. Earnings are growing faster than the top line in every recent quarter and in the full-year guidance.\n\nOut of 24 analysts covering Cisco stock, 15 recommend a “Strong Buy,” one recommends a “Moderate Buy,” and eight recommend a “Hold” rating. That makes for a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating. The average CSCO stock price target is $86.90, which represents 16% potential upside from current levels.\n\nThe AI networking opportunity is massive, and Cisco has real technological advantages. Design wins at multiple hyperscalers validate the technology and create multi-year revenue streams.\n\nThe sovereign cloud and enterprise markets are just beginning. As AI moves beyond hyperscalers into broader deployment, Cisco's full-stack approach becomes even more valuable. Cisco's campus refresh also supports steady growth as the company scales its AI infrastructure. Security through Splunk adds another growth vector as customers prioritize protecting AI deployments.\n\nNear-term volatility is possible if AI spending pauses or memory costs spike. But Cisco's diversified business model and strong balance sheet can handle bumps. For investors who can handle some volatility, Cisco offers exposure to AI infrastructure growth at a reasonable valuation with dividend income while you wait.",

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending is poised to jump significantly in 2026, with a recent report from CNBC suggesting that the capital expenditures (capex) of the top four hyperscalers in the U.S. could soar to $700 billion this year. That would be a big jump over 2025's capex of $394 billion.\n\nSemiconductor companies are likely to win big from this massive outlay , as they provide the basic building blocks that enable AI training and inference. Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE) is among the semiconductor companies playing a central role in the proliferation of AI.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nShares of this company that sells optical and photonic networking components enabling high-speed transmission in AI data centers are already trading up 56% in 2026. It won't be surprising to see this stock delivering more gains this year, potentially becoming the best-performing AI chip stock of 2026.\n\nLet's see why that may be the case.\n\nLumentum released its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results (for the period ended Dec. 27, 2025) on Feb. 3. The company reported a 66% year-over-year increase in revenue to $666 million, well ahead of the $652 million Wall Street estimate. Even better, the company's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped nearly 4x year over year to $1.67 per share, crushing the $1.41-per-share consensus expectation.\n\nCEO Michael Hurlston remarked on the latest earnings call that Lumentum is playing a critical role in AI data centers:\n\nImportantly, Lumentum expects to grow at a faster pace going forward, driven by its solid backlog, new contracts, and capacity expansion plans. The company has a backlog of more than $400 million for its optical circuit switches that enable high-speed transmission in data centers.\n\nMeanwhile, the company received what it calls an incremental \"multi-hundred-million-dollar\" contract in co-packaged optics, which are deployed in custom AI processors for their higher bandwidth and energy efficiency.\n\nLumentum has been aggressively expanding capacity to meet the terrific end-market demand. It already achieved more than half of the targeted 40% capacity improvement in the previous quarter. Moreover, Lumentum plans to bring new capacity online at two of its plants in the U.K. and Japan later this year.\n\nLumentum management anticipates an 85% year-over-year increase in revenue in the current quarter to $805 million at the midpoint of its guidance range. Its adjusted earnings forecast of $2.25 per share is almost 4x the earnings it clocked in the same period last year.\n\nAnalysts expect a 263% spike in Lumentum's earnings in the current fiscal year to $7.47 per share, followed by impressive jumps over the next couple of years as well.\n\nThe company may deliver stronger growth as it brings more capacity online. That could pave the way for more upside in this technology stock, which is why investors can consider buying Lumentum before it jumps higher.",

      "Content": "論壇中心／綜合報導\n台股封關氣勢如虹，台積電供應鏈個股表現尤其亮眼，資深分析師蘇威元在《財經週日趴》分享選股心法，他以去年12月推薦的沛亨(6291)為例，該股從175元漲到封關日的276元，短短兩個月就大漲58%，蘇威元強調，抓住飆股關鍵在於「題材要對、財報要爆發」，並掌握四大財務指標。\n蘇威元表示，想要抓到飆股，首先要選對產業族群，像是AI、矽光子、記憶體、PCB、散熱等，都是目前的主流題材。他以去年12月初推薦的沛亨為例，該股同時具備矽光子、記憶體與無人機三大題材加持，當時股價約175元，封關日攻上漲停板來到276元，漲幅高達58%。\n在財務面上，蘇威元建議投資人要關注四大指標：毛利率連續成長、營收年月雙增、本益比相對不高、以及EPS連續跳升。他強調，沛亨的毛利率從2025年第一季的30.18%，一路攀升至第三季的36.46%，呈現連續三季跳升，這種趨勢通常代表股價有很高的噴出機會。月營收方面，沛亨1月營收月增9.47%、年增77.54%，年月雙增表現亮眼。\n在籌碼面上，蘇威元建議觀察千張大戶或600張大戶的動向，搭配外資買進平均成本，當股價站上外資成本之後，往上攻的機會就很高。蘇威元也提醒投資人，雖然技術指標有助於選股，但股市投資仍存在風險，建議投資人在過年期間可以好好做功課，深入研究個股基本面，並依據自身風險承受能力審慎評估，切勿盲目追高，才能在開紅盤後穩健獲利。\n《民視新聞網》提醒您：內容僅供參考，投資人於決策時應審慎評估風險，並就投資結果自行負責。\n原文出處： 財經週日趴(影)／蘇威元：台積電概念股飆漲密碼 這四指標抓飆股一次賺58%",

      "Content": "商傳媒 ｜記者陳宜靖／綜合外電報導\n全球晶圓代工龍頭台積電宣布調整日本布局策略，原定於熊本第二工廠量產6奈米製程，如今轉向更先進的3奈米技術，為日本半導體自主化與產業升級投下震撼彈。隨著人工智慧（AI）與資料中心需求飆升，日本在高階晶片供應鏈中的角色正面臨關鍵轉折。\n根據規劃，台積電位於熊本縣菊陽町的第二工廠，原本鎖定2027年啟動6奈米量產，主攻電動車與高效能運算晶片。然而近期公司高層向日本政府說明，將評估導入3奈米製程，顯示策略方向已從成熟製程升級至尖端技術。半導體線寬愈小，電晶體密度愈高，運算效能與能效比同步提升。3奈米目前廣泛應用於高階智慧型手機與伺服器晶片，是AI算力競賽的核心節點。\n日本過去在半導體材料與設備領域具全球領導地位，但在先進製程量產上逐漸落後。目前日本企業多集中於40奈米以上製程，若能在本土建立3奈米產線，將補強高階晶片缺口，有助於提升整體產業競爭力與經濟安全。尤其在地緣政治風險升高的背景下，分散生產基地成為各國共同課題。\n日本政府已規劃提供最高1.2兆日圓補貼支持台積電設廠。製程升級意味設備與研發成本增加，資金需求勢必擴大。市場觀察，政府在強化供應鏈韌性與財政負擔之間需取得平衡。支持者認為，投資尖端製程可帶動周邊材料、設備與人才培育，創造長期經濟效益；審慎者則指出，高階晶片市場競爭激烈，需求波動風險不容忽視。\nAI浪潮為此次轉向提供重要動能。資料中心對高效能晶片需求激增，3奈米製程成為全球科技企業布局焦點。台積電過去僅在台灣量產最先進技術，如2奈米已於台灣率先啟動試產。若日本成功導入3奈米，象徵技術外溢與國際合作進入新階段，也顯示企業在全球多點布局的策略深化。\n另一方面，日本本土晶片計畫亦同步推進。由政府力挺的Rapidus預計於2027年在北海道千歲市量產2奈米製程，目標打造國產尖端晶片品牌。市場期待台積電與Rapidus形成互補格局，一方面由國際龍頭提供成熟量產經驗，另一方面培養本土自主技術，形成雙軌並進的產業生態。\n產業鏈效應亦備受關注。日本在光阻材料、矽晶圓與半導體設備等領域具深厚實力，若先進製程落地，將強化本土供應鏈整合。熊本大學等學術機構正加速培育半導體專業人才，地方政府亦投入資源建構技術聚落。分析指出，人才與技術累積需時間發酵，短期內仍仰賴跨國合作與經驗移轉。\n綜合觀察，台積電熊本廠升級3奈米不僅是單一企業決策，更牽動日本半導體戰略轉型。從AI算力競逐、供應鏈重組到經濟安全布局，皆顯示全球半導體版圖正重新洗牌。未來能否在成本、技術與市場需求間取得最佳平衡，將決定日本在新一輪晶片競賽中的定位。",

      "Content": "當股價一路刷新歷史高點，投資人往往在「錯過恐懼」與「追高焦慮」之間拉扯。蛇年封關日，台積電（2330）盤中一度觸及1925元，終場收在1915元，再度改寫收盤新高。面對逼近2000元整數關卡的價位，市場開始出現觀望氣氛。\n然而美國知名財經媒體《The Motley Fool》特約分析師Jennifer Saibil卻給出截然不同的看法。她以「像明天就是世界末日般買進」為題，直言即便股價大漲，台積電對長期投資人而言仍具吸引力，並提出三項核心理由。\n首先，她指出台積電的價值不僅建立在AI熱潮之上。雖然高效能運算（HPC）目前已占營收約58%，AI相關需求更是市場焦點，但台積電真正的優勢在於其「長期不可取代性」。從智慧型手機、遊戲主機到人工智慧運算，公司始終與全球科技龍頭合作，成為關鍵晶片代工夥伴。科技趨勢不斷輪替，但台積電幾乎都站在供應鏈核心位置，使其不易因單一題材退燒而失速。\n▼蛇年封關日，台積電（2330）盤中一度觸及1925元，終場收在1915元，再度改寫收盤新高。（示意圖／東森新聞資料照）\n第二，針對市場對資本支出增加的疑慮，分析師認為這反而是成長前兆。台積電2025年第四季毛利率達62.3%，營業利益率54%，展現強勁的獲利能力與定價權。歷史經驗顯示，每逢公司進入新一輪擴產與設備投資週期後，往往伴隨營收與獲利顯著提升。換言之，資本支出上升未必是壓力，而可能是為未來訂單預作準備。\n第三，也是外媒特別強調的一點，是估值面仍具吸引力。儘管台積電ADR過去一年漲幅達61%，但若對照第四季營收年增26%、每股盈餘成長35%的基本面，目前預期本益比約18倍。以其在全球半導體產業的領先地位與長期成長潛力來看，該水準並未顯得過度昂貴。\n▼從外媒分析角度觀察，台積電的競爭優勢與財務表現，仍被視為支撐長期價值的重要基礎。（示意圖／東森新聞資料照）\n在市場情緒逐漸升溫之際，華爾街的聲音反而顯得冷靜且樂觀。股價創高是否意味著短線風險升高，仍取決於投資人自身策略與風險承受度。不過從外媒分析角度觀察，台積電的競爭優勢與財務表現，仍被視為支撐長期價值的重要基礎。\n（封面圖／東森新聞）",

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】金蛇年年終總結算，哪幾檔抱得最安心？資深分析師杜金龍點名台積電(2330)、台達電(2308)、鴻海(2317)是可以長抱的傳家寶股；但提醒，一旦EPS開始出現下降，就不要堅持，開始慢慢調節。\n杜金龍在「鈔錢部署」中表示，傳家寶股票有幾個留意地方：第1是EPS若有下降跡象，就要開始調節，像當年的金融股、台塑四寶，如果沒即時調節很容易燙傷；另外一個是用巴菲特喜歡的DDM(Dividend Discount Model，股利折現模型)去算報酬率。\n杜金龍用DDM方法推算，台積電不論在多頭或是空頭年，平均每年的報酬率高達21%；另外鴻海38年來也是21%。兩者不同地方是鴻海前期走勢較好，台積電則是倒過來，早期不好，這幾年根本噴出去。\n以台積電的ROE（股東權益報酬率）來算，大概是35%，遠遠超過大盤的10%。他說，選傳家寶的股票，不能只看2、3%的現金股息，更重要的是未來的成長性，以及股東權益報酬率。\n杜金龍表示，台積電有機會在4月時上看2字頭，明年上看2400，甚至有人認為台積電可能漲到3030元。他表示，如果台積電漲到2400元，台股的位階就是要到4,3000點；若是台積電來到3030元，大盤點數就是7,3000點。\n台積電若到2400元，台股上看4萬3！\n杜金龍說，如果台積電今年能夠看到2字頭，明年搞不好3字頭就會出現。\n第2檔傳家寶就是台達電。目前外資目標喊到1400元，台達電已經來到1260元，杜金龍表示，當川普說AI廠要自己備電源，從那一天以後，台達電就跟一條活龍一樣。目前法人估台達電EPS明年到60元，以此來看，本益比稍微高一點，但現在電子的本益比都提升，台達電也不例外。\n先前杜金龍把台達電賣飛，他希望在過年後有機會買回來。\n再來是鴻海，現在的老AI因為DRAM、被動元件都漲，伺服器的成本提高，不像台積電、南亞科的毛利率那麼高，所以只要成本調高一些，就會稀釋掉毛利率，這也是為何最近這一陣子鴻海的漲勢被壓抑。\n現在的外資還持續在賣鴻海，鴻海是杜金龍推薦的3檔傳家寶股裡面唯一沒漲的股票，但是為何不賣它？杜金龍表示，就因為它沒漲，等到大盤到４月要漲一個末升段，鴻海就有可能會補漲，現在若賣飛，等到正式補漲後又沒來得及追高補回，反而是兩頭空。(新聞來源：旺得富理財網 王郁惠)\n※免責聲明：文中所提之個股、ETF內容，並非任何投資建議與參考，請審慎判斷評估風險，自負盈虧。",

      "Content": "Got some idle money you're ready to put to work for a while? Is there $1,000 you have available (or any amount, really) that you'd like to turn into something more? That's easier said than done right now. Too many stocks have demonstrated a bit too much vulnerability of late. Another wave of weakness feels possible.\n\nNot every name is uncomfortably risky here, however. Even if the market does get upended again, a few stocks are apt to hold up well enough and then enjoy more than their fair share of any recovery. Here's a rundown of three of these names.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nQualcomm 's (NASDAQ: QCOM) 23% share price pullback from its early January peak makes enough superficial sense. Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\n\nPayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\n\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\n\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\n\nFinally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\n\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $492,937 !*\n\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $52,460 !*\n\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $429,385 !*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee the 3 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 9, 2026\n\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) has been one of the hottest stocks in the market, but a 14% pullback from highs hit in early February could be a buying opportunity. And despite its recent highs, the stock is still not expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15 times analyst estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) and just over 7.5 times fiscal 2027 estimates.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe company is a leading producer of NAND storage devices, or flash memory. It is one of the few pure-play ways to invest in this segment of the tech market after the company was spun off from Western Digital about a year ago. NAND has been a very cyclical market over the years, but the space looks like it is at the beginning of what appears to be a long-lasting supercycle.\n\nIt was only a few years ago that the NAND market was in complete disarray. After seeing huge demand for electronics stemming from the pandemic, memory makers overbuilt production, causing a huge oversupply in the market that led prices to crash. Things became so bad that NAND gross margins turned negative.\n\nThis disarray led many memory makers to hugely cut NAND production and redirect their focus to DRAM (dynamic random access memory). At the same time, the introduction of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized form of DRAM, began to take off because of its importance in helping optimize the performance of graphics processing units when running artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. HBM comes with strong unit economics, but it needs huge wafer capacity, so it began eating up memory maker resources.\n\nSoon after, AI data centers also started to need huge, high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs) that use NAND to help store training data. With production slashed and demand now suddenly surging, flash memory prices have been skyrocketing because there is now a huge NAND shortage. Given the economics and demand for HBM, along with growing demand for NAND, these market dynamics are unlikely to shift anytime in the near future.\n\nWith flash memory in short supply, Sandisk continues to benefit from increased prices, which are also dramatically lifting its gross margins and profits. Last quarter, its revenue jumped 61%, while its gross margins expanded from 32.3% a year ago to 50.9%, leading its adjusted earnings per share to surge fivefold.\n\nWith the NAND market going from a cyclical business to a structural growth story on the back of AI data centers, Sandisk finds itself in an enviable position. And with the boom in AI infrastructure spending, the company is set to see huge growth ahead. This makes the recent dip a buying opportunity.",

      "Content": "The global semiconductor industry appears to be going through structural tailwinds. Fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, global semiconductor industry annual sales are projected to touch $975 billion in 2026, a historic peak. Furthermore, with sustained growth, annual sales may touch $2 trillion by 2036.\n\nWith that in mind, it's unsurprising that semiconductor stocks have surged higher. While some investors might have missed out on the big rally, there also still seem to be pockets of opportunity left. Amid volatility, shares of STMicroelectronics (STM) have trended 43% higher in the last 52 weeks. This lesser-known chip stock seems to hold significant potential.\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\nPfizer Reports Strong Earnings Outlook - Unusual Call Options Activity Shows Investors are Bullish\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nSTMicroelectronics recently announced a partnership with Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS), and this multi-billion-dollar collaboration underscores the point of scope for value creation. As part of the deal, STM will be a supplier of advanced semiconductor technologies and products to AWS. Further, STM will issue warrants to AWS for up to 24.8 million shares. Besides establishing credibility, this deal is likely to be a top-line growth driver for STMicroelectronics and STM stock.\n\nBased in the Netherlands and headquartered in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics is a designer, developer, and manufacturer of semiconductor products globally. The company’s key business segments include RF & Optical Communications, Analog Products, MEMS & Sensors, Embedded Processing, and Power & Discrete Products. In terms of end users, the automotive, industrial and personal electronics segments are business growth drivers for the company.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, STMicroelectronics reported revenue of $11.8 billion with a gross margin of 33.9%. For the same period, the firm reported free cash flow of $265 million.\n\nWhile STMicroelectronics reported revenue degrowth in fiscal 2025, SMT stock has trended higher by 28% in the last six months, in part due to a positive long-term outlook backed by key strategic partnerships.\n\nWhile revenue degrowth is a concern, STM stock has been in an uptrend. After all, the company has multiple growth catalysts in the next few years. The partnership with AWS is one growth trigger. Similarly, the company’s chip supply to SpaceX for Starlink is expected to double in the next two years.\n\nSTM has also indicated that revenue from silicon carbide power devices is expected to return to 2024 levels by next year. This is after a contraction in revenue in 2025. Further, the firm is targeting data center revenue of $1 billion before the end of the decade.\n\nIn another important development in December 2025, the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed a €500 million financing agreement with the company. This is the initial tranche for a €1 billion credit line that’s intended to boost Europe’s competitiveness in the semiconductor sector. According to the agreement, 60% of the funds will be utilized toward “high-volume manufacturing capabilities” within Europe while 40% will be dedicated to research & development activities. These investments are likely to translate into growth and provide STM with an innovation edge, especially with the emphasis on R&D.\n\nGiven the ratings of 17 analysts, STM stock is a consensus “Moderate Buy.” While eight analysts assign a “Strong Buy” rating to STM, another eight have a “Hold\" rating while one analyst has a bearish “Strong Sell” rating.\n\nBased on these opinions, STM stock has a mean price target of $33.25 currently, implying potential downside of 1% from current levels. However, the most bullish price target of $45 suggests that STM could rise as much as 34% from here.\n\nOne important point to note is that STM stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 times. With analysts estimating earnings growth of 100% and 68% for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively, shares will likely remain in an uptrend.",

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BTDR.\n\nIs BTDR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nQ : What are the main items being discussed in your co-location negotiations? Is it down to price, duration, timing, or design? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: Discussions vary with different counterparties, covering all those aspects. These discussions are sensitive and active, and while we are confident about closing deals soon, predicting the exact timeframe is challenging.\n\nQ : Regarding financing, what should we expect in terms of debt, cost of capital, and credit enhancements? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The cost of capital will depend on the counterparties and deal terms, making it hard to predict until deals are finalized. Credit enhancements are crucial for determining development costs, and we are exploring various approaches, though nothing dramatically different from existing market practices.\n\nQ : Can you provide more details on the infrastructure piece, specifically the Tel Norway site and its customer profile? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The Tel Norway site retrofit is expected to complete by year-end, with production GPUs installed early next year. The site benefits from a low PUE of around 1.1 due to its hydropower and cold climate. Customer discussions are sensitive, but there is overlap with US customers.\n\nQ : How should we think about the growth of your Bitcoin mining business in 2026, especially with AI infrastructure deals in play? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: We are long-term believers in Bitcoin and will continue investing in mining capacity. While we haven't projected future hash rates, we remain committed to expanding our self-mining operations.\n\nQ : With lower Bitcoin prices, is there a point where you would slow mining activity due to higher costs? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: There is a price point where we might slow down, but we haven't reached it yet. Our fleet's efficiency and low energy costs allow us to continue operations even if prices drop further. Older machines might be turned off first, but we don't anticipate reaching that point soon.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .",

      "Title": "What Makes Monolithic Power (MPWR) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-monolithic-power-mpwr-strong-170004817.html",
      "Content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In \"long context,\" investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Monolithic Power (MPWR) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monolithic Power currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MPWR that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor MPWR, shares are up 9.4% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is up 7.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.67% compares favorably with the industry's 11.65% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Monolithic Power have increased 35.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 71.09% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.65% and 15.6%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of MPWR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now MPWR is averaging 710,006 shares for the last 20 days..\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MPWR.\n\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPWR's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.91 to $21.63 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPWR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Monolithic Power on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThursday, Feb. 12, 2026 at 8:00 a.m. ET\n\nChief Executive Officer — Jihan Wu\n\nChief Business Officer — Haris Basit\n\nChief Financial Officer — Matt Linghui Kong\n\nHaris will provide a high-level overview of Bitdeer Technologies Group's fourth quarter 2025 results and discuss the company's strategy, provide a detailed business update, and review the financial results for the quarter. Jihan, Matt, and Haris will be available for questions after the formal remarks. To accompany today's call, we have provided a supplemental investor presentation available on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s investor relations website under Webcasts and Presentations. Before management begins their formal remarks, I would like to remind everyone that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.\n\nFor a more complete discussion on forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties related to Bitdeer Technologies Group's business, please refer to the company's filings with the SEC. In addition to discussing results calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, we will also reference certain non-IFRS financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit and loss. For more detailed information on our non-IFRS financial measures, please refer to our earnings release published earlier today, which can be found on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s IR website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Haris. Thank you, John, and good day, everyone.\n\nHaris Basit: It is great to be with you today. The 2025 marked a defining period of execution and strategic progress for Bitdeer Technologies Group. Achieved critical milestones across our three strategic pillars, and position the company for sustained growth as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company. I will start with a brief overview of our financial performance for the quarter. Fourth quarter total revenue reached $225,000,000, up 226% year over year and 33% sequentially. Gross profit totaled $10,600,000, adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000 for the quarter.\n\nWhile both metrics declined sequentially, the results primarily reflect a combination of lower average Bitcoin pricing, modestly higher electricity costs, substantially higher depreciation expense due to the rapid expansion of our self-mining capacity, and further investment in new talent to support our growing AI HPC initiatives. I will discuss these factors in greater detail later in the call. Let me begin with a brief review of our power and infrastructure portfolio. We continue to make meaningful progress during the quarter, advancing a global portfolio of sites that we believe are well suited to support both large-scale Bitcoin mining and next-generation AI and HPC workloads.\n\nAcross regions, our focus remains on developing power-rich, capital-efficient infrastructure that provides flexibility, speed to market, and long-term strategic optionality. From an energy infrastructure perspective, execution during the quarter remained on track. At the January, we had over 1.66 gigawatts of capacity online, and a total global power pipeline of three gigawatts. We believe this represents one of the most attractive and AI-suitable power portfolios in the industry and provides us with a vast opportunity as the demand for such capacity continues to grow. Over the past several months, have seen a significant shift in market dynamics around AI data center development.\n\nDemand for large-scale colocation capacity has increased substantially and we have responded by refining our approach to better align with this opportunity. Therefore, we are currently prioritizing colocation services provided to Norway and the United States that are suitable for large-scale AI HPC deployments. Let me walk through a few sites and where we stand with our development plans. First, Teadle, Norway, represents our most near-term colocation opportunity. This 225-megawatt facility was originally constructed to Tier III data center specifications, which puts us in a favorable position for conversion to AI workloads.\n\nWe estimate the retrofit will require much less incremental capital expenditure to add uninterruptible power supply systems, backup batteries, and generation, as well as some additional cooling capacity compared to industry benchmarks for greenfield Tier III data center development, which typically run in the $8,000,000 to $12,000,000 per megawatt range. The site benefits from hydropower with attractive economics; independent 100-megawatt transformers provide redundancy. We are currently in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expect to be in a position to announce a signed lease agreement for Teadle as soon as possible in 2026, although the exact timing is very difficult to predict.\n\nThis site should be capable of supporting initial test GPU deployment late 2026 and first production GPUs expected in early 2027. Second, our 570-megawatt site in Clarington represents one of the larger AI data center development opportunities in the United States. Have made progress on two fronts here. First, the local utility has accelerated our interconnection timeline. Second, we are currently in discussion with multiple prospective tenants. These are well recognizable companies in the space, and the discussions are progressing. While litigation has recently been filed that could potentially delay development at this location, believe that we have meritorious claims and a strong defense and will pursue an expedient solution.\n\nGiven the scale of this site, even a partial or first phase lease would represent a significant milestone for Bitdeer Technologies Group and would provide substantial contracted revenue while derisking our development capital. Third, at Rockdale, we are pursuing a strategy that allows us to maintain our current Bitcoin mining operations while developing new HPC capacity. We are evaluating the acquisition of adjacent land to our existing facility we could potentially construct a purpose-built HPC data center. This approach would minimize disruption during data center development to our 563-megawatt mining operation, which continues to generate revenue. The greenfield HPC build would be designed from the ground up for AI workloads.\n\nThe Rockdale site benefits from its location in the ERCOT market, provides operational flexibility. We are currently talking with prospective colocation tenants for this site. The dual-track approach, maintaining Bitcoin mining while developing HPC capacity, reflects our commitment to both businesses and our ability to optimize our power portfolio across use cases. While we are prioritizing colocation for our larger sites, continue to see opportunity in GPU-as-a-service for targeted markets. We are expanding our cloud platform in Malaysia by 10 to 15 megawatts, building on the success we have had in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming sectors who need fully managed orchestrated infrastructure.\n\nIn the United States, we are planning to add 10 megawatts of GPU capacity in Washington state and are evaluating a partial conversion of our Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud. I want to be clear that the scale of our long-term US GPU-as-a-service expansion is predicated on signing customer contracts. Do not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. Expect all major GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customers who are seeking meaningful capacity with comprehensive managed services. This disciplined approach ensures we are deploying capital we have revenue certainty. A key element of our strategy is how we are approaching data center development.\n\nWe have built an internal development team with experience in very large data center construction and we are augmenting that team through strategic hires, working with experienced EPC contractors and general contractors on a fee basis rather than through joint venture arrangements. This gives us greater control over timelines and specifications, and importantly, it allows us to retain more of the economic value these assets generate. As we look ahead, the growth will continue to be anchored by our three strategic pillars, between mining, ASIC development, and HPC AI. Together, these represent a vertically integrated, highly defensible platform that leverages our deep technology expertise, proprietary chip design capabilities, and extensive global power portfolio.\n\nThe supply-demand imbalance for AI compute continues to widen, and we expect this shortage to persist well into 2027. Time to power is a critical variable, and we believe Bitdeer Technologies Group is exceptionally well positioned to serve customers seeking both near-term and midterm capacity. On the Bitcoin mining side, the rapid expansion of our self-mining platform continues. We exited the year with more than 55 exahash per second of self-mining hash rate, and in the month of January alone, we brought another eight exahash per second online, exiting the month of January at over 63 exahash per second. This firmly establishes Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miners by total hash rate under management.\n\nSupported by the disciplined rollout of our SealMiner fleet, accelerated deployment of SealMiner rigs has driven material improvements in fleet-wide efficiency. The SealMiner A2 and A3 being actively deployed in our self-mining business operate at approximately 15 to 16.5 joules per terahash and 12.5 to 14 joules per terahash respectively, and represent industry-leading power efficiency. As these next-generation rigs replace legacy third-party equipment, our blended fleet efficiency continues to improve, with our overall fleet-wide efficiency currently standing at 17.5 joules per terahash as of 01/31/2026. As SealMiner penetration increases throughout 2026, we expect our overall fleet-wide efficiency to continue to improve, enhancing our mining margins. Looking ahead, our self-mining operations are not plateauing.\n\nOur investments in chip design are delivering tangible results. During the quarter, we commenced mass production of the SealMiner A3 series. Initial shipments began in November, and we have deployed a total of 8.7 exahash of our SealMiner A3 to date. As we continue to retire older-generation third-party rigs, we expect the A3 series to continue to meaningfully contribute to our fleet efficiency improvements and growth throughout 2026. On the R&D front, our CLO4-1 chip was completed back in September. The CLO4-1 represents a meaningful step forward in efficiency and positions Bitdeer Technologies Group to maintain technological leadership as the industry continues its relentless drive towards lower power consumption per unit of hash rate.\n\nMass production of mining rigs based on the CLO4-1 chip will begin in Q1 2026. CLO4-2 chip design remains under development at our US-based design center. Additionally, we have successfully taped out a new Litecoin chip, SEAL-DL1, designed for Doge and Litecoin mining. The initial test results of SEAL-DL1 have exceeded comparable rigs in both energy efficiency and hash rate. On the recent market conditions, the CLDL1 generates higher fiat-based returns per megawatt than our SealMiner A2. Preparation for USA SealMiner manufacturing remains in progress. This initiative is a core component of our vertically integrated strategy and aligns with both operational resilience objectives and evolving trade and supply chain dynamics.\n\nNow let me walk through our detailed financial results for the quarter. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that all figures I refer to today are in US dollars. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $224,800,000, up 225.8% year over year and up 32.5% sequentially. The year-over-year growth and sequential growth in revenue was primarily driven by significantly higher self-mining hash rate as a result of continued CLMiner deployment, as well as contributions from SealMiner sales, offset in part by slightly lower Bitcoin prices for the quarter. Self-mining revenue was $168,600,000, compared to $41,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $130,900,000 in Q3 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 306% and a sequential growth of 28.7%.\n\nContinued growth from Q3 2025 levels reflects a significant increase in average operating hash rate and associated Bitcoin production during the quarter, offset in part by 13% lower average Bitcoin prices quarter on quarter. SealMiner sales revenue was $23,400,000, up 105.4% over the $11,400,000 reported in Q3 2025. Total gross profit for the quarter was $10,600,000, reflecting a gross margin of 4.7%, versus 7.4% in Q4 2024 and $40,800,000 or 24.1% in Q3 2025. Significant decline in gross margin reflects the combined impact of several drivers during the quarter. First, obviously, we experienced 13% lower Bitcoin prices during the quarter along with the gradual increase of the global hash rate.\n\nSecond, on the cost side, experienced an approximately 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit during the quarter when compared to Q3 2025, mainly due to the seasonal winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites. Third, the growth in our self-mining hash rate comes with a concurrent noncash depreciation expense associated with this fleet of new miners. Additionally, during the quarter, we changed our methodology for calculating depreciation expense to reflect a more conservative approach. Now depreciate rigs using a three-year straight-line method versus our prior assumption of a five-year depreciable life for hardware. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $66,300,000 compared to $42,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $60,500,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following factors compared to Q3. We added more headcount to support both mining site operations and our AI infrastructure expansion, incurred additional holiday season compensation, along with an increase in year-end general corporate activities. These expenditures reflect the operational requirements of our growing infrastructure footprint and the resources necessary to execute on our strategic initiatives. Other operating expenses for the quarter was $43,800,000 compared to $3,700,000 in Q4 2024 and other operating income of $26,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to the fair value change of Bitcoins pledged for the Bitcoin-collateralized loan since Q3 2025.\n\nOther net gain for the quarter was $208,900,000 compared to other net loss of $4 and $79,800,000 in Q4 2024 and $238,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to noncash fair value change of derivative liabilities related to the convertible senior notes issued in November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025. Adjusted net loss was $82,600,000 versus $37,400,000 in Q4 2024 and $36,300,000 in Q3 2025. The increase in loss was primarily due to higher energy and depreciation costs, higher operating and interest expense, partially offset by the year-over-year higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000, versus negative $4,300,000 in Q4 2024 and positive $39,600,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential decline was primarily driven by higher energy costs and higher operating expenses attributed to salaries and wages for recent additions to our headcount, as well as a number of elevated costs associated with year-end holiday allowance and year-end general corporate activities. To provide a better sense of our G&A expense on a run-rate basis, our Q4 2025 results reflect approximately $3,000,000 of salary, wage, and benefits expense which will largely be recurring, as well as another $6,000,000 to $7,000,000 in consulting, legal, and travel expenses which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was $599,500,000, primarily driven by SealMiner supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs from the mining business, general corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97,900,000, which includes $50,700,000 of capital expenditures relating to data center infrastructure construction, GPU equipment procurement, and tariffs and freight for mining rigs delivered to the data centers, and $150,600,000 of proceeds from the disposal of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the quarter $454,500,000, which resulted primarily from $388,500,000 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $168,000,000 in borrowings from a related party, and $141,500,000 of proceeds from shares sold under our ATM and ELOC program, free offset by $171,100,000 of repayments of borrowings. For the full calendar year 2025, capital expenditures for the continued build out of our global power and data center infrastructure totaled $176,000,000. Looking to full year 2026, we anticipate total infrastructure spend in the range of $180,000,000 to $200,000,000 for crypto mining data center construction.\n\nPlease note that this guidance covers power and crypto mining data center infrastructure only and does not include CapEx for SealMiners and GPU. AI cloud and colocation capital expenditures are also not included. Turning to our balance sheet and financial position. We exited the year with $149,400,000 in cash and cash equivalents, $83,100,000 in cryptocurrencies, held at cost less impairment, $135,600,000 in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1,000,000,000 in borrowings excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities were $501,100,000, relate to the November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025 convertible senior notes.\n\nThis represents $171,400,000 reduction compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a noncash fair value adjustment driven by the change in our stock price and settlement for partial principal of November 2024 convertible senior notes. As I mentioned earlier, this does not impact our liquidity or operations. Regarding our outstanding ATM and ELOC facility, we received approximately $143,600,000 in gross proceeds during the quarter. Approximately 6,700,000 additional shares issued. We have exercised disciplined capital allocation throughout the year using the ATM and ELOC opportunistically to support our growth initiative while minimizing dilution.\n\nAs a final note to our financial update, we wish to note that starting in Q1 2026, we will begin to use GAAP instead of IFRS as our accounting standard. In summary, we are proud of our team's execution this quarter and throughout 2025. I want to express my deep pride what our team has accomplished this year. Established Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the world's largest publicly listed Bitcoin mining operators by total hash rate under management. Our leadership position in self-mining and our proprietary SealMiner technology provide multiple paths to value creation that few, if any, competitors can match.\n\nOur pipeline of developed and contracted power capacity gives us a meaningful competitive edge in serving a variety of customers. The colocation opportunity ahead of us is immense, we are pursuing it proactively. We enter 2026 with strong operational momentum, a differentiated asset base, and a team that has proven its ability to execute at scale. Excited about what lies ahead and remain committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, Operator. Please open the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open for questions. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press *11 and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press *11 again. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Giles of B. Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nNick Giles: Yes. Thank you so much, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Haris, really appreciate the comprehensive update, especially on the colocation side. And my first question was just, and I am sure you are speaking to a range of customers, and you know, at this point of negotiations or discussions, what is really the main items that are being discussed? Is it down to price, duration, timing? There is still a lot of work ongoing around design. Just any additional color on where you stand in the process.\n\nHaris Basit: It is different with different potential counterparties, and we are all of those things that you mentioned are being discussed, maybe not with the same counterparty, but you know, I hesitate to say too much about these discussions. They are sensitive, and you know, very active at this time. So you know, we feel pretty confident that we are going to get colocation deals done in the near future. Predicting that time frame is going to be hard. And, you know, the discussions are pretty intense with several counterparties.\n\nNick Giles: No. Understood. That is helpful, and just my second question was, we think about financing, you made some important comments there on having a larger share of the economics. But should we be expecting in terms of debt cost of capital and what kind of credit enhancements are you looking at, if any?\n\nHaris Basit: Cost of capital for these projects, for the colocation projects, will be very much determined by the counterparties and exact terms of the deal. So I think that is hard to predict right now until we, you know, announce which of these deals are done with which counterparties. Was that responsive to your question? I am not sure if that is what you were.\n\nNick Giles: Asking.\n\nHaris Basit: I mean, that is an important part of any deal. And, you know, it is because it does determine the cost of development to a large extent. And so we are, you know, we are looking at many different approaches here. It is a very important part of getting the deal done right. So it is something that we are focusing on as well. I cannot really say which ones are better or worse. It depends a lot on the counterparty, and it depends on, you know, there is a number of ways to do this. Most of them have been already done in the Marketplace.\n\nAnd know, I do not think you will see anything too dramatically different from those when we announce.\n\nNick Giles: Got it. Understood. Well, again, I appreciate the update, and continue. Best of luck.\n\nJihan Wu: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Colonnese of H.C. Wainwright & Co. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Colonnese: Today. First one for me on the infrastructure piece. It sounds like you are pretty far along in negotiations for a potential colo deal at the Teadle site. Curious what type of customers you are in discussions with specifically at that campus. And, Haris, if I heard correctly, it sounds like the full retrofit for the 225 megs could be completed by the end of this year. There a PUE you guys are assuming that number? I know it is built with Tier III standards in mind, but any additional color would be helpful there.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is correct. We do expect completion of that Teadle Norway site in at the end of this year and then installation of production GPUs at the beginning of next year. And the PUE at that site is actually very low, which is one of the biggest advantages of that site. It is, you know, it is 100% hydropower. It is a nice cold climate. And there is chilled water available from a nearby lake. So the PUE there, for estimation purposes, is around 1.1. It is dramatically better than most locations.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. And then, the typical customer profile for that site specific, I know you are in discussions with the range of customers across the portfolio. I would be just curious with that international facility, the type of customers you are looking at.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, there is some difference, but, you know, there is still a lot of overlap with the customers there versus customers in the United States. So but, you know, I really do not want to say too much about who we are talking to and the exact nature of those deals. They are fairly sensitive negotiations at this point. Understood. Understood. And then as it relates to the Bitcoin mining business, you guys are one of the few public miners that continue to rapidly expand your self-mining capacity. How should we think about growth in this business in 2026? Particularly as you look to pursue these AI infrastructure deals across parts of the portfolio?\n\nHaris Basit: So one thing to say is that we are long-term believers in Bitcoin. And, of course, Bitcoin is in a little bit of a down cycle right now. But long term, we believe in Bitcoin. And we will continue to invest in our Bitcoin mining capacity. We have not given any projections for what the total hash rate for our company might be by the end of this year or in any future quarter yet. We are still evaluating that and we may project that at a later time. But at this time, we do not have any projections to share publicly for future growth of our hash rate.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. Thanks for the color, Haris, and best of luck with these opportunities.\n\nOperator: Thank you, Mike. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on all this capacity you have activated. But maybe along those lines that was asked before, with the lower Bitcoin prices, is there a price where you slow your mining activity because costs are higher versus what the hash price would be?\n\nHaris Basit: I am sure there is such a price, so we just have not reached it yet. So you know, our efficiency of our fleet keeps improving. And, so it also, you know, as price goes down, it be the entire fleet. Some parts of the fleet, you know, because of the efficiency and because of the energy price at that location, can continue to operate for quite some, you know, in quite some even further decrease beyond here. And then you will, some of the older machines that have been around for several years, those could be turned off first. Right? In fact, just in our normal upgrade cycle, we will be replacing those.\n\nSo there is, you know, we have not reached that point now, and I do not anticipate that we will. But, you know, of course, there is such a price. It is just much lower than what we are at now.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. That is good information. I guess as you keep lowering your costs, then you can handle lower Bitcoin prices. But just as another topic, is the GPU-as-a-service, is there a good market for the, say, N minus one GPU clusters rather than spending money on the very leading edge of GPUs? Is there still a need for GPU-as-a-service for the older GPUs?\n\nHaris Basit: Yes. There is. We are, though, however, typically pursuing the latest and greatest GPUs. But I mean, we still get demand for, you know, even our oldest H100s that we have in Singapore.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi of ROTH. Your line is now open.\n\nDarren Aftahi: Yes, good morning. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Haris, could you dive a little bit more into sort of the scale and scope of the hires you have made for digital infrastructure towards the end of the year that you spoke to, and then kind of the cadence of continued investment in maybe Q1 and into 2026? I guess, at what point do you feel like you have an adequate team to kind of attack this opportunity?\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, we are very pleased with some of our recent hires. We have hired people with direct expertise in AI, in cloud services. And a lot of those folks have been in the United States, but also in Asia. The team is, you know, the number of people dedicated to this has grown dramatically. I do not think I have an exact number. But we continue to hire. I do not think we have reached, you know, a place where we think we have enough folks yet. But we are still looking for people, especially on the side of the engineering part of building data centers with still open racks there. So no.\n\nI expect that we will continue to hire throughout the year. And a lot of those folks will be in the United States. But, you know, we have also done significant AI hiring in Asia.\n\nDarren Aftahi: Got it. And then same question on the Rockdale site is sort of twofold. In terms of land acquisition for that, kind of where are you, and what is the timeline on process? And then I know Oncor is supposed to put another substation in, and I think you guys have spoken to additional capacity there. I think it is in the 100-some plus megawatts. But in light of kind of the seesaw that is going on with ERCOT and decision on batching, just kind of curious about your thoughts about prospects of Rockdale actually growing as a site. Thanks.\n\nHaris Basit: The recent, you know, information around ERCOT and power allocation in that region, we do not believe that applies to the growth at Rockdale. So the 179, up to 179 megawatts that we anticipate we could add there, should not be affected by that. And I say it that way because, of course, we do not know what the exact regulations will be. They are just still under discussion. So we do expect that we will get most of that, if not all of that additional capacity. The land acquisition there is moving forward. You know, it is not done until it is done, but we are, we are, yeah.\n\nI am not sure how to characterize where we are in that process, but, you know, we are actively pursuing it. And we expect that we will finish it. But until we do, it is hard to say exactly when that is going to happen. Great. Appreciate the insights. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Greg Lewis of BTIG. Your line is now open.\n\nGreg Lewis: Hey. Thank you, and good morning. Good open. Hey, I guess first, I mean, on published numbers, I guess you guys are the bitcoin miner of the listed companies by XFASH. So congrats on that. I did want to talk a little bit about the GPU business. You noted about potential expanse. You should a mouthful. The potential expansion in Malaysia. Know, just kind of curious, is that infrastructure that we are building, are we leasing? And then just kind of how should we think about, you know, the rollout of that, I guess, I think you mentioned 15 megawatts in Malaysia for the GPUs.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is infrastructure that we are leasing. I welcome Matt or Jihan to add to that. They want. But what was the second part of your question? How should we think about the rollout of bringing those 15 megawatts online and generating revenue from that? I mean, we have proactively purchased some, I think, the GB200 NVL72 and installed it just recently there. So that is in place right now. In terms of additional machines there, do not think we have made any announcements at present. So that is actually.\n\nGreg Lewis: Okay. But it is, but it sounds like it sounds like we could start seeing revenue maybe in the second quarter, and then maybe that scales up sequentially for a couple of quarters?\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I think, John and Matt are closer to that than I am. So I do not know if, is that a, is that a correct statement that you have?\n\nJihan Wu: I think we will be able to deploy GPUs into those infrastructures at the fourth quarter or third quarter of this year. It depends on when that infrastructure will be ready. We will no tests. It will be ready around June. But, and maybe there will be one or two month delays. So I sent 2024 can be more conservative estimation.\n\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Super helpful. Alright. Hey, everybody. Thanks for the time, and have a great day.\n\nJihan Wu: Thank you, Greg.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Todaro: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question and the all the extra hash, bro. I guess, can we just get a bit more color on Clarrington? Like, do you need litigation results before signing an HPC customer there? You view that differently. Maybe any guardrails on timeline there? And then I have a follow-up on the mining piece.\n\nHaris Basit: So because it is litigation, we have to be sort of, you know, more careful in what we say here. You know, our attorneys feel very strongly that we have a very good case here, and the litigation has little merit, and we will, you know, prevail here. And on the business side, we are, you know, exploring alternative that can mitigate the impact of the litigation. I do not really want to say a lot more than that. You know, as we said in our scripted remarks, we do anticipate that there will be, you know, some potential delay. But, you know, we are still confident in the site overall.\n\nBut it is early days, and we, you know, we are looking at some significant alternatives.\n\nJihan Wu: Yeah. I think the alternative, alternative here, we have multiple alternative options. Creating alternative options is to solve those problems. I believe it is very critical solving those problems. And at a company level, Clarrington, Rockdale, and our lower chin size, we would be able to have lots of alternatives. Other than Carrington. This is the company level. And under the Clariton level, we believe we have several solutions. So I do not think that we are really caught at this kind of litigation.\n\nJohn Todaro: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then on the that latest tape out for the Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, do you anticipate mining some of these other assets? Alongside Bitcoin? And maybe I was looking at some of the margin profile. It looks like there is still some margin there. But maybe the opportunity in those as well.\n\nJihan Wu: Well, I think 99% or 98% will still be Bitcoin mining. This autochrome mining operations cannot really be scalable very much due to the market cap. So we count into a very small size operations. But on those, on those capacity, we deploy those manual rates yield out of from those capacity will be significantly improved. So I think it is worth the effort to add some, add some. And then, by the way, this is our first b commanding chip and the manual machines that are designed and manufactured totally depends on our Singapore and the Malaysia office. And the Malaysia operation as well. Malaysia operation, we started to build since last year or earlier.\n\nI think that this product, it also means that our supply chain center in Malaysia has been quite mature. So Malaysia and Vietnam, we will have two supply chain center. For companies. Think it is very strategic and important for the resilience of our business in the future.\n\nHaris Basit: Understood. That is helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Thanks, John.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Knoblauch of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\n\nBrett Knoblauch: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe now that we are several weeks into the year, I am curious if you have any insights into what wafer allocation is going to look like this year compared to last year? And on the back of that, with Bitcoin price coming down, network cash staying resilient, hash price going to kind of near all-time lows, does that, you know, more incentivize you guys to use manufacturing capacity for, call it, internal use rather than sell external? Or how should we kind of look at the split between what you guys manufacture for yourselves Versus sell this year? Thank you.\n\nJihan Wu: We cannot tell the exact number or situation with the different allocation, but we have a really good relationships. And even though the we all know that the demand for AI business is huge, several times. Then take them to rehab, but we will get some co coda from additional capacity. And the hash price drops to historically due now recently. And it became very difficult for sending the money works with profit. But we have our own capacities or electricity cost is one of the lowest on the market. And our CapEx, so perhaps combined together, we are the lowest on the market.\n\nSo our self money definitely became kind of very defensive, very safe strategy for our companies to make sure that even though in this kind of environment, our Bitcoin mining operations will be profitable. So self deployment will be a very important strategy in 2006, especially in the kind of a very bearish marketplace. I think our market share for the Bitcoin mining output will continue to grow. Into something.\n\nHaris Basit: Perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl of Northland. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Grondahl: Hey, thank you. Hey, Haris, I just wanted to ask, on the November call, there was a significant emphasis on, you know, GPU rental, and that is what Bitdeer Technologies Group wanted to do. And now it seems like you are adjusting that a little bit on some of the larger sites, you know, colocation. Can you just talk about pivot away or why you are seemingly deemphasizing GPU rental at some of those large sites?\n\nHaris Basit: Maybe, Jihan, do you want to do that answer first, and then I can chime in if there is still.\n\nJihan Wu: Yes. I as an on the very live site, colocation is kind of very natural and good choice for a company. And for GPU rental, we have a smaller size Washington State and Tennessee State. We can absolutely handle that ourselves. And maybe a larger capacitors for a lot of interest is besides, like, 10 megawatts or 50 megawatts. They want the nitrocytes anyway, and the nitrocytes in before company better to have some coefficient deal.\n\nHaris Basit: Do you have another question, Mike?\n\nMike Grondahl: No. So hey. Just so I understand, you have just sort of the larger sites, you will go colocation. The smaller ones, you go GPU rental. I guess that was kinda my takeaway. Is that fair?\n\nHaris Basit: Yes. That is correct. Got it.\n\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line Steven Glagola of KBW. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Glagola: Hey, thanks for the question. I have two. First for Haris. I would like to clarify whether Bitdeer Technologies Group’s US AI cloud expansion and potential expansion in Washington and Tennessee is dependent on securing multiyear reserve capacity agreements? And if so, one of those commitments would primarily be for bare metal deployments. That is one. And then second, for Jihan and Matt, you know, it would be helpful to hear your perspective on why USA cloud expansion is strategically attractive at this stage. You know, how do you think about sort of long-term competitive advantages in AI cloud as you broaden beyond your current Asia-centric footprint? Thank you.\n\nHaris Basit: So the first part, our expansion of GPU in the United States is dependent on, you know, signing contracts, at least any significant large-scale expansion is. You know, we can speculatively do small expansion in the United States. But as we said in the statement, anything significant would be backed by contracts.\n\nJihan Wu: And we have our own data centers. I think that is very important advantage right now in the US market. Means that under the end of this year, we will be able to deploy the H300 and about rubings with our own data centers. In the United States right now is the center of AI innovation globally. The demand in US market is so much stronger than any other market. And also the US customers also just one. Capacity on US soil. So we have this kind of capacity in US. And we are going to build it, and then we can build it. We will finish it.\n\nI think this will be the most important advantage on the market right now.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

      "Content": "Revenue surged 225.8% YoY to $224.8 million in Q4 2025, but gross profit fell to $10.6 million (4.7% margin) as a ~13% lower average Bitcoin price, higher electricity costs and a shift to a three‑year depreciation schedule materially pressured profitability.\n\nBitdeer is rapidly scaling self‑mining and hardware: self‑mining revenue hit $168.6 million, the company exited 2025 with >55 EH/s and topped >63 EH/s in January, began mass production of SEALMINER A3 and plans SEAL04‑1 volume production in Q1 2026 (SEAL‑DL1 Litecoin chip taped out).\n\nThe firm is pivoting toward AI/HPC colocation and GPU-as-a-Service with 1.66 GW online and a 3 GW pipeline (key sites Tydal, Clarington, Rockdale), while reporting heavy cash use (net operating cash outflow $599.5 million), ~$1.0 billion of borrowings and a switch to GAAP reporting in Q1 2026.\n\nInterested in Bitdeer Technologies Group? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\n4 Blockchain Stocks That Aren’t Coinbase\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported fourth-quarter 2025 revenue of $224.8 million, up 225.8% year over year and 32.5% sequentially, as the company highlighted continued scale-up in self-mining and growing focus on AI and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure opportunities. Management described the quarter as a period of “execution and strategic progress” as Bitdeer positions itself as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Bitdeer posted gross profit of $10.6 million, representing a gross margin of 4.7%, down from 24.1% in the third quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.2 million, compared with $39.6 million in the prior quarter and negative $4.3 million in Q4 2024.\n\n→ Once Upon A Farm: Buy the $1B Growth Story?\n\nBeyond the Halving: The Future of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nChief Strategy Officer Haris Basit said the sequential decline in profitability primarily reflected a 13% lower average Bitcoin price versus Q3 2025, a roughly 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit driven mainly by winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites, and “substantially higher depreciation expense” tied to rapid expansion of self-mining capacity. The company also increased headcount to support mining operations and AI/HPC initiatives and incurred higher year-end compensation and corporate activity costs.\n\nBitdeer also changed its depreciation methodology to a more conservative approach, moving to a three-year straight-line method for mining rigs compared with a prior five-year useful life assumption, which contributed to higher depreciation expense.\n\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nSelf-mining revenue was $168.6 million, up from $41.5 million in Q4 2024 and $130.9 million in Q3 2025. Management attributed the quarter-over-quarter increase to a higher average operating hash rate and Bitcoin production, partially offset by lower Bitcoin prices and a gradual rise in global network hash rate.\n\nBitdeer also reported $23.4 million in SEALMINER sales revenue, up 105.4% from $11.4 million in Q3 2025.\n\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\n\nOn fleet expansion, Basit said Bitdeer exited 2025 with more than 55 exahash per second (EH/s) of self-mining hash rate and added another 8 EH/s in January, exiting the month at more than 63 EH/s. As of January 31, 2026, overall fleet efficiency stood at 17.5 joules per terahash, with SEALMINER A2 and A3 rigs operating at approximately 15–16.5 J/TH and 12.5–14 J/TH, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bitdeer commenced mass production of the SEALMINER A3 series, with initial shipments beginning in November and 8.7 EH/s deployed to date. Basit said mass production of rigs based on the SEAL04-1 chip is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026, while SEAL04-2 remains under development at the company’s U.S.-based design center. Bitdeer also announced it taped out a Litecoin chip (SEAL-DL1) designed for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, with initial test results said to exceed comparable rigs in energy efficiency and hash rate. CEO Jihan Wu noted the company expects “99% or 98%” of operations to remain Bitcoin-focused, while adding that small-scale altcoin mining could improve yields on certain capacity.\n\nIn Q&A, management said there is a Bitcoin price level that could prompt the company to slow mining activity, but it “hasn’t reached it yet,” adding that higher-efficiency portions of the fleet could operate through further price declines while older machines would be turned off first.\n\nBitdeer emphasized progress on its global power and infrastructure footprint. Basit said the company had more than 1.66 gigawatts (GW) of capacity online at the end of January and a total global power pipeline of 3 GW. Management said it is prioritizing colocation services at AI-suitable sites in Norway and the U.S., reflecting increased demand for large-scale colocation capacity.\n\nKey site updates included:\n\nTydal, Norway: A 225-megawatt facility built to Tier 3 data center specifications. Basit said retrofit capex should be lower than typical greenfield Tier 3 development benchmarks of $8 million to $12 million per MW. The site uses hydropower and includes independent 100 MW transformers for redundancy. Management said it is in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expects to be able to announce a signed lease “as soon as possible in 2026,” though timing is difficult to predict. In Q&A, Basit said estimated PUE is around 1.1, citing hydropower, cold climate, and chilled water availability from a nearby lake. He added the company expects completion of the Tydal site by the end of the year, with production GPU installation at the beginning of next year.\n\nClarington (U.S.): A 570-megawatt site where the local utility has accelerated the interconnection timeline, and the company is in discussions with “well recognizable companies” as prospective tenants. Management disclosed litigation has been filed that could delay development, but said it believes it has a strong defense and is exploring alternatives to mitigate impact.\n\nRockdale (Texas): Bitdeer said it is evaluating acquisition of adjacent land to develop greenfield HPC capacity while maintaining its existing 563 MW Bitcoin mining operation. Management said it believes expected additional capacity of up to 179 MW should not be affected by recent ERCOT discussions, though regulations remain under discussion.\n\nWu characterized the company’s approach as using colocation for very large sites while pursuing GPU-as-a-Service for smaller sites such as Washington State and Tennessee/Knoxville, where Bitdeer believes it can manage deployments directly.\n\nBitdeer said it continues to see opportunities for GPU-as-a-Service in targeted markets and is expanding its cloud platform in Malaysia by 10–15 MW, building on activity in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming. In the U.S., the company plans to add 10 MW of GPU capacity in Washington State and is evaluating a partial conversion of its Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud.\n\nManagement stressed that significant U.S. GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customer contracts and that it does not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. In response to an analyst question, Basit reiterated that major U.S. AI cloud expansion is dependent on signing contracts.\n\nOn Malaysia, management said the infrastructure is being leased. Wu added the timeline to deploy GPUs depends on infrastructure readiness, noting it was expected around June but that delays are common; he suggested Q3 or Q4 as a more conservative estimate.\n\nBitdeer reported net cash used for operating activities of $599.5 million, which management said was primarily driven by SEALMINER supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs, corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97.9 million, including $50.7 million of capital expenditures and $150.6 million in proceeds from cryptocurrency disposals. Net cash generated from financing activities was $454.5 million, driven mainly by $388.5 million of proceeds from convertible senior notes, $168 million in related-party borrowings, and $141.5 million of proceeds from shares sold under its ATM and ELOC program, partially offset by $171.1 million in repayments.\n\nOn the balance sheet, Bitdeer ended the year with $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $83.1 million in cryptocurrencies held at cost less impairment, $135.6 million in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1.0 billion in borrowings, excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities tied to convertible senior notes were $501.1 million, which management said reflected non-cash fair value adjustments and did not impact liquidity or operations.\n\nFor capital spending, Bitdeer said full-year 2025 infrastructure capex totaled $176 million. For 2026, it anticipates $180 million to $200 million of infrastructure spend for crypto mining data center construction, excluding capex for SEALMINERS, GPUs, AI cloud, and colocation.\n\nBasit also noted the company will begin using GAAP instead of IFRS starting in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:BTDR) is a global digital asset mining and computing services provider focused on delivering secure and efficient hashrate solutions to institutional and retail customers. The company leverages its proprietary mining platform to offer hosted mining, hashrate sales and management services, enabling clients to access large-scale mining operations without direct investment in hardware or infrastructure.\n\nBitdeer’s core offerings include mining hosting services, whereby the firm installs, operates and maintains specialized mining equipment on behalf of customers, and hashrate-as-a-service products that provide fixed-capacity mining power with transparent pricing structures.\n\nThe article \" Bitdeer Technologies Group Q4 Earnings Call Highlights \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

Sign up now!\n\nLumentum Holdings is an optical and photonic products company based in San Jose, California, that provides products to the cloud, networking, and industrial sectors. The company, which has a market capitalization of around $40.1 billion and an enterprise value of $42.1 billion, has clearly established itself as a “mission critical” supplier to the buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe stock has seen an explosive move over the last year, trading at $556, with a 52-week range of $45.65-$599.50. The stock has seen an increase of over 600% in weighted alpha, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX). Relative strength is sitting at 74.39, which highlights the stock’s strong performance.\n\nThe stock’s valuation has clearly expanded with the move, and investors seem willing to pay the premium to own this stock as it relates to next-generation artificial intelligence networking infrastructure growth. The stock has seen over 94% of institutional ownership, with a short float of 15.8%.\n\nThe company does not pay a dividend, as it is choosing to reinvest the money into further capacity expansion and next-generation product development.\n\nLumentum’s fiscal second quarter 2026 results were a significant turning point for the company. Revenue was $665.5 million, up considerably from $402.2 million in the year-ago period. Moreover, Lumentum’s GAAP diluted EPS was $0.89, whereas its non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.67, compared with $0.42 in the year-ago period. Lumentum’s margins also improved considerably. GAAP gross margin was 36.1%, while its non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up considerably from the year-ago period.\n\nWhat is more surprising is the fact that Lumentum’s non-GAAP operating margin was 25.2%, an increase of more than 1,700 points from the year-ago period. It appears the company is entering a new era of high volume and high value related to AI optical demand. Lumentum has identified two significant opportunities in the market, which are optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\n\nLumentum’s backlog for OCS is more than $400 million, whereas the company has announced a multi-hundred-million-dollar CPO order, which is due for the first half of calendar year 2027. Moreover, GF Securities has announced that Nvidia’s supply chain is expected to start ramping up in the second quarter of 2026, with acceleration in the second half of 2026 and into 2027.\n\nAnalysts hold positive expectations towards the stock with a “Strong Buy” rating consensus for LITE; however, the current price targets don't quite factor in the stock’s recent run-up. The stock’s current mean target price is $525.11, which it has already surpassed, and it has a high price target of $600 and a low price target of $420.\n\nConsidering the stock’s recent price of around $556, the stock’s mean price target of $525.11 translates into a potential downside of around 5.6%. However, the stock’s street-high price target of $600 implies a potential upside of around 7.9% if AI networking demand continues to surprise on the upside.",

O’Malley wrote that ADI has “the most leverage to Industrial exposure,” making it the most attractive way to position for an upturn.\n\nBy contrast, Barclays initiated Microchip at Equal Weight, noting the company is exposed to networking and memory demand from AI data-center buildouts but faces challenges including “a difficult spot from a leverage perspective” and “share loss in low end MCUs.”\n\nThe bank assigned the stock an $80 price target.\n\nBarclays also started coverage of ON Semiconductor at Equal Weight with a $75 target, citing upside from rising data-center dollar content in the move to 800-volt architectures.\n\nHowever, O’Malley said the stock cannot “break out” without a broader recovery in auto demand, which “remains mum for foreseeable future.”\n\nBarclays added that each company in the group faces at least one industry-specific challenge, reinforcing its preference for ADI’s mix of industrial leverage and balance-sheet strength.",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marvell-technology-inc-mrvl-trending-140005205.html",
      "Content": "Marvell Technology (MRVL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Marvell belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMarvell is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +80.9%. This estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.51 indicates a change of +23.6% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.18 billion and $10.04 billion estimates indicate +41.9% and +22.7% changes, respectively.\n\nMarvell reported revenues of $2.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Marvell surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMarvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Monolithic Power (MPWR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MPWR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Monolithic Power's main business drivers.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems, based in Kirkland, WA, designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions. The company focuses on the market for high-performance analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs).\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s products are widely used in industrial applications, telecommunications infrastructure, cloud computing, and automotive and consumer applications.\n\nBeing a fabless company, Monolithic works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the designing and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost.\n\nUnlike other fabless semiconductor companies, Monolithic installs its own proprietary process technologies in third-party contractors&rsquo; equipment and facilities.\n\nMonolithic reported total revenues of $751.15 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company&rsquo;s key product families are direct current to direct current (DC to DC) products and Lighting Control products.\n\nDC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and monitors, automobiles and medical equipment.\n\nLighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products.\n\nBy end market, 21.5% of total revenues came from Storage and Computing in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nEnterprise Data, Consumer, Industrial, Automotive and Communications end-markets contributed 31%, 8.8%, 7.2%, 20.1% and 11.14%, respectively, to the fourth quarter of 2025 revenues.\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s primary competitors are Skyworks Solutions, Microchip Technology, Lattice Semiconductor, IPG Photonics, Power Integrations, Cree, Semtech, Micron Technology, Analog Devices, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES.\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Monolithic Power, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in February 2016 would be worth $21,271.42, or a 2,027.14% gain, as of February 12, 2026, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 279.51% and the price of gold increased 292.77% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MPWR.\n\nMonolithic reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It has a strong growth opportunity due to its robust product portfolio that targets In-Car connectivity and infotainment, advanced driver assistance system and rapid adoption of LED lightings in cars and vehicles. Being a fabless company, MPWR works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the design and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost. However, MPWR faces challenges due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards and short product life-cycles are other challenges.\n\nThe stock is up 21.67% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2026. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.",

      "Content": "Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.73 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.14. This compares to a loss of $3.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -430.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.28, delivering a surprise of -481.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nBITDEER TEC GRP, which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $224.84 million for the quarter ended December 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $69.02 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nBITDEER TEC GRP shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.4%.\n\nWhile BITDEER TEC GRP has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for BITDEER TEC GRP was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.16 on $203.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.15 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Cricut, Inc. (CRCT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2025. The results are expected to be released on March 3.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nCricut, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $198.69 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "（中央社記者張建中新竹2026年2月12日電）彩色濾光膜及微透鏡廠采鈺 (6789) 今天表示，受農曆年節工作天數較少影響，第1季營收將較2025年第4季略減，2026年上半年毛利率應可較2025年下半年提升。\n采鈺下午舉行線上法人說明會，公布2025年第4季營運結果。受惠手機影像感測器出貨穩定成長，加上有利的匯率走向，采鈺第4季營收新台幣22.88億元，季增1.4%。\n因產能利用率持穩，以及匯率的幫助，采鈺2025年第4季毛利率攀升至26.6%，較第3季揚升1.8個百分點，稅後淨利3.85億元，季增11%，每股純益1.21元。\n采鈺2025年因微型光學元件需求放緩及不利匯率波動影響，總營收降至89.38億元，年減11%，隨著產品組合變化，以及匯率影響，毛利率降至24.7%，下滑5.8個百分點，稅後淨利12.74億元，每股純益4.01元。采鈺董事會決議每股配發3元現金股利。\n展望未來，采鈺預期，影像感測器需求維持一定水準，微型光學元件表現溫和回升，由於第1季適逢農曆年節工作天數較少，2026年第1季營收將較2025年第4季略減，較2025同期略增，年增幅度為1%至3%，上半年也可望較2025年上半年小幅度增加。\n采鈺表示，毛利率主要受產品組合、產能利用率、固定成本、折舊費用以及匯率變化影響，預期2026年上半年產能利用率穩定提升，加上折舊金額下降，假設匯率沒有明顯變化，2026年上半年毛利率和營業淨利將較2025年年下半年提升。\n至於資本支出，采鈺指出，2025年實際資本支出約6000萬美元，其中近9成投入製造和研發所需設備，其餘為一般性設備及產物設施的支出。\n采鈺表示，2026年資本支出預計為7000萬美元，主要用於購置部分影像感測器設備，解決生產瓶頸，以及繼續龍潭廠二期無塵室的建設，另外將視需求購買部分研發製程用機台。",

      "Content": "We recently published 10 Stocks Turning Heads With Double-Digit Returns . Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) was one of the best performers on Wednesday.\n\nGlobalfoundries jumped to an over one-year high on Wednesday, as investors gobbled up shares after the company swung to profitability last year, marking a 439 percent improvement year-on-year.\n\nIn an earnings call, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) said that it swung to a net income of $888 million in 2025 from a $262 million net loss in 2024. This came despite a mere 1 percent uptick in net revenues at $6.79 billion from $6.75 billion year-on-year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter alone, net income stood at $200 million, reversing a $729 million net loss in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues, however, were flat at $1.83 billion.\n\nFollowing the results, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) saw its intra-day share price on Wednesday jump to as much as $48.88 before trimming a few cents to finish the session just up by 16.32 percent at $48.74 apiece.\n\nIn other news, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) announced plans to buy back $500 million worth of its common shares in a bid to boost shareholder value.\n\nThe buyback may be implemented from time to time, through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions, among others.\n\nThe initiative will run for a period of 12 months and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at anytime.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GFS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "Lumentum ( LITE ) delivered a stellar beat-and-raise December quarter last week that has estimates soaring.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings of $1.67 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.68%, and were up nearly 300% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nNon-GAAP revenues of $665.5 million, which beat the consensus mark by 1.85%, increased 24.7% on a sequential basis and 65.5% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe growth showcases the strength of the company&rsquo;s plans for both optical components and systems in a world where NVIDIA ( NVDA ) is building next-gen GPU rack-scale datacenter architectures based on silicon photonics connectivity, switching, and networking.\n\nProduct-wise, revenues from the Components segment contributed 66.7% to total revenues in the fiscal second quarter. The figure increased 68.3% year over year to $443.7 million. System revenues contributed 33.3% to total revenues. The figure increased 60.1% year over year to $221.8 million.\n\nLITE Q3 2026 Guidance Ignites Estimates\n\nFor Q3 fiscal 2026 (ends March), LITE expects non-GAAP revenues between $780 and $830 million vs a prior consensus closer to $700 million. The company expects non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 30% to 31%, vs expectations of 22%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings between $2.15 and $2.35 per share, vs a prior consensus under $1.60.\n\nAnd if any investor or analyst was wondering if this blistering pace was going to slow down any time soon, management said this during the conference call...\n\n&ldquo;Our forward guidance calls for over 85% year-over-year revenue growth, yet we are only at the starting line for two substantial opportunities: optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\"\n\nAnd analysts are already reflecting this optimism in Q4 FY'26 (ends June) with projected growth of 87.5% to $900 million.\n\nThe full-year 2026 sales consensus moved to $2.9 billion, representing over 76% annual growth. And FY'27 is already projected to come in near $4.7 billion, for a 61.5% advance.\n\nAs you would expect, these sales ramps, combined with improving margins, are driving the bottom line estimates higher for both this year and next.\n\nA month ago, the FY26 EPS consensus was at $5.67 and FY27 at $8.29. Today they stand at $7.63 and $14.11, representing growth of 270% and 85%, respectively.\n\nHow NVIDIA Ignited Demand for Optical Interconnect\n\nI'll admit: I was late to the optical party. And I should not have been since I follow NVIDIA so closely. Lessons learned. In December, I profiled Lumentum optical peer Coherent ( COHR ). Here's what I wrote...\n\nWe know NVIDIA is a big customer of Credo Technology ( CRDO ) AECs because CEO Jensen Huang is a big fan of copper for connecting GPUs within rack-scale architectures and Credo has repeatedly showcased its AECs in live demonstrations at the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference (GTC). These demos feature Credo's AECs connecting servers and switches directly to NVIDIA H100 GPUs to create disaggregated, rack-scale GPU clusters.\n\nBut at GTC in March [2025], Jensen announced a collaboration with a purely optical player, Coherent.\n\nOne big driver of investor enthusiasm that helped drive COHR shares from below $70 to over $190 this year was their collaboration with NVIDIA announced at GTC in March.\n\nCoherent and NVIDIA will develop silicon photonics networking switches using co-packaged optics (CPO). This ecosystem will allow AI factories to connect millions of GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA still uses copper wiring within Blackwell NVL72 rack-scale systems to connect GPUs to each other, but to \"scale out\" across the datacenter Jensen Huang recognized the power and speed of optical solutions to connect many racks together for the lowest latency.\n\nThus NVIDIA has several connectivity and networking systems that use optical and photonics solutions and they can be categorized into two main areas: Interconnect Products, including Infiniband and Ethernet protocols, and the upcoming Co-Packaged Optics, like Spectrum-X Photonics Switches.\n\nLITE and TSMC: Co-Design for the Win\n\nLumentum and Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ), aka TSMC, aka THE advanced chip foundry, are two of the most critical \"ingredient\" partners in NVIDIA's move toward Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).\n\nTheir collaboration solves a massive physics problem: as AI clusters grow to millions of GPUs, traditional copper wiring and pluggable transceivers consume too much power and generate too much heat.\n\nBy moving optics into the chip package, they reduce power consumption by roughly 3.5x and increase signal integrity significantly. Here is how they work together to build this for NVIDIA's next-gen platforms like Quantum-X and Spectrum-X.\n\nBut TSMC has to provide the \"packaging\" that allows electricity and light to live on the same chip. A major challenge with CPO is that lasers are heat-sensitive. If you put a laser directly next to a hot GPU or Switch ASIC, it will fail.\n\nTSMC&rsquo;s Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) is a 3D packaging process. It allows NVIDIA to stack the Electrical IC (the brain) directly on top of the Photonic IC (the eyes).\n\nMe and the Analysts: Won't Get Fooled Again\n\nAfter I understood this integrated circuit of interdependency, I finally bought Lumentum shares in January at $350 on the pullback from $400. Most analysts were still too timid with estimates and the high price targets were only calling for $450. Heck, Morgan Stanley thought $350 was fair!\n\nAfter earnings, LITE could only manage to kiss $500 and retreat. So I sold some of my position at $485, thinking it may have gone too far, too fast.\n\nIn retrospect, I was foolish to ever doubt the risk appetite for Lumentum (LITE) based solely on the weak reception for its stellar report that day.\n\nAnd it should have been obvious as soon as the next day when everything was falling out of bed on Feb 5 because LITE tested the silly post-earnings low at $426 and reversed higher with a big fat engulfing candle to close above $500!\n\nThen Friday, as the upgrades and delayed reactions poured in, she gaps up to $540 and closes above $550.\n\nThey almost got me again with two kisses of $600 on Monday and Wednesday this week, and then another about-face. But I'm not falling for it this time.\n\nI'm holding my shares for the full realization of what NVIDIA (NVDA) is building for the next five years, where optical components are required at multiple stages and optical providers like LITE and Coherent (COHR) can be involved at different stages of design and fabrication with CPO.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the Street herd gathering around $550 with their PTs...\n\nRosenblatt $580\nJP Morgan $565\nCiti $560\nNeedam $550\nSusquehanna $550\nB. Riley $526\nMizuho $525\nBofA $520\nStifel $480\nBarclays $475 (Equal-Weight)\nUBS $455 (from $215! and stays at Neutral)\n\nSee ya next quarter when Lumentum surprises again and they raise their PTs to $650.\n\nDisclosure: I own NVDA, TSM, CRDO, and LITE shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nKevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks where he runs the TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】智原（3035）2026年迎拐點，總經理王國雍直指將是「結構性成長」起點；儘管首季營運相對谷底、營收估季減約1成，但AI專案、先進封裝量產啟動，及晶圓代工夥伴策略發酵下，全年營收可望呈低雙位數成長，且毛利率維持40％以上。智原並以「IP＋ASIC」雙軸布局，卡位先進製程與高階封裝供應鏈，在AI資源排擠與產能瓶頸的新常態中搶得新案。\n智原2025年的營運表現不俗，NRE（委託設計）合併營收達22.9億元，創歷史新高、亦連五年成長；量產營收141.8億元、年增96％，同步刷新歷史紀錄，每股稅後純益（EPS）2.81元。王國雍分析，整體業務結構已經出現質變，先進製程與高階封裝成為主要的成長動能。\n他進一步指出，2025年智原取得5個Design Win，最先進製程為三星4奈米；先進封裝亦拿下10個Design Win，且多數專案今年量產，貢獻大量營收。預估第一季為今年營運谷底，但短期波動不改長線成長，需求將呈「季季成長」，尤以第四季貢獻最顯著。\n智原將AI視為核心驅動力，預估今年AI相關營收占比將上看3成。AI應用拆解為雲端、邊緣與端點三層，王國雍表示，智原並非只押注CSP（雲端服務供應商）通用型模型，也聚焦於專用型AI、及邊緣AI等差異化市場；如公司在邊緣AI已完成多項整合NPU（神經網路處理器）的設計，滿足客戶在本地推論之需求。\n值得關注的是，智原將「IP先行、ASIC接棒」作為今年的另一主軸。王國雍透露，多家晶圓代工夥伴合作持續深化，包括Intel 18A／18AP專案將持續推進，並由Intel協助引薦客戶；與聯電合作的12奈米布局，IP貢獻可望率先顯現，公司看好今年IP營收將有機會挑戰歷史新高，從基礎IP延伸至功能性IP，強化設計的黏著度。\nASIC方面，智原目前掌握逾10個FinFET相關專案在設計中，預期今年下半年起逐步轉為量產收入，成為營收與獲利的接續動能。\n智原以多代工夥伴與封裝整合能力擴大客戶廣度，2026年有望迎新一輪成長循環。(新聞來源 : 工商時報一張珈睿／台北報導)",

      "Content": "智原（3035）2026年迎拐點，總經理王國雍直指將是「結構性成長」起點；儘管首季營運相對谷底、營收估季減約1成，但AI專案、先進封裝量產啟動，及晶圓代工夥伴策略發酵下，全年營收可望呈低雙位數成長，且毛利率維持40％以上。智原並以「IP＋ASIC」雙軸布局，卡位先進製程與高階封裝供應鏈，在AI資源排擠與產能瓶頸的新常態中搶得新案。\n智原2025年的營運表現不俗，NRE（委託設計）合併營收達22.9億元，創歷史新高、亦連五年成長；量產營收141.8億元、年增96％，同步刷新歷史紀錄，每股稅後純益（EPS）2.81元。王國雍分析，整體業務結構已經出現質變，先進製程與高階封裝成為主要的成長動能。\n他進一步指出，2025年智原取得5個Design Win，最先進製程為三星4奈米；先進封裝亦拿下10個Design Win，且多數專案今年量產，貢獻大量營收。預估第一季為今年營運谷底，但短期波動不改長線成長，需求將呈「季季成長」，尤以第四季貢獻最顯著。\n智原將AI視為核心驅動力，預估今年AI相關營收占比將上看3成。AI應用拆解為雲端、邊緣與端點三層，王國雍表示，智原並非只押注CSP（雲端服務供應商）通用型模型，也聚焦於專用型AI、及邊緣AI等差異化市場；如公司在邊緣AI已完成多項整合NPU（神經網路處理器）的設計，滿足客戶在本地推論之需求。\n值得關注的是，智原將「IP先行、ASIC接棒」作為今年的另一主軸。王國雍透露，多家晶圓代工夥伴合作持續深化，包括Intel 18A／18AP專案將持續推進，並由Intel協助引薦客戶；與聯電合作的12奈米布局，IP貢獻可望率先顯現，公司看好今年IP營收將有機會挑戰歷史新高，從基礎IP延伸至功能性IP，強化設計的黏著度。\nASIC方面，智原目前掌握逾10個FinFET相關專案在設計中，預期今年下半年起逐步轉為量產收入，成為營收與獲利的接續動能。\n智原以多代工夥伴與封裝整合能力擴大客戶廣度，2026年有望迎新一輪成長循環。",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kla-shares-drop-15-post-165700060.html",
      "Content": "KLA Corporation KLAC shares dropped 15.1% post second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Jan. 29. The plunge can be attributed to the company’s not-so-impressive guidance, as well as operational headwinds. KLA now expects third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $3.35 billion (+/- $150 million), reflecting a modestly weak product mix on a sequential basis. The guidance also reflects the rapidly escalating cost of DRAM chips used in KLA’s image processing computers that ship with its systems, thereby hurting gross margin. Increasing lead times of its products due to supply constraints and negative tariff impact, roughly 100 bps, are headwinds in the near term.\n\nSo, what should investors do with KLA shares? Let’s find out?\n\nKLA shares have jumped 90.6% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 23.1% and the Zacks Electronics-Miscellaneous Products industry’s appreciation of 37.4%. KLA is benefiting from its dominant process control market share, strong AI infrastructure investment and momentum in advanced packaging.\n\nThe company has outperformed peers, including Applied Materials AMAT, ASML Holding ASML and Axcelis Technologies ACLS, in the past year. Shares of Applied Materials, ASML Holding and Axcelis have returned 81.9%, 87% and 48.1%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKLA is benefiting from strong demand for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging, which is driving top-line growth. Advanced packaging revenues are expected to grow mid-to-high teens on a year-over-year basis in 2026. Strong investments in WFE and advanced packaging represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. Growth of advanced packaging supporting heterogeneous chip integration has become a new market for KLA, which is currently worth $11 billion and growing faster than core WFE.\n\nKLA’s robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. Process control accelerates time to results by resolving process integration challenges during the fab ramp-up phase to optimize time to market for a diverse mix of semiconductor designs.\n\nMoreover, the growing investment in custom silicon, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of unique device designs. This has put customers under pressure to deliver performance, volume and time to market, resulting in strong demand for advanced process control. This aids KLA’s prospects as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology and yield optimization solutions. This bodes well for KLAC’s top-line growth.\n\nKLAC expects the core WFE market to grow in the high single to low double digits in 2026, reaching the low $120 billion range, up from approximately $110 billion in 2025. The company expects the advanced packaging component of the market to grow at a similar rate to roughly $12 billion for a total market forecast in the mid-$130 billion range, an increase in the low double digits versus its forecast for 2025.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $36.58 per share, up 3% over the past 30 days and indicating 9.9% growth from 2025’s reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $13.39 billion, suggesting 10.1% growth from the 2025’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Corporation price-consensus-chart | KLA Corporation Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $9.12 per share, up 2.4% over the past 30 days and indicating 8.4% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $3.37 billion, suggesting 9.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nKLAC shares are trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), KLAC is trading at 33.83X, higher than the broader sector and peers. The broader sector is trading at 26.08X while Applied Materials and Axcelis trade at 32.21X and 20.17X, respectively. However, ASML is pricey with a P/E multiple of 41.48.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnically, KLA is currently trading above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKLA benefits from strong demand for advanced packaging despite increasing lead times and conservative guidance. Robust AI demand bodes well for KLAC’s prospects and justifies a premium valuation.\n\nKLA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which suggests that investors should start accumulating the stock right now as the dip offers a massive opportunity.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsem-tower-revises-model-higher-161800468.html",
      "Content": "By Lisa Thompson\n\nNASDAQ:TSEM\n\nREAD THE FULL TSEM RESEARCH REPORT\n\nAs demand exceeds capacity, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) has decided to accelerate its investment as it sees margins continue to expand from the sale of new products. It is adding another $270 in capex to the next two years of spending to expand capacity for RF infrastructure products as demand outstrips supply. While the company is limited as to how high it can raise prices, it is deemphasizing lower margin products as it ramps new high margin ones. High margin SiPh contributed $228 million in 2025, up from $106 million in revenues in 2024, and with this additional investment, the company plans to grow capacity to greater than 5x of the actual Q4 monthly silicon photonics wafer shipments, compared to the 3x target given during the Q3 call. Over 70% of the total SiPho capacity is either presently reserved or in the process of being reserved through 2028, backed with customer prepayment.\n\nFor Q1 2026, Tower guided to revenues of $412 million plus or minus 5%, which results in slightly accelerating year-over-year growth.\n\nAs of last night’s closing price, the company trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.3 EV to estimated sales for 2027. Since its low at $28.54 on April 4, 2025, the stock has rocketed 379%. TSEM trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.5 EV to estimated sales for 2027, higher than its peers, who trade at an average of 5.7x. However, if we look at the components of that average, we see they diverge, with SMIC and Taiwan Semiconductor averaging 8.4x, while slower-growing Global Foundries and United Microelectronics are at or under 3.0x. At 8.4xs, TSEM stock would be worth approximately $175 per share using 2027 revenues. To be conservative, we are raising our price target to $150 as TSEM works to reach those revenue numbers.\n\nQ4 2025 Results\n\nThe biggest revenue contribution in the quarter again came from RF infrastructure, surpassing RF Mobile. In Q4, RF Infrastructure grew 102% to $141 million, up from $107 million in Q3 2025, and showed growth of 81.3% for the year. SiPh was $95 million of that (including some NREs) for the quarter and grew 70%. For the year, SiPh contributed $228 million compared to $106 million the year before. The growth rates are accelerating as well as the percent contribution to total sales. As they become a bigger portion of total revenues, growth should continue to accelerate.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mrvl-declines-8-3-months-154800725.html",
      "Content": "Marvell Technology MRVL shares have lost 8.2% in the past three months, underperforming its Computer and Technology sector, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry and peers like Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Micron Technology MU.\n\nShares of Broadcom and NVIDIA have lost 4.2% and 2.7%, respectively, while Micron Technology shares have surged 52.4%. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry appreciated 2.7% in the same time frame compared with no change for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven this decline in a month, the question arises: Should investors buy, sell or hold the stock at present? Let’s dive deeper into the fundamentals and financials of the MRVL stock to answer this question.\n\nMarvell Technology’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 signals softer near-term growth. The company guided revenues of $2.2 billion (+/- 5%), representing just 21% year-over-year growth, a slowdown compared to recent quarters. The top line has been in a declining trend for the past three quarters.\n\nDespite strong demand for electro-optics, management expects data center revenues to grow 20% year over year in the fourth quarter, suggesting a decelerating growth rate in the past six quarters. One of the major reasons for this decelerating growth is the growing presence of players like Broadcom and Astera Labs in the AI connectivity space.\n\nBroadcom is strong in networking, data center, broadband, Wi-Fi, Ethernet PHYs and switches. In the communications segment, Broadcom mainly provides high-speed connectivity, optical or wireline networking equipment, cable or broadband IC portfolio, PCIe switch and retimer.\n\nMarvell Technology’s rapid expansion of its portfolio has helped it keep pace with the market trend. MRVL is developing a co-packaged copper system with a 2.5m direct attach cable and a Co-packaged optics switch system. The volume shipments of MRVL’s next-generation 200G per lane 1.6T PAM DSPs are also a tailwind.\n\nThe company recently launched the Golden Cable initiative to accelerate and expand the Active Electrical Cable ecosystem for faster deployment of AI infrastructure by cloud and hyperscaler customers. MRVL is also gaining from the adoption of scale-up switches that connect AI accelerators within and across racks, requiring multi-terabit bandwidth and ultra-low latency.\n\nThe rapid growth of AI workload and allied infrastructure has attracted multiple players in this space. Semiconductor giants, including Micron Technology and NVIDIA, are in the AI processing, networking and memory space. Besides semiconductor partners, MRVL has collaborated with Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nMicron Technology has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth. MRVL has collaborated with MU on HBM design and integration for AI compute platforms to provide a custom HBM compute architecture.\n\nThe growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures. Marvell Technology has partnered with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion technology into MRVL’s custom cloud-platform silicon solution.\n\nTogether with its deep expertise in the AI semiconductor space and strong partner base, the company is able to keep its operating costs low and grow its top line at the same time, hence benefiting from a high growth rate in the bottom line. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, non-GAAP operating expenses grew just 4% year over year, even as revenues climbed 37% year over year, showcasing disciplined cost management.\n\nThe consensus estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 81%. The estimate has remained unchanged for the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMRVL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/S) ratio of 6.87, well below the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry average of 8.4, indicating that the stock appears undervalued at current levels.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough MRVL’s top line is showing a declining growth rate, the company has been able to retain its earnings growth through prudent cost measures. Marvell Technology has strong long-term fundamentals supported by its strong foothold in the data center, deep AI portfolio and high-speed networking space. Considering these factors, we suggest investors retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock at present.

      "Content": "Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Gold.com GOLD as the Bull of the Day and Qualcomm QCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc.&rsquo;s MU .\n\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\n\nA recent pullback in Gold.com stock may be short-lived as gold prices have rebounded to new record highs of over $5,000 per ounce, as shown below, following a sharp pullback to around $4,400 per ounce earlier in the month.\n\nAmid an unprecedented commodity price boom for various precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s stock has been one of the market&rsquo;s top performers in 2026 so far, soaring nearly +90% through the first two months of the year and recently hitting a 52-week high of $66 a share.\n\nOffering a fully integrated alternative assets platform, sentiment continues to build for Gold.com&rsquo;s outlook after reporting impressive results for its fiscal second quarter last Thursday and attracting positive attention from analysts in the process.\n\nHeadquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and formerly known as A-Mark Precious Metals, Gold.com provides an array of precious metals, including minted gold bars, silver, platinum, and palladium, along with copper bullion and numismatic coins to wholesale and retail consumers.\n\nStrong Q2 Results & Strategic Expansion\n\nEnforcing the narrative that Gold.com is executing well, Q2 sales spiked 136% year over year to a quarterly record of $6.47 billion from $2.74 billion in the comparative quarter. Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\n\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\n\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\n\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\n\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\n\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\n\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\n\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nQualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\n\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\n\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\n\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\n\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\n\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\n\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\n\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\n\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\n\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\n\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nMicron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\n\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\n\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\n\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\n\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\n\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\n\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\n\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\n\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\n\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Investors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\n\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\n\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\n\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.",

      "Content": "Silicon Motion (SIMO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this chip company have returned +15.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Silicon Motion belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +90%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +25.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52.7%. This estimate has changed +21.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.93 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $299.65 million indicates a year-over-year change of +80%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.24 billion and $1.41 billion estimates indicate +39.5% and +14.2% changes, respectively.\n\nSilicon Motion reported revenues of $278.46 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +45.7%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $0.91 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $261.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.61%. The EPS surprise was -2.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Silicon Motion surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSilicon Motion is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "（中央社記者管瑞平苗栗縣2026年2月11日電）晶圓代工廠力積電 (6770) 將把苗栗銅鑼廠廠房及廠務設施出售給美國記憶體大廠美光（Micron），苗栗縣政府稅務局預估，此筆交易可望為縣內挹注契稅收入，將近新台幣1.18億元。\n力積電10日公告，董事會決議通過與美光簽署合約，將位於苗栗銅鑼的P5晶圓廠廠房及廠務設施（不含生產相關機器設備）賣予美光，交易總金額約16.79億美元、約新台幣528.4億元。\n苗栗縣政府稅務局今天告訴中央社，力積電與美光此項交易，不僅引發產業界關注，也可望為縣內挹注一筆可觀收入。\n稅務局表示，力積電銅鑼廠土地屬國有地（竹科管理局），出售案沒有土地增值稅問題，但會產生契稅及印花稅。印花稅較少，約是簽約金額的千分之一，契稅則按房屋移轉現值的6%計算。\n根據稅務局房屋稅科掌握，力積電銅鑼廠共6筆稅籍資料，假設全數出售，印花稅預估196萬元，但仍要視實際簽約金額而定，變數較大；至於契稅，根據房屋現值約19.65億元估算，契稅申報繳納金額約達1億1790萬元，堪稱單筆公司交易罕見高金額紀錄。\n稅務局房屋稅科科長吳文琳說，契稅收入8成會先撥給交易案所在地方公所，也就是銅鑼鄉公所，其餘2成入縣庫統籌分配，無論如何，對於苗栗地方財政都挹注一筆為數不小的稅收。",

      "Content": "（中央社記者江明晏台北2026年2月11日電）台股金蛇年亮麗封關，全年大漲達10080.3點。投顧統計蛇年漲幅前20大飆股，題材橫跨記憶體、PCB、生技醫療、半導體設備等族群，其中以記憶體與PCB表現最為突出；德宏 (5475) 以漲幅1269.75%高居榜首，為蛇年最大飆股，南亞科 (2408) 以823.59%居次。\n台股蛇年今天亮麗封關，在台積電 (2330) 衝上1900元大關再創新高下，推升指數終場大漲532.74點，以33605.71點作收，對照龍年封關點數23525.41點，全年大漲10080.3點，再創農曆年漲點新紀錄，金蛇年漲幅達42.84%。\n根據台新投顧提供的統計資訊，從漲幅排序觀察，德宏以驚人的1269.75%高居榜首，成為蛇年最大飆股；南亞科以823.59%居次，沛爾生醫-創 (6949) 漲幅758.23%排名第3。\n其後個股漲幅依序為華邦電 (2344) 635.19%、尖點 (8021) 533.39%、凱崴 (5498) 423.26%、旺宏 (2337) 413.02%、金居 (8358) 404.48%、精測 (6510) 397.21%、華東 (8110) 361.25%。\n漲幅第11至20名分別為竹陞科技 (6739) 333.92%、穎崴 (6515) 316.55%、IET-KY (4971) 為311.7%、群聯 (8299) 303.96%、威剛 (3260) 303.68%、博士旺 (3555) 290.32%、方土昶 (6265) 287.46%、金像電 (2368) 280.21%、宜鼎 (5289) 273.88%及勤誠 (8210) 273.46%。\n若進一步拆解族群結構，記憶體族群是本波最大贏家，南亞科、華邦電、旺宏、群聯、威剛及宜鼎全數入榜，漲幅在近3倍以上，反映DRAM與NAND Flash報價回升，加上AI伺服器、高效能運算（HPC）需求帶動高頻寬記憶體（HBM）與企業級儲存需求擴張，基本面與題材面同步加溫，推升股價強勢表態。\nPCB相關族群在金蛇年同樣氣勢如虹，德宏、尖點、金居、金像電等個股名列前段班，顯示AI伺服器、高速傳輸與高階交換器，帶動高階板材與高階銅箔需求升溫，相關上游材料與鑽孔製程廠同步受惠，成為市場資金布局重心。\n除記憶體與PCB外，半導體測試與設備族群也有所斬獲，精測、穎崴受惠高階晶片測試需求擴張，表現亮眼；IET-KY具備化合物半導體題材，在高速與光通訊應用帶動下吸引買盤；生技族群方面，沛爾生醫-創以逾7倍漲幅躋身前3名，顯示資金對新藥與醫材題材仍具高度想像空間。\n此外，伺服器機殼廠勤誠、特殊應用材料與設備相關個股如竹陞科技、博士旺、方土昶等，也在AI擴產與產能建置浪潮中受惠。\n整體而言，蛇年20大飆股不僅漲幅驚人，更呈現「AI驅動、記憶體領軍、PCB助攻」的結構性行情，顯示產業趨勢與資金動能交織下，台股多頭火力集中於具成長性與技術門檻的關鍵供應鏈。（編輯：張良知）",

      "Content": "AI與科技股近期缺乏明確主流題材帶領，再加上零售銷售表現較預期疲弱，市場靜待其他關鍵經濟數據出爐，使美股投資氣氛轉趨保守。道瓊指數上漲0.10%，連續三日創歷史收盤新高；那斯達克指數下跌0.59%，標普500指數下跌0.33%，費城半導體指數下跌0.68%。盤面上，零售數據疲弱拖累好市多與沃爾瑪走低，而AI財富管理工具題材引發市場重新評價，LPL Financial、嘉信理財等財富顧問股大跌逾7%，Alphabet因發債消息亦承壓；台積電ADR則延續強勢上漲1.83%，連三日創高，反映半導體族群基本面支撐仍在。\n亞股方面，區域市場整體維持偏多格局，日股因建國紀念日休市一天；韓股上漲0.99%，港股上漲0.31%，上證指數小漲，顯示資金情緒仍偏正向但追價力道略為不足。\n回到台股，今（11）日大盤迎向蛇年封關，在權值股帶動下強勢收高，加權指數大漲532.74點、收33,605.71點，再刷新歷史新高，成交金額6,757.96億元，周線同步收紅。權王台積電(2330)盤中一度衝上1925元歷史天價，終場收1915元，成為推升指數最關鍵力量；資金集中電子權值與AI供應鏈， 鴻海(2317) 、台達電(2308)、聯發科(2454)同步走揚，題材股方面 富喬(1815) 受納入MSCI小型指數激勵攻上漲停，記憶體族群放量強勢，電子、金融、傳產等輪動盤面熱度，也為蛇年全年行情合計萬點漲幅劃下亮眼句點。\n📝盤點熱門股：友達、旺宏、凱基台灣TOP50 今日熱門成交股方面，面板與記憶體族群成為資金集中焦點。面板族群受報價回溫與需求改善預期帶動，友達(2409)以492,733張居成交量冠軍，股價走揚反映市場資金積極卡位，群創(3481)同步走強，顯示面板景氣循環回升題材吸引買盤。記憶體族群則由旺宏(2337)領軍亮燈漲停，受惠記憶體族群反彈與市場題材催化帶動成交熱絡，力積電(6770)則呈現小跌，反映資金在族群內部輪動與獲利調節。\n此外，ETF標的凱基台灣TOP50(009816)上市數日依然成交活絡，顯示在指數高檔震盪下，部分資金轉向指數型商品布局。整體而言，成交量前五名以題材族群與資金輪動為主軸，封關日短線交易熱度明顯升溫。\n📌三大法人買賣超 三大法人今日合計買超574.95億元，其中外資大舉買超523.60億元，成為推升盤勢的主要動能；投信同步買超37.62億元，顯示內資資金持續偏多布局；自營商亦小幅加碼13.73億元。整體而言，三大法人同步站在買方，市場解讀資金回流訊號明確，也為盤面維持強勢提供支撐。\n✨本日議題股：玻纖布概念股 本日盤面聚焦玻纖布概念族群，在AI伺服器與高階PCB需求帶動下，市場資金全面點火，族群呈現齊揚走勢。其中 富喬(1815) 亮燈漲停並爆出大量，股價連四漲，成為盤面最強指標； 台玻(1802) 同步爆量攻上漲停，顯示市場對玻纖布報價與需求回溫高度期待。法人指出，隨著AI高速傳輸與高頻高速板需求持續升溫，低介電材料與高階玻纖布供給吃緊，帶動產業景氣循環回升；此外， 南亞(1303) ...... 點我看更多\n🐍蛇年封關： 台股在金蛇年期間大漲逾萬點，整體行情表現亮眼，統計顯示平均每位股民帳面獲利達246萬元，即便扣除權值龍頭 台積電(2330) 的影響，平均仍有約101萬元，反映AI與科技股帶動的全面性多頭行情。同時，台積電(2330)蛇年市值大增20兆元，平均每位股東帳面獲利高達1014萬元，凸顯「護國神山」對台股市值與投資報酬的關鍵推升力道。不過，面對長假變數，市場情緒呈現兩極，統計顯示...... 點我看更多\n👁️‍🗨️ 憶如犀利講 台北市長蔣萬安終於把輝達Nvidia順利留在台北士林北士科，今（11）日下午正式完成簽約，正式拍板也讓台灣人免淪國際笑話。蔣萬安開心宣布「台北就是輝達的家」，並再次證明台北的實力成為AI科技產業最強心臟。接著宣布實質「牛肉」，輝達將投入400億元資金與至少上萬的就業機會，意謂「錢潮與人潮都留在台北了」，將是繼內科及南港之後的「下一個明日之星」，鄉林董事長賴正鎰更直言比照內科及南港的新「富人生活圈」將成形，不僅是台積宅，台北料將迎來「輝達宅」粉紅泡泡。\n除了成功留下輝達免於「其他縣市首長覬覦」外，台北市民更關注的是與他們息息相關的房價，隨後房仲業紛紛透露，北士科周邊房價更是已炒到每坪140萬到150萬元以上，房市總司令都直言「蛋白區賣蛋黃價」風險高，但不少房仲還是看好士林、北投，包括洲美段開發，甚至整個捷運紅線延伸到淡水等都有機會，「北士科」鍍金房市效應捲土重來，要不是台股金蛇年已經封關，說不準士林建案相關營建股、士林三寶「資產股」又要漲一波。\n昨天台積電董事會除了公布股利外，備受關注的是員工分紅平均可拿264萬元，年成長三成以上。員工分紅加本薪破500萬元，股價今日更站上1900大關，令人萬分羨慕，不僅在人才吸引力攀頂，已取代IC設計公司成「台清交」畢業生首選外，更有網友熱議「台灣房價都台積電害的」，過去台積電設廠風潮帶動竹科、龍潭、南科、高雄等房價飆高，但隨著「台積電赴日美加速擴廠後」，科學園區宅去年「泡泡戳破」，出現劇烈回檔。\n但接下來全球市值第一大的輝達要進駐台北北士科，估增加上萬就業機會，鄉林董事南賴正鎰上午更樂觀，估未來五年有近2萬科技新貴人才湧入北士科就業，將加速擴大「城北科技富人生活圈」，高科技就業人口具備「高所得、高穩定度、長期自住」的特性，直言就像當年內科發展帶動了大直內湖與南港的房價，如今北士科一定也會複製此模式。而民眾對於輝達工程師、客戶們的期待，可能更高於台積電。接著不少專家已開始關心起北士科的「交通」、「學區」等問題，盼著市府要進一步協助解決，誰說蛋白區無法成為蛋黃區呢？就看黃仁勳AI「爸爸們」能否再發揮「點石成金」的「鈔」能力了。\n🔭重大財經事件展望 周二國際財經事件，先看美國市場將關注最新公布的上周初領與續領失業救濟金人數，作為評估就業市場韌性與聯準會政策路徑的重要觀察指標，同時思科財報亦是科技產業需求與企業資本支出動能的風向球，市場將聚焦網通與AI基礎建設相關訂單展望；歐洲、亞太區、港澳則暫無重量級數據公布。\n台灣市場方面，適逢農曆年前休市與封關，市場交投可能逐步降溫，資金布局轉向長假持股策略與節後行情預期；個股動態則聚焦法說會釋出的產業展望，其中 新唐(4919) 與 采鈺(6789) 法說內容，將成為觀察MCU與感測元件需求、車用與影像應用復甦動能的重要指標，相關供應鏈後續展望與庫存調整進度亦可能牽動短線股價表現。\n註：加權指數成交金額含盤後定價，不含零股、鉅額、拍賣及標購\n（核稿編輯：劉凱銘）",

      "Content": "Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Skyworks SWKS and RF Industries RFIL.\n\nIndustry: Electronics - Radio Frequency\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2847030/2-radio-frequency-stocks-to-watch-from-a-prospering-industry\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry participants like Skyworks and RF Industries are benefiting from the continued adoption of WiFi 7, as well as the rapid proliferation of the edge IoT, AI data centers and automotive electrification. The growing need for faster connections, low latency, and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots.\n\nThe democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry participants. Nevertheless, industry players are facing a challenging demand environment that has resulted in inventory buildup. Sluggish capital spending by telecom carriers has been a headwind. Industry participants are suffering from heightened global macroeconomic uncertainties. Weakness in end-markets like automotive, industrial and infrastructure has been concerning.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in the congested RF spectrum.\n\nThey serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n3 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF Industry\n\nAccelerated 5G Deployment Acts as a Tailwind : The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications look promising for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which is expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. The growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects.\n\nInnovation Opens up Business Avenues : The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects. RF Semiconductors are setting the pace for technology modernization by digitizing aspects like connectivity, healthcare, transport and defense.\n\nThe diversified utilization of RF Semiconductor products bodes well for the industry players. The evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects. The rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers. Industry participants are looking to address these challenges with a robust range of antenna-plexer portfolios utilizing the BAW technology.\n\nGrowing Adoption of Electric Vehicles Aids Prospects : Industry players are gaining from the increasing inclusion of their products in electric vehicles (EVs). The market for EVs is expected to expand fourfold by 2027.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #20, which places it in the top 8% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry&rsquo;s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&rsquo;s earnings estimates for 2026 have moved up by 7.4% since June 30, 2025.\n\nGiven the bright prospect, there are a few stocks worth watching in the industry. However, before we present the top industry picks, it is worth looking at the industry&rsquo;s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Lags S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry has underperformed the S&P 500 and its broader sector over the past year. The industry has declined 9.6% over this period against the S&P 500&rsquo;s return of 16.8% and the broader sector&rsquo;s appreciation of 21.8%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing the Semiconductors - Radio Frequency stocks, the industry is currently trading at 12.51X, lower than the S&P 500&rsquo;s 22.98X and the sector&rsquo;s 25.91X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.71X and as low as 7.89X, the median being 14.65X.\n\n2 Radio Frequency Stocks to Watch\n\nRF Industries : Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have moved up 111.8% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRF Industries benefits from growing adoption of its integrated solutions, with backlog increasing to $15.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. The company is gaining its footprint among wireless, aerospace, public safety and industrial OEM customers. RFIL&rsquo;s prospects ride on diversifying portfolio, customers and end markets, as well as an expanding partner base.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RFIL&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 earnings has increased 8 cents to 43 cents per share over the past 30 days.\n\nSkyworks : This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from positive momentum in demand signals and backlog improvement, especially in automotive electrification, edge IoT, and AI data centers. The growing adoption of Wi-Fi 7 and upcoming Wi-Fi 8 systems drives growth. Strong demand for RF content in real-time video, sensors and software-defined vehicles provides a boost to SWKS&rsquo; prospects.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenues between $875 million and $925 million. SWKS expects a roughly 20% decline in Mobile, while Broad markets are expected to remain flat sequentially but grow high single digits year over year.\n\nSkyworks shares have dropped 4.8% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SWKS&rsquo; fiscal 2026 earnings has increased 6.8% to $4.70 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "【時報-台北電】台股蛇年封關再創高峰，指數盤中衝上33707點、收盤以33605點寫下歷史新高，為全年行情畫下亮眼句點。權值股全面走強，台積電（2330）終場上漲15元收1915元，持續扮演多頭核心；鴻海（2317）、台達電（2308）、聯發科（2454）同步走高。資金輪動推升多頭氣勢，帶動大盤以強勢姿態封關。累計蛇年期間指數上漲逾萬點，創下歷來農曆年最大漲點紀錄，展現台股多頭動能與市場信心。今日外資(不含外資自營商)買超523.6006億元，為史上第八、今年第二；投信買超37.6245億元，自營商買超13.7273億元，三大法人買超574.95億元。\n外資接連二日買超金額皆超過500億，累計封關前三日買超達1328億元；投信連8買達406億元，自營商連3買148億元，三大法人用銀彈相挺台股紅盤日表現。\n原本市場擔心春節期間變數仍多，今早台股開盤表現相對平淡，小漲13.18點，不過權值股台積電（2330）續扮多頭指標，股價刷新歷史高點至1925元，帶動資金回流，電子、金融與傳產族群同步走揚。MSCI全球標準型指數季度調整出爐，富喬（1815）、尖點（8021）獲納入全球小型指數成分股，激勵股價強勢表現，富喬更攻上漲停。雖DRAM雙雄未入列MSCI，記憶體族群仍維持熱度，旺宏（2337）在補漲行情推升下放量漲停，股價創下98.5元新高，波段漲幅近1.5倍，顯示資金輪動動能延續。\n富邦投顧董事長陳奕光指出，AI基本面驅動上市櫃獲利成長，為台股創高最強底氣。不只AI行情火熱，接下來農曆年後MWC展將登場，太空衛星通訊可望成市場新一波關注焦點，搭配SpaceX持續擴大衛星發射規模，產業需求前景轉佳，相關射頻與雷射元件族群具備題材發酵空間，也值得投資人關注。（編輯：張嘉倚）",

      "Content": "【時報記者葉時安台北報導】華邦電(2344)去年第四季財報遜於預期，主因存貨回沖比預估少，而展望第一季產品價格，華邦電預估DRAM漲價幅度預估在30-40%，同樣視為略偏保守，評估為維護長期客戶關係，第二季整體價格仍有機會續漲，華邦電產能兩年賣光，營運看好至2027年，受惠價格高檔、訂單無虞，預估今年總位元出貨量年增100%，毛利率可望優於先前預期，華邦電也同步上調資本支出，產能今明年陸續開出。華邦電EPS表現，美系外資最新預估達12.97、17.5元。\n兩家美系中，其一重申正向不變，維持首選的增持評等，目標價至155元；另一家則從140元上修至167元。而本土法人也多數給予目標價至120-150元區間，其一更以「好的離譜」為評論，將目標價從170元升至200元大關。\n華邦電2026年的總位元出貨量預計將年增長100%，由於製程節點遷移，FLASH快閃記憶體出貨量將增加30–40%，與總FLASH晶圓產量僅年增1成。記憶體價格上，首季記憶體可望持續上漲，DRAM漲幅與第四季相似(30-40%)，幅度略偏保守，評估為維護長期客戶關係；NOR第二季漲幅亦優於預期。\nAI伺服器和資料中心需求正在成長，GB200需要120 NOR晶片，隨著新GPU的遷移，內容和密度會持續升級，然在主流記憶體廠商進一步縮減情況下，華邦電將在特殊記憶體領域受惠。\n華邦電將資本支出提高至新台幣421億元，DRAM產能主要將於2027年到位，FLASH預計第三季起陸續量產。華邦電宣布發行7.5億美元的歐洲央行債券，可能用於資本支出。\n華邦電後續毛利率可望超越前高，今明年EPS挑戰1個股本以上，華邦電去年下年擬配息0.5元，美系外資直言，前所未有的記憶體周期，相對低檔將是一個絕佳的進場時機。",

      "Content": "Entegris beat or hit guidance in Q4 with sales of $824 million (down 3% y/y, up 2% sequentially), a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.7% , and non‑GAAP EPS of $0.70 , while full‑year unit‑driven revenue rose about 2% and CapEx‑driven revenue fell ~ 7% .\n\nFree cash flow improved to $404 million (a 12.7% FCF margin) in 2025, CapEx was $299 million and is expected to decline to ~ $250 million in 2026, while net debt ended Q4 around $3.4 billion with net leverage at 3.8x and a target to get below 3.5x by end‑2026.\n\nManagement sees a more constructive 2026 backed by mid‑single‑digit industry MSI growth, > 20% NAND bit growth and node transitions (including 2nm) that should raise content per wafer, alongside POR wins at advanced nodes and a push to increase local‑for‑local Asia supply for China.\n\nInterested in Entegris, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nIndustrial Tech Crossovers: When Manufacturing Meets Innovation\n\nEntegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) reported fourth-quarter 2025 results that came in at the high end or above its guidance ranges, as management emphasized disciplined execution and early signs of a more constructive semiconductor backdrop heading into 2026.\n\nChief Executive Officer Dave Reeder said fourth-quarter revenue, gross margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, and non-GAAP EPS all landed at the high end or above guidance. For the full year, he said total revenue was approximately flat versus 2024 excluding divestitures, with “unit-driven” revenue up about 2% in 2025 and “CapEx-driven” revenue down 7% in line with reduced industry fab construction spending.\n\n→ 3 ETFs Designed to Survive the Next Market Crash\n\n5 Trends You Need to Know This Quarter\n\nChief Financial Officer Linda LaGorga said fourth-quarter sales were $824 million , down 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. GAAP gross margin was 43.8% , and non-GAAP gross margin was 44% , with the sequential improvement driven primarily by increased production volumes.\n\nLaGorga reported GAAP operating expenses of $256 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $188 million . Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7% of revenue, above guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.70 , which she said was above guidance.\n\n→ 3 Consumer Staples Stocks Breaking Out This Month\n\nChip Gear Maker Entegris Has Potential, But Is It Buyable Now?\n\nBy segment, LaGorga outlined:\n\nMaterial Solutions (MS): Q4 sales of $362 million , flat year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Sequential growth was driven primarily by advanced deposition materials, supported by demand for molybdenum (moly) deposition within NAND. Adjusted operating margin was 20.9% .\n\nAdvanced Purity Solutions (APS): Q4 sales of $465 million , down 5% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by fluid handling and FOUPs, partially offset by liquid filtration, which delivered “another record quarter.” Adjusted operating margin was 24.8% .\n\nFor 2025, LaGorga said free cash flow was $404 million , representing a 12.7% free cash flow margin, nearly a 300 basis point improvement year over year. She attributed the improvement to working capital execution, including accounts receivable and reduced year-over-year inventory growth.\n\n→ 2 Subscription Economy Winners That Still Dominate Their Niches\n\nCapital expenditures in 2025 were $299 million , about 9% of sales. Reeder added that Entegris has completed a multi-year manufacturing CapEx investment cycle that began in 2022 and expects 2026 CapEx to decline to $250 million , with longer-term CapEx returning to approximately 7% to 8% of sales.\n\nOn the balance sheet, LaGorga said Entegris paid down $150 million of term loan debt in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year. Gross debt ended the quarter at about $3.7 billion , with net debt of $3.4 billion . Net leverage ended 2025 at 3.8x , and management reiterated a target to reduce net leverage to below 3.5x by the end of 2026.\n\nReeder said the industry backdrop “appears more constructive” in 2026 and highlighted multiple areas that could support improvement versus 2025, including logic and memory node transitions, stronger industry MSI (wafer starts) growth, and a recovery in fab construction spending.\n\nManagement expects mid-single-digit industry MSI growth in 2026 and noted that about 75% of Entegris revenue is unit-driven and correlated to MSI. Reeder said advanced logic utilization is already near 100%, and he expects demand for 2-nanometer devices to meaningfully increase wafer output through 2026, benefiting Entegris through higher content per wafer and the company’s share positions at advanced nodes.\n\nIn memory, Reeder described NAND transitions from “low 250 layers” to about 300 layers and said next-generation DRAM and HBM products are expected to roll out in 2026. He said NAND bit growth is expected to exceed 20% in 2026, driven more by higher layer count than a major increase in MSI, and he expects a double-digit increase in NAND content per wafer tied to higher layer nodes and new materials such as moly and selective etch.\n\nFor CapEx-driven exposure, management said 25% of company revenue is tied to industry CapEx, with roughly two-thirds of that correlated to fab construction and one-third to wafer fab equipment (WFE). Reeder said fab construction spending is expected to grow modestly in 2026 after a high single-digit decline in 2025, while WFE is expected to deliver strong growth. He cautioned during Q&A that the timing of fab construction-related demand has been moving “pretty significantly month to month,” and he characterized the fab CapEx portion as a “wild card,” potentially more second-half weighted.\n\nReeder updated investors on four CEO priorities he first discussed last quarter:\n\nDeepening customer intimacy and securing positions of record (PORs): He said Entegris has secured strong POR positions at the most advanced logic nodes across product lines including CMP consumables, advanced deposition and implant materials, liquid purification/filtration, and wafer handling. He also cited traction in advanced memory (DRAM/HBM) and POR wins in next-generation NAND across deposition materials, CMP, and selective etch applications.\n\nImproving utilization and rationalizing the footprint: Reeder said the Taiwan facility continues to ramp, and the Colorado facility is expected to substantially complete key customer product qualifications in 2026. He also said Entegris exited its Chester, Pennsylvania facility in the fourth quarter and expects to rationalize at least one additional facility in the first half of 2026.\n\nImproving free cash flow: Reeder said free cash flow margin improved to 12.7% in 2025, in line with the company’s target, and that free cash flow is now incorporated into short- and long-term incentive plans.\n\nIncreasing local-for-local manufacturing (especially for China): Reeder said the company expects about 85% of China revenue in the first quarter to be supplied by Asia facilities, with the proportion increasing through 2026.\n\nOn China, management said China remained about 21% of sales in both 2024 and 2025, with dollars down slightly. Reeder said the company’s main obstacle in China is assuring supply, and he expects continued progress in qualifying more Asia-based manufacturing to support that market.\n\nReeder also said Entegris is rescheduling its Capital Markets Day from May to the fall due to the CFO transition, and he thanked LaGorga for her contributions.\n\nFor the first quarter, LaGorga guided sales of $785 million to $825 million , reflecting about a 4% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Gross margin is expected to be 44.5% to 45.5% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including about 100 basis points of benefit in Q1 from a change related to the useful lives of assets.\n\nShe guided EBITDA margin of 26.5% to 27.5% , GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.51 , and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.78 . For Q2, management expects sales to increase 1% to 3% sequentially from Q1, in line with normal seasonality.\n\nIn Q&A, management said gross margin has stabilized around the current range, with volume leverage, the Taiwan ramp, and facility rationalizations expected to support improvement as production increases.\n\nEntegris, Inc is a leading provider of advanced materials and process control solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. The company develops and supplies a broad portfolio of products designed to ensure purity and reliability throughout the manufacturing process, helping customers address critical contamination and yield challenges.\n\nEntegris's product offerings include high-purity chemicals and specialty materials, liquid and gas filtration and purification systems, and sophisticated wafer and chip handling solutions.\n\nThe article \" Entegris Q4 Earnings Call Highlights \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

A : David Reeder, CEO, explained that the industry backdrop for 2026 appears more constructive than in 2025. Entegris expects to benefit from node transitions in both logic and memory, which typically drive additional content per wafer. While CapEx was not favorable in 2025, it is expected to be more constructive in 2026, particularly in fab CapEx. The company is cautiously optimistic about achieving outperformance, contingent on the timing of node transitions and CapEx developments.\n\nQ : How should we think about the margin trajectory for 2026, given the guidance for Q1? A : Linda Lagorga, CFO, noted that gross margin has stabilized and is expected to improve with increased production volumes. The ramping of the Taiwan facility and rationalization of existing facilities are expected to contribute to margin improvement. The company is focused on volume leverage to drive margins, which will positively impact EBITDA.\n\nQ : What is the outlook for MSI (wafer starts) and CapEx for 2026? A : David Reeder, CEO, stated that MSI is expected to grow in the mid-single digits for 2026. CapEx is anticipated to be up modestly, with strong growth in WFE (wafer fab equipment) and a potential increase in fab construction CapEx in the second half of the year. The company is monitoring these factors closely as they impact revenue growth.\n\nQ : Can you provide an update on the competitive landscape in China and how Entegris is addressing it? A : David Reeder, CEO, emphasized that the fundamentals in China are similar to the rest of the world, focusing on yield and performance. Entegris is working to assure supply to Chinese customers by qualifying more manufacturing overseas, particularly in Asia. The company expects to supply approximately 85% of China revenue from regional facilities in Q1, with plans to increase this proportion through 2026.\n\nQ : How is Entegris positioned to benefit from the growth in AI and advanced packaging markets? A : David Reeder, CEO, highlighted that about 60% of Entegris' revenue comes from advanced nodes, with AI being a significant growth driver. The company is focusing on advanced packaging, which grew nicely in 2025 and is expected to continue growing in 2026. Entegris is making concerted efforts to expand its product lines in this area, anticipating more benefits in 2027 and beyond.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .",

      "Content": "Applied Materials AMAT shares have risen 7.6% in a month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s decline of 1.6% and 0.1%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe rise in the stock price has made AMAT a premium, as it trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.67, which is above the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s P/S ratio of 8.46.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven AMAT’s stock price rise in the past month and its overvaluation at present, investors might question: Should they buy, hold or sell the stock? Let’s discuss the fundamentals in detail.\n\nAMAT specializes in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Recent launches like Xtera epi, Kinex hybrid bonding, and PROVision 10 eBeam will add to AMAT’s growth story.\n\nAMAT expects next-generation technologies to be produced in large volume, which means that the company’s customers will be ramping up their foundries, naturally benefiting AMAT’s business. In 2025, AMAT strengthened its leadership in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50%. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\n\nAMAT expects its leading-edge foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory and high bandwidth memory to be the fastest-growing wafer fabrication equipment businesses in 2026. AMAT’s advanced packaging business, which is currently valued at $1.5 billion, is still on track to double to $3 billion over the next few years, driven by HBM demand and next-generation packaging architectures.\n\nThese factors will contribute to increased traction in Applied Materials’ wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), driven by growing usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing. AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT restructured its pricing program, and it is expected to contribute most of the 120-bps gross margin expansion in the coming fiscal year. This cost restructuring will further provide AMAT with enough headroom to ramp up its R&D investments. AMAT is setting up the Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization center for research, which is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nApplied Materials is winning over its competition like KLA Corporation KLAC, Lam Research LRCX and ASML Holding ASML in the semiconductor supply chain market.\n\nLam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT.

      "Content": "Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) shares rose after the company -- which sells critical design architecture for making semiconductors -- saw artificial intelligence (AI) demand boost its revenue. The stock, however, has still lost about a third of its value over the past year and it faces a big potential risk next fiscal year. Let's see what that is -- and what investors should do.\n\nAfter an initial dip following its results, Arm shares rallied as investors turned their focus more toward its AI opportunities than worries about smartphones. Arm said it sees its data center business becoming its largest segment in the coming year, and that it will reach a 50% market share among top hyperscalers. This growth is being led by the shift toward inference and AI agents, which it says makes central processing units (CPUs) more important within the data center.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nHowever, the company did admit that increasing memory supply constraints could put a dent in smartphone sales, with talk of a potential 15% reduction in volumes over the next year. That said, it noted that even a 20% reduction would only equate to a 2% to 4% effect on its smartphone royalties. However, this company is trading at a growth multiple, so that is a big potential risk.\n\nOverall, Arm's fiscal third-quarter revenue jumped 26% year over year to $1.24 billion. License revenue rose by 25% year over year to $505 million. Its agreement with Softbank contributed $200 million to that total. It increased its number of Arm Total Access licenses in the quarter by two, to 50. Over half of its top 30 customers use this license. It also added six Arm Flexible Access customers, bringing the total to 318.\n\nRoyalty revenue, meanwhile, rose 27% year over year to $737 million. The growth was driven by increased adoption of newer ARM technology, including Armv9 architecture and Arm CSS (compute subsystems), which carry higher royalty rates. It said five customers are now shipping devices with CSS chips, including the top four Android phone makers.\n\nAnnualized contract value (ACV), which smooths out license revenue, soared 28% to $1.62 billion. Looking ahead, Arm guided for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to come in around $1.47 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%. Royalty growth is projected to be up by the low teens and licensing by the high teens. It forecasts that adjusted earnings per share will be between $0.54 and 0.62.\n\nArm's licensing and royalty business model is attractive given its high gross margin and recurring nature, and the company has an opportunity to continue to grow nicely in the data center space. Meanwhile, its ties to Softbank provide a steady stream of growth.\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 49 based on analysts' fiscal 2027 consensus, and a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.7 (with below 1 considered undervalued), ARM looks reasonably priced. However, the likely weakness in the smartphone market next year isn't necessarily embedded in those estimates, and as such, this would keep me on the sidelines for now.",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvts-trades-premium-valuation-hold-151800624.html",
      "Content": "Navitas Semiconductor NVTS is currently trading at a high price-to-sales (P/S) multiple compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Navitas Semiconductor’s forward 12-month P/S ratio sits at 49.54X, significantly higher than the industry’s forward 12-month P/S ratio of 8.26X. The Zacks Value Score of F also suggests that NVTS stock is overvalued.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor stock trades at a higher P/S multiple compared with other industry peers, including Lam Research LRCX, Applied Materials AMAT and FormFactor FORM. At present, Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have P/S multiples of 11.58X, 8.46X and 7.69X, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s elevated valuation raises concerns about whether the stock can justify such lofty multiples. Considering the premium valuation, investors must be wondering whether they should buy, hold or sell the stock, especially amid near-term challenges.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor has decided to walk away from its low-margin mobile products to focus its resources on high-power business. This strategic decision is hurting the company’s top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2025, NVTS’s revenues decreased 53.4% year over year to $10.1 million, reflecting adverse impacts from its strategic decision to deprioritize its lower-margin China mobile business.\n\nThe company projects a further decline in its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2025. Navitas Semiconductor expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenues to be $7 million (+/- $0.25 million), down significantly on a sequential basis as the company is pruning its low-margin mobile business to align its resources toward high-power business.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s decision to prune its mobile business seems to have weighed on investors’ sentiments, as reflected by a decline in NVTS’ share price over the past three months. NVTS stock has plunged 11% over the past month, underperforming the industry’s decline of 2.7%.\n\nThe stock has underperformed its industry peers, including Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor. Shares of Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have returned 3.8%, 7.6% and 31%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, for investors, not everything is gloom and doom.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is shifting its focus toward high-power markets, such as AI data centers, performance computing, energy and grid infrastructure, and industrial electrification. This strategic move aligns with the company’s “Navitas 2.0” strategy, under which the company is reallocating resources toward high-power markets, pruning lower-margin mobile business, and working more closely with hyperscalers, graphics processing unit vendors and system OEMs.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s inclusion in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt AI factory ecosystem is an important step. The new architecture shifts data center power distribution from traditional AC/DC stages to a high-voltage DC approach that requires faster, more efficient power electronics. This creates an opening for Navitas Semiconductor’s gallium nitride (GaN) and high-voltage silicon carbide (SiC) technologies, both of which are now part of the NVIDIA-led ecosystem.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Navitas Semiconductor highlighted that it is one of the few companies offering both GaN and SiC solutions across the full power path from the grid to the graphics processing unit. The company has begun sampling mid-voltage GaN devices at 100 volts, which target the last stage of power conversion inside AI servers. It is also sampling 2.3 kV and 3.3 kV SiC modules for grid and energy storage applications that support these new data center designs.\n\nNVTS expects 2026 to be a transition year, with small but growing shipments tied to traditional server power supplies. The larger opportunity depends on how fast hyperscalers adopt the 800-volt architecture and will depend on Navitas Semiconductor's ability to secure multi-generation design wins.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is strengthening its position in high-power markets through strategic partnerships. In mid-December, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its distribution relationship with Avnet, making the latter a globally franchised distribution partner. Under the deal, Avnet will provide technical and commercial support for NVTS’ GaN and SiC products across regions.\n\nIn early December, NVTS entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Cyient Semiconductors to accelerate GaN adoption in India. The two companies plan to co-develop GaN products, system modules and design platforms aimed at high-voltage, high-power markets, such as AI data centers, electric mobility and grid infrastructure.\n\nIn late November, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its partnership with WT Microelectronics in Asia. NVTS is consolidating its distributor base, and WT Microelectronics will take the lead for customer engagement and logistics in Asia, per the partnership agreement. This collaboration is meant to improve support for high-power customers in the region.\n\nIn mid-November, Navitas Semiconductor announced a long-term partnership with GlobalFoundries. Under this collaboration, the two companies will develop and manufacture next-generation GaN power devices at Global Foundries’ Vermont facility, with development planned for early 2026 and production expected later that year.\n\nThese partnerships bode well for the company's prospects as Navitas Semiconductor is trying to prepare for future demand. Through these strategic partnerships, NVTS aims to strengthen its supply chain, improve customer access, and prepare for large future opportunities, once high-power markets begin to scale in 2026 and 2027.\n\nNVTS shares are trading above their 50-day & 200-day moving averages, a bullish technical signal that indicates the potential for continued upward momentum in the near term.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is in a good position to benefit from the fast growth of AI data centers and is making steady progress through its strategic partnerships, which bode well for the company’s prospects and support its long-term growth plans. The company’s GaN and high-voltage SiC products now play a role in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt power setup, which shows that the technology is relevant and in demand.\n\nHowever, Navitas Semiconductor’s premium valuation warrants a cautious approach to the stock.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lam-research-stocks-high-p-150000625.html",
      "Content": "Lam Research Corporation LRCX, a leader in semiconductor fabrication equipment, currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38.14, significantly higher than the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry average of 32.\n\nLRCX’s P/E multiple is also higher than that of some other semiconductor fabrication equipment providers, including KLA Corporation KLAC, Onto Innovation Inc. ONTO and Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT. At present, KLA Corporation, Onto Innovation and Applied Materials have a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 34.16, 33.78 and 31.60, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLRCX’s lofty valuation multiple is a result of robust appreciation in its share price. In the trailing 12 months, Lam Research shares have soared 174.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 35.1%. It has also outpaced the returns of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation. Shares of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation have rallied 90%, 80.4% and 21.6%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough it seems investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock, the billion-dollar question is: Is it justified to overpay?\n\nIn our opinion, Lam Research’s strong growth prospects amid artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand for advanced nodes justify this premium valuation. The company’s high growth potential in AI and high-performance computing (HPC) markets, along with back-to-back quarters of strong financial performance, suggest that LRCX stock’s upward momentum is far from over.\n\nDespite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical issues, and trade and tariff wars, LRCX’s financials remain impressive. In the company’s last reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, total revenues rose 22% year over year to $5.34 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%, primarily driven by continued demand across the Systems and Customer Support Business Group segments.\n\nLam Research reported second-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.27 per share, which beat the consensus mark by 8.5%. The bottom line also increased 39.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nLam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation Quote\n\nExpanding its manufacturing operations in Asia has also helped the company lower costs and improve margins. In the second quarter, Lam Research’s non-GAAP operating margin rose to 34.3%, up 360 basis points from the year-ago quarter, which is impressive, considering the challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThis strong financial performance reinforces Lam Research’s resilience in navigating an evolving semiconductor cycle. As demand grows for advanced nodes, LRCX’s specialized technology in etch and deposition tools for high-aspect-ratio structures positions it well to capitalize on this trend. The company’s second-quarter results also highlight its effective cost management, which has enabled sustained profitability.\n\nLam Research is capitalizing on AI trends. It builds the tools chipmakers need to manufacture next-generation semiconductors, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and chips used in advanced packaging. These technologies are vital for powering AI and cloud data centers.\n\nLam Research’s products are not only critical but also innovative. For example, its ALTUS ALD tool uses molybdenum to improve speed and efficiency in chip production. Another product, the Aether platform, helps chipmakers achieve higher performance and density. These are essential capabilities as demand for advanced AI chips continues to increase.\n\nIn 2025, Lam Research’s revenues from advanced packaging grew significantly, and management anticipates strong 40% year-over-year growth for 2026. The industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents growth opportunities for LRCX’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.\n\nThese trends are aiding Lam Research’s financial performance.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-txn-reliance-international-141502723.html",
      "Content": "Have you evaluated the performance of Texas Instruments' (TXN) international operations for the quarter ending December 2025? Given the extensive global presence of this chipmaker, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nInternational market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.\n\nWhile analyzing TXN's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.42 billion, showing rise of 10.4%. We will now explore the breakdown of TXN's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\n\nDuring the quarter, Japan contributed $290 million in revenue, making up 6.6% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $297.43 million, this meant a surprise of -2.5%. Looking back, Japan contributed $313 million, or 6.6%, in the previous quarter, and $277 million, or 6.9%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nRest of World generated $98 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 2.2% of the total. This represented a surprise of +26.34% compared to the $77.57 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of World accounted for $74 million (1.6%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $69 million (1.7%) to the total revenue.\n\nOf the total revenue, $948 million came from Europe, Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 21.4%. This represented a surprise of +3.13% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $919.21 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $972 million, or 20.5%, and $786 million, or 19.6%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nRest of Asia accounted for 10.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $457 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -4.19%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $476.96 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Rest of Asia contributed $505 million (10.7%) and $432 million (10.8%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nChina generated $951 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 21.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +1.9% compared to the $933.3 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, China accounted for $1.02 billion (21.5%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $821 million (20.5%) to the total revenue.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Texas Instruments to report $4.51 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 11% from the year-ago quarter. Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to contribute 6.5% (translating to $293.26 million), 1.7% ($77.37 million), 20.5% ($925.54 million), 10.5% ($473.62 million), and 20.7% ($933.44 million) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $19.36 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 9.5% from the year before. The revenues from Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to make up 6.4%, 1.7%, 20%, 10.3%, and 20.5% of this total, corresponding to $1.24 billion, $322.14 million, $3.86 billion, $2 billion, and $3.97 billion, respectively.\n\nTexas Instruments' reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\n\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\n\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\n\nTexas Instruments, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .\n\nOver the past month, the stock has gained 15.7% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, of which Texas Instruments is a part, has declined 1.1% over the same period. The company's shares have increased 41.2% over the past three months compared to the S&P 500's 3.7% increase. Over the same period, the sector has risen 2.3%\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.",

      "Content": "The S&P 500 is off to a fairly underwhelming start. As of Monday's close, it was up less than 2% since January. Many growth stocks have been struggling, while dividend stocks are suddenly becoming hot buys.\n\nTwo dividend stocks that are off to hot starts since the beginning of the year are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) . They have soared past the broad index, and here's why it might not be too late to invest in them.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nEntering trading on Tuesday, Lockheed Martin's stock was up 32% year to date. It's a fantastic performance after an unexciting year in 2025, when its share price was flat.\n\nThe company posted some strong earnings numbers at the end of January, reporting that its backlog was a record $194 billion. Its numbers came in better than its own expectations, and the business said it experienced \"unprecedented demand\" in the previous year. With strong government relationships and more growth expected for 2026, it's little wonder the defense stock has been a good buy early on.\n\nIts yield of 2.2% is also about twice what you'd get with the average S&P 500 stock right now. And at 21 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst projections), it's not an expensive stock to own, either. For long-term investors, Lockheed Martin can be a great stock to buy and hold.\n\nAnother stock that's been red hot to start 2026 is semiconductor company Texas Instruments. It's up just over 26% and it also recently released its earnings numbers. For the last three months of 2025, its revenue of $4.4 billion rose by 10% year over year, as demand from data centers has been strong and driving a lot of growth for the business.\n\nIts diversified semiconductor business features more than 80,000 parts that help companies in various industries, making it an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33 is a bit high, but with some encouraging long-term growth prospects and its data center segment potentially being a catalyst for the foreseeable future, the stock can still be a suitable option for investors who are looking to buy and hold for years.\n\nTexas Instruments pays an above-average dividend that yields 2.6%, and it has been increasing its payout for 22 consecutive years. This is not only a promising growth investment, but also a terrific dividend stock to hang on to for the long haul.",

      "Content": "智原 (3035-TW) 今 (10) 日召開法說會，總經理王國雍指出，第一季營收約莫季減 10%，不過，隨著公司布局先進製程與先進封裝的效益逐步顯現，公司已拿下 5 奈米的專案，並有高達 9 個先進封裝的案件將在今年陸續量產，預計今年營運將季季高，全年營運樂觀看。\n智原預估，第一季營收季減約 10%，其中 IP 業務呈現季增，但 NRE 與量產 (MP) 營收同步下滑，單季毛利率約落在 45%。展望 2026 年，智原在扣除 2025 年一次性備料因素後，預估全年營收將呈現年增低雙位數 (11-13%) 幅度，其中 IP 業務穩定成長，NRE 顯著放大，量產營收則逐步走升，對中長期營運維持審慎樂觀態度。\n王國雍表示，公司正積極爭取先進製程與先進封裝新案，去年先進製程共取得 5 個 Design win，不僅案件數量增加，製程節點也從 12/14 奈米推進至更先進節點，目前接案最先進製程已達 4 奈米，顯示接案結構出現明顯質變，未來量產後可望帶來可觀營收貢獻。\n在先進封裝方面，智原指出，高階封裝與先進製程 ASIC 密不可分，公司從 SoC Die 設計切入，並以彈性商務模式串聯供應鏈。去年已取得 10 個先進封裝案件，涵蓋 2.5D 與 3D 封裝，今年預計將有 9 項產品陸續進入量產，並依專案進度逐步放量，預期第四季貢獻度最高。\n同時，智原持續提升國際客戶比重，去年國際客戶開案占比已達 6 成，客戶遍及歐美與日本，應用領域多與雲端 AI 相關，包括 Smart NIC 與特殊領域的 AI 加速器等。\n展望 2026 年，智原點出四大關鍵趨勢，將逐步轉化為公司長期成長動能，包括專用型 AI、邊緣與終端 AI、ASIC 資源排擠效應，以及晶圓廠產能排擠效應。智原指出，金融與健康醫療等專用型 AI 應用市場正逐步打開，公司近期已接獲相關案件；AI 運算架構也持續由雲端向邊緣端擴散。另一方面，雲端服務業者 (CSP) 積極自研 ASIC，排擠設計資源，反而突顯智原既有設計能量與整合能力的優勢。\n在產能端，智原觀察到先進製程需求外溢效應，不僅影響 ASIC 開案資源，也延伸至晶圓廠端，相關產能需求轉向與智原合作的晶圓代工夥伴。\n智原進一步指出，2025 年將是業務結構新舊交替期，自今年起營運將出現結構性改變，除了成熟製程逐步復甦，更重要的是先進製程快速擴張。目前先進製程需求已「爆棚」，已有超過 10 個 FinFET 專案進入設計階段，並將於今年開始貢獻營收。\n公司預期，今年第一季為全年營運谷底，隨著 9 顆先進封裝產品於年底前量產，全年營運將呈現季季高走勢。上半年成長動能以 NRE 為主，下半年除 FinFET 量產營收外，先進封裝貢獻也將同步放大，下半年表現可望明顯優於上半年。",

      "Content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus .\n\nAmazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) Web Services appears to be tightening its grip on critical data-center infrastructure by deepening its relationship with STMicroelectronics NV ( NYSE:STM ), as the cloud unit looks to secure a broader range of semiconductor technologies for its hyperscale operations. Under the agreement disclosed on Monday, STMicro will supply AWS with chips supporting high-bandwidth connectivity and energy-efficient power management, components that are increasingly relevant as AI workloads place heavier demands on data-center performance and power efficiency. The structure of the deal suggests AWS is positioning itself not just as a customer, but as a long-term partner as global data-center build-outs accelerate.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN.\n\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nAlongside the commercial supply arrangement, AWS received warrants to acquire up to 24.8 million ordinary STMicro shares, with vesting linked to AWS's purchases of STMicro products over time. The warrants can be exercised over a seven-year period at an initial exercise price of $28.38, giving AWS the flexibility to build an equity position in stages. STMicro shares rose 6.5% at the market open to $26.51 following the announcement, while for AWS the move represents at least its second investment in a semiconductor company, reinforcing the view that cloud operators could increasingly blend procurement and capital allocation to secure strategic supply.\n\nThe backdrop to the agreement is a widening semiconductor opportunity driven by AI-related data-center investment, where demand is extending beyond advanced processors into analog chips used for power management, sensing, and cooling. STMicro, which supplies customers such as Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), recently forecast first-quarter revenue that came in above analysts' expectations, with consumer electronics demand showing signs of recovery late last year after a prolonged slump. At the same time, management has cautioned that the rebound remains uneven, with Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery noting that the automotive market is not yet stable, suggesting that AI-driven infrastructure demand could be an important, though not uniform, support for the company's outlook.",

      "Content": "Applied Materials AMAT is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 12.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, AMAT expects revenues to be $6.85 billion (+/- $500 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.89 billion, suggesting a decline of 3.87% from the year-ago quarter’s reading.\n\nApplied Materials projects non-GAAP earnings to be $2.18 (+/- $0.20). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.19 per share, indicating a decline of 7.98% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The figure has remained unchanged in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMAT has an impressive earnings surprise history. AMAT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 4.17%.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for AMAT this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($2.26 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.19 per share), is +3.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: AMAT carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nAMAT’s wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) is experiencing increased demand due to a rise in the usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing (HPC). In the previous quarter, AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT’s flash memory or NAND sales nearly doubled to $1.41 billion in fiscal 2025 from the year-ago sales of $747.4 million. Although AMAT has a lower market share in the NAND space, it is gaining prominence. This trend is likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, supporting AMAT’s top-line growth.\n\nApplied Materials’ leadership in GAA transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips, are likely to have driven AMAT’s semiconductor segment in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nAMAT’s display business has rebounded in the fiscal 2025 with year-over-year growth of 19.8%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the display revenues grew 68.2% year over year as Applied Materials shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly. These factors are likely to have benefited AMAT’s corporate and other segment’s revenues.\n\nThe company’s Applied Global Services segment is also likely to have seen steady growth, aided by strong demand for comprehensive service agreements and the expansion of its subscription-based business.\n\nApplied Materials shares have gained 74.9% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which has gained 19.4%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet us now look at the value Applied Materials offers to its investors at current levels. AMAT is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 8.46X compared with the industry’s 8.26X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApplied Materials operates in a highly competitive market space where it faces competition from players, including Lam Research LRCX in the semiconductor space, ASML Holding ASML in the photolithography and advanced manufacturing equipment segment. KLA Corporation KLAC is a dominant competitor in the wafer inspection space.\n\nFor instance, Lam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although developing solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holding develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions, such as Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\n\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\n\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nAMAT is gaining from continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and HPC. AMAT’s HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology technologies are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Considering these factors, we suggest investors buy this stock now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cirrus-logic-inc-crus-soars-141505325.html",
      "Content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS) ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $144.76 in the previous session. Cirrus Logic has gained 20.5% since the start of the year compared to the -0.6% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 3.2% return for the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry.\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 3, 2026, Cirrus Logic reported EPS of $2.97 versus consensus estimate of $2.42.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Cirrus Logic is expected to post earnings of $8.51 per share on $1.94 in revenues. This represents a 12.86% change in EPS on a 2.35% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.77 per share on $2.03 in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.03% and 4.48%, respectively.\n\nThough Cirrus Logic has recently hit a 52-week high, what is next for Cirrus Logic? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). The individual style scores for Value, Growth, Momentum and the combined VGM Score run from A through F. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nCirrus Logic has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 37.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.4X versus its peer group's average of 23.4X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cirrus Logic currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cirrus Logic fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Cirrus Logic shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nShares of CRUS have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) . AMAT has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of D, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of A.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Applied Materials, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 2.84%, and for the current fiscal year, AMAT is expected to post earnings of $9.62 per share on revenue of $29.17 billion.\n\nShares of Applied Materials, Inc. have gained 7.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 33.53X and a P/CF of 31.95X.\n\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is in the top 25% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CRUS and AMAT, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Wall Street offered a muted performance last week. The S&P 500 lost 0.1%, the Dow Jones added 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.8%. The key event of the week was the tech stock rout. Wall Street has been skeptical about software stocks in recent times, but a phase of outright panic hit last week.\n\nTraders dumped shares across the sector as fears mount that artificial intelligence (AI) could fundamentally disrupt software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models.The anxiety intensified on Feb. 3, 2026, after AI startup Anthropic unveiled a productivity tool aimed at in-house lawyers. The announcement triggered a sharp selloff in legal software and publishing stocks, per Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\n\nMeanwhile, six out of all Mag 7 members have reported their Q4 results, with just NVDA remaining. Alphabet and Amazon reported last week.Amazon missed EPS estimates, but the business is otherwise in great shape.\n\nAmazon plans to spend $200 billion in capital expenditures in 2026, up from $132 billion in 2025 and $83 billion in 2024. While Amazon remains the cloud leader, the Alphabet report showed accelerating momentum at the search giant&rsquo;s Google Cloud business (read: Amazon Drops on Mixed Q4 & Capex Outlook: Buy the Dip With ETFs?).\n\nIn a nutshell, combining the actual results for the six Magnificent 7 members that have reported already along with estimates for Nvidia, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up 24.2% from the same period last year on 18.9% higher revenues, which would follow the group&rsquo;s 28.3% earnings growth on 18.1% revenue growth in 2025 Q3, per Zacks Earnings Trends.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight the winning leveraged ETFs of last week.\n\nTradr 2X Long LITE Daily ETF LITX &ndash; Up 79.5%\n\nLumentum Holdings Inc LITE stock surged 36.3% last week on the earnings strength. Lumentum's Q1 2026 revenues rose 58% year over year to $533.8 million, topping estimates by 1.43%. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.10 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.8%, driven by AI and cloud strength. The company offered an upbeat outlook, too.\n\nTradr 2X Long ENPH Daily ETF ENPX &ndash; Up 67.7%\n\nEnphase Energy ENPH shares rose 35.8% last week. Enphase last weekreported fourth-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of 71 cents per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents by 31.5%.Enphase Energy&rsquo;s fourth-quarter revenues of $343.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $335 million by 2.6%.\n\nTradr 2X Short IREN Daily ETF IREZ &ndash; Up 37.1%\n\nIREN Ltd IREN lost about 20.1% last week, lending a surge to the double-leveraged IREN ETF. Last week, IREN came with a Q2 FY26 loss of 44 cents per share as revenues slid 23.1% sequentially and missed estimates. Total revenues fell 23.1% sequentially to $184.7 million, missing the consensus estimate by 16.49%. Bitcoin revenues fell 28.2% quarter on quarter. However, AI cloud services revenues jumped 137% from the prior quarter.\n\nT-Rex 2X Long ARM Daily Target ETF ARMU) &ndash; Up 35.0%\n\nArm Holdings ARM gained about 18% last week. The stock gained on a strong fiscal third-quarter 2026 earnings report released on Feb. 4, 2026. The stock gained as investors focused on strong growth in AI and data center segments.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "When investors look at investing in computer chips to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they are likely to start with a company like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . That makes sense, given that it makes the most popular chips for handling AI workloads. However, there's another chip stock that could also turn out to be a huge AI winner: Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) .\n\nNvidia makes high-powered parallel processing chips that act as the primary brains that undergird AI software. Texas Instruments makes analog chips, the boring ones that convert physical events into digital signals. When you push a button on a digital device, it is likely being controlled by an analog chip. Texas Instruments' chips are simple, relatively low cost, and can be found in tech products virtually everywhere.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nIn the artificial intelligence hardware world, Texas Instruments' chips provide power management. That's a vital function within the data centers that house AI. Given the expectation that the AI infrastructure buildout is only just beginning, Texas Instruments could have years of growth ahead of it in this end market.\n\nOver the last few years, the analog chip sector has been in a rut. However, Texas Instruments has been investing in new chip production capacity. Just recently, it agreed to buy competitor Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) . In other words, Texas Instruments is preparing for growth.\n\nIt is also shifting the way it reports its sales. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the company broke out its data center business as a separate end market. The segment accounted for around 9% of the top line. However, it grew 64% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat's probably not a number to bake into your growth expectations, given that the AI opportunity is brand new. Still, revenue rose by a mid-single-digit percentage from the third quarter. If this is just the beginning of the AI buildout, this segment could help supercharge an upturn in the typically cyclical analog chip sector and support growth for years to come.\n\nThere are other analog chipmakers , and there are chipmakers that make more exciting chips than Texas Instruments. However, for most investors, opening a position in this industry-leading company will probably set you up for long-term success. And given the strength of the business and the company's growth efforts, the AI buildout could easily turn Texas Instruments into a top-performing chipmaker by 2027, if not sooner.",

      "Content": "Headquartered in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) designs and delivers advanced chips across processors, connectivity, analog, security, and sensor technologies. With a market cap of roughly $56.5 billion, the company forms the invisible backbone of vehicles, factories, Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, mobile devices, and modern communications infrastructure.\n\nWhile the business footprint looks expansive, stock performance has introduced a more restrained narrative. Over the past 52 weeks, NXPI stock gained 3.5%, trailing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) 14% gain. Year-to-date (YTD), however, the stock rose 3.3%, edging past the broader index’s modest 1.3% increase.\n\nInflation, Earnings and Other Key Things to Watch this Week\n\nWhy Alphabet's Free Cash Flow Could Survive, Despite the Market's Fears - How to Play GOOGL\n\nShould You Buy AT&T Stock After Its Amazon Leo Win?\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nPlacing that performance within the sector sharpens perspective. The State Street SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) surged 45.3% over the same 52-week period and added 11.6% YTD.\n\nOn Feb. 2, NXP Semiconductors reported its Q4 2025 earnings results, immediately lifting the stock 2.2%. Revenue grew 7.2% year over year to $3.34 billion, topping the $3.3 billion analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS rose 5.3% to $3.35, clearing Wall Street’s $3.30 forecast with room to spare.\n\nDespite beating headline estimates, NXPI stock slid 4.5% in the next trading session as investors focused on elevated inventories and emerging signs of long-term margin pressure. However, management countered with a strategic reset anchored in “physical artificial intelligence (AI),” emphasizing accelerating demand for industrial products with built-in intelligence at the edge.\n\nLeadership also cited stronger regional manufacturing amid geopolitical pressure. As automakers stop trimming orders and inventory correction fades, management now sees visibility into growth from next-generation, AI-enabled products.\n\nThe outlook carries into the forward estimates. For fiscal year 2026, ending in December, analysts project diluted EPS of $12.37, implying 21.3% year-over-year growth. Importantly, NXP Semiconductors has beaten EPS expectations in three of the past four quarters, missing only once.\n\nWall Street sentiment remains firmly supportive, assigning NXPI stock an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Out of 30 analysts, 22 rate NXPI stock a “Strong Buy,” two recommend “Moderate Buy,” and six suggest “Hold.”\n\nImportantly, the outlook remains unchanged from three months ago, when 22 analysts also labeled the stock a “Strong Buy.”\n\nWhile NXPI stock has lagged peers from a growth standpoint, recent demand commentary appears stronger than that of many competitors. Reinforcing this view, TD Cowen raised its price target to $285 from $260 on Jan. 16 while maintaining a “Buy” rating on the stock.\n\nLooking ahead, analyst targets paint a clearer picture of what the market believes the stock can deliver. NXPI’s average price target of $259.67 implies potential upside of 15.8%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $324.40 suggests a gain of 44.6% from current levels.",

      "Content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nIf you are looking to be consoled after 25% in value was sliced off your software stock holdings this week, then click out of this and go about your day.\n\nBecause I'm not here to offer up sloppy kisses and warm hugs. I'm in a mood to dish out some pain on two fronts. One is to you — the investors I love so much — as these painful losses could have been avoided. All you had to do was what I have suggested time and time again: take frequent pulse checks in the companies you own.\n\nSo many software stocks were priced for perfection (and still are) coming into the year, and the backdrop was far from perfect. AI updates out of Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) are calling into question the long-term value of software companies.\n\nMeanwhile, these stocks were bid up to aggressive valuations in part because of hopes of additional interest rate cuts. Well, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told you last week those weren't coming anytime soon. And the Kevin Warsh announcement as Fed chair nominee hasn't helped matters.\n\nThe entire software investment thesis has been blown up.\n\nI also want to hand out pain to a few tech companies that I lightly touched on during Opening Bid late in the week.\n\nFirst, Qualcomm ( QCOM ).\n\nQualcomm's guidance stunk, and the sell-off on Thursday was deserved. The company called out weakness in the smartphone market, largely due to the global memory chip shortage. Execs said this dynamic could persist into 2027.\n\nAn outlook like this should have been teed up by management three months ago. Come on, guys, do better!\n\nExpect Qualcomm shares to stay in the penalty box.\n\n\"Smartphone headwinds an ongoing concern; AI chip potential still unclear,\" HSBC analyst Frank Lee said.\n\nThe next tech giant in line is chip player Arm Holdings ( ARM ).\n\nArm also served up some less-than-savory guidance, blaming memory chip shortages. Keep in mind that Arm designs the architecture that forms ⁠the basis of a large chunk of the ‌world's smartphone chips. That leaves it with the prospect of subdued royalty sales amid soft mobile processor sales.\n\nSimilar to what I just said about Qualcomm, Arm execs should've done a better job guiding investors to these challenges.\n\nInstead, investors in both companies are left holding the bag. Arm shares are also likely to stay in the penalty box.\n\nAnd I know you want me to lay into Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) for shocking the hell out of everyone by calling out up to $185 billion in capital expenditures this year. The Street estimate was around $120 billion.\n\nBut I'm not going to lay into Alphabet for one simple reason: The fundamentals of its business are so strong that you can justify this level of spending. Check out these two random numbers I yanked from the earnings call transcript .\n\nIn October, YouTube viewers watched more than 700 million hours of podcasts on living room devices, up 75% from a year ago.\n\nThe company has 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise, which it launched just four months ago. And the Gemini app now has more than 750 million monthly active users. These are huge numbers that should have OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) quaking in its boots.\n\n\"The quarter strengthen thesis that: 1) Google search activity will accelerate from new AI use cases (not losing queries to OpenAI), 2) AI can structurally drive higher Search monetization, 3) Gemini large language models and TPUs are cloud competitive advantages, and 4) Cloud capex is high return on investment, and more capacity will accelerate cloud growth,\" BofA analyst Justin Post said.\n\nIs this coming week one where you bottom-hunt in software? I will leave you with this thought: Have you ever tried catching a falling knife with bare hands? My point exactly.\n\nI've had the good fortune of being in finance in various capacities for 22 years. And a lot of you remember when I was an analyst writing research reports and making stock calls. I appreciate you riding with me all these years. You have told me lately that you miss me picking stocks.\n\nI feel you, but this is a different point in my life and career. However, I will try to do a better job at whipping up short analyses when possible on stocks that leave an impression on me one way or another.\n\nTo that end...\n\nHailey Bieber's power to drive the cosmetics industry seemingly has no bounds.\n\nThat's one of my thoughts as I reran the numbers this week on e.l.f. Beauty's ( ELF ) latest quarter, which was powered by the company spending $1 billion to buy Bieber's cosmetics brand, Rhode, last August. E.l.f. hiked its top- and bottom-line outlooks for the year because of momentum with Rhode, but also because of new shelf space wins at Walmart ( WMT ) and Dollar General ( DG ).\n\nYet the stock sold off by 6% on Thursday. It's off by 63% from the February 2024 highs.\n\nI don't love the cosmetics industry. It's volatile, competitive, and very hit-driven. But I will say this: The Street could be missing things a little on e.l.f.\n\nI liked what CEO Tarang Amin told me about demand trends for Rhode on Opening Bid and how the core business of lower-priced cosmetics is performing at major retailers. I also like that the company has gained a lot of new shelf space at those aforementioned two retailers, as well as Target ( TGT ).\n\nTake that for what it is.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is one of the worst AI stocks to invest in according to Reddit . On February 5, New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu upgraded Arm Holdings to Buy from Neutral.\n\nHowever, on the same day, Jefferies lowered its price target for Arm Holdings to $170 from $205 with a Buy rating. Despite strong results and guidance, the firm noted that Arm’s shares faced pressure due to investor concerns that rising memory prices could reduce smartphone sales volumes. However, the firm clarified that while price hikes primarily affect the low-to-mid-end market, Arm’s growth is driven by high-end smartphone chips that utilize v9 and CSS architectures.\n\nKeyBanc also lowered its price target for Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) to $170 from $200 and kept an Overweight rating, despite the company delivering strong Q3 2025 results and raising its Q4 guidance. The firm noted that Arm exceeded expectations in both royalties and licensing, but management acknowledged that rising memory prices and supply shortages are expected to dampen handset royalty growth.\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) architects, develops, and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies for semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Q1 beat expectations: Skyworks reported revenue of roughly $1.035–1.04 billion and non‑GAAP EPS of $1.54 (about $0.14 above the midpoint), with a 46.6% gross margin, $339 million in free cash flow, ~$1.6 billion in cash and $1 billion in debt.\n\nMobile concentration and near‑term guidance: The largest customer drove ~67% of revenue and mobile was 62% of sales; management expects a ~20% sequential decline in mobile for Q2, guiding revenue to $875–925 million and midpoint EPS of $1.04 while broad markets remain steady.\n\nQorvo merger on track: Skyworks reiterated the planned combination with Qorvo as transformative, targeting more than $500 million of synergies and combined gross margins of 50–55% through cycles, with closing expected in early 2027 pending approvals.\n\nInterested in Skyworks Solutions, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nMarketBeat Week in Review – 06/23 - 6/27\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) reported fiscal first-quarter 2026 results that exceeded the high end of its guidance range, citing upside in both mobile and broad markets. Management also reiterated its expectations and timeline for the company’s previously announced combination with Qorvo, while emphasizing that the call’s focus would remain on quarterly performance and near-term outlook.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, Skyworks posted revenue of $1.035 billion to $1.04 billion, which management said exceeded the high end of the company’s guidance range. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.54, which CFO Philip Carter said was $0.14 above the midpoint of guidance.\n\n→ The New Defense Prime: Ondas Buys the Kill Chain\n\nSkyworks Stock Down 16% in 2025, Poised for AI Edge Surge\n\nGross profit was $482 million with gross margin of 46.6%. Operating expenses were $230 million, at the low end of guidance, resulting in operating income of $252 million and an operating margin of 24.3%. Other income was $6 million and the effective tax rate was 10%, producing net income of $232 million.\n\nSkyworks generated $396 million in operating cash flow and spent $57 million on capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $339 million, or a 33% free cash flow margin. The company paid $106 million in quarterly dividends and ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $1 billion in debt.\n\n→ Insiders Rang in the New Year Selling These Stocks, Buyers Beware\n\nCirrus Logic Stock Surges on Strong Apple iPhone Upgrade Cycle\n\nManagement said the company’s largest customer accounted for approximately 67% of revenue during the quarter, consistent with the prior quarter. Mobile represented 62% of total revenue, coming in above expectations due to what Skyworks described as healthy sell-through at its top customer and strong execution on new product launches.\n\nCEO Phil Brace said smartphone replacement cycles, while still lengthy, are “beginning to shorten,” which he tied to consumers upgrading more frequently as “AI-capable devices” and more integrated features reach the market. He added that the company had not seen demand impacts from broader industry discussions around component pricing and availability, and noted that channel inventory remains lean.\n\n→ Mag 7 Outlook: What Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla Just Told Us\n\nLooking ahead, Brace said Skyworks “successfully defended key mobile sockets” and gained content where architecture changes created opportunities, but also cautioned that product mix dynamics could moderate some of that progress. Based on current visibility, management expects blended mobile content to be “roughly flat year-over-year,” while reiterating that it would not comment on specific sockets, models, or launch timing.\n\nBroad markets delivered what management called its eighth consecutive quarter of growth, with revenue up double digits year-over-year. Carter said broad markets grew 4% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, driven by edge IoT, data center and cloud infrastructure, and automotive. Brace added that broad markets continues to deliver margins above the corporate average and benefits from “long cycle and multi-year” demand drivers.\n\nIn prepared remarks and during Q&A, management highlighted several areas of strength:\n\nEdge IoT and Wi‑Fi 7: Brace said Wi‑Fi 7 momentum continues to build due to higher throughput, lower latency, and reliability, and positioned it as an enabler as AI inference moves closer to the edge. He cited strong design win activity, a healthy backlog, and early engagement on Wi‑Fi 8 programs.\n\nAutomotive: Management characterized demand as solid, driven by increased connectivity across telematics, infotainment, and software-defined vehicle architectures. Brace said the pipeline is broad and global, aligned with long-cycle platforms across multiple OEMs and tiers.\n\nData center and networking: Brace said demand signals are improving, with increasing design win activity as the ecosystem transitions to next-generation 800G and emerging 1.6T architectures. He highlighted expansion in timing and power management content, including “jitter attenuating clocks” and power isolation products, and later said data center is growing faster than overall broad markets and delivering better-than-corporate-average margins.\n\nBrace also noted longer-term interest in satellite communications, while saying it was not yet large enough to discuss in detail.\n\nFor the fiscal second quarter of 2026, Skyworks guided revenue to a range of $875 million to $925 million. Carter said mobile is expected to decline approximately 20% sequentially, consistent with seasonality, while broad markets is expected to be flat sequentially. Broad markets is projected to represent 44% of sales in Q2 and be up high single digits year-over-year.\n\nGross margin is projected at approximately 44.5% to 45.5%, reflecting seasonally lower volume. Operating expenses are expected to be between $230 million and $240 million as the company continues funding key R&D initiatives while controlling discretionary spending. Below the line, Skyworks anticipates about $4 million in other income, a 10% effective tax rate, and a diluted share count of 151 million. At the midpoint of revenue guidance ($900 million), management said this equates to expected diluted EPS of $1.04.\n\nIn response to questions on gross margin drivers, Carter said the quarter-to-quarter decline is “mostly due to typical seasonality in mobile and lower volume” and also cited a slightly higher mix of Android. He added that after three consecutive quarters of exceeding the high end of guidance, the company has incurred higher input costs such as expedite fees to meet on-time delivery targets.\n\nBrace opened the call by reiterating Skyworks’ view that its announced combination with Qorvo is “highly strategic and transformative,” citing expected benefits including greater scale, deeper R&D, a broader technology portfolio, reduced historical mobile volatility, and an expanded total addressable market into defense and aerospace. He pointed to an expected path to more than $500 million of synergies over time and said the combined company is expected to achieve gross margins through cycles in the 50% to 55% range, supported by operating leverage and enhanced earnings power.\n\nManagement said it has completed initial regulatory filings, scheduled a shareholder vote, and begun integration planning, while expecting a comprehensive regulatory review. Skyworks reiterated its expectation that the transaction will close in early calendar year 2027, subject to regulatory approvals, approval by both companies’ shareholders, and other customary closing conditions.\n\nDuring Q&A, Brace described the portfolios as complementary—highlighting Qorvo’s antenna-side capabilities—and said the combined company would have broader RF scale across the chain. Separately, Carter said Skyworks has “ample opportunity and cash” for capital deployment, but noted that during the pendency period there are requirements around buybacks and the company also expects to access debt markets in the next 12 months in anticipation of closing the transaction.\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc is a leading semiconductor company that designs and manufactures analog and mixed-signal semiconductors for use in radio frequency (RF) and mobile communications markets. The company's portfolio includes power amplifiers, front-end modules, switches, filters, low-noise amplifiers, and other components that enable wireless connectivity in smartphones, tablets, wearables, automotive telematics, and broadband infrastructure. With a focus on energy efficiency and integration, Skyworks serves a broad range of customers in the mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, connected home, and industrial end markets.\n\nHeadquartered in Irvine, California, Skyworks operates a network of design, development, and manufacturing facilities across North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe article \" Skyworks Solutions Q1 Earnings Call Highlights \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "Qorvo Inc. (NASDAQ: QRVO ) is one of the most undervalued stocks to buy and hold for 5 years . On January 27, Qorvo Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) reported healthy Q3 FY 2026 results, with revenue of $993.0 million, up 8.4% year over year but down 6.2% sequentially and modestly ahead of consensus. Adjusted EPS of $2.17 also came in ahead of the Street’s $1.86 estimate.\n\nThe company issued its revenue guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, which fell short of analysts’ current expectations. The company expects to report between $775.00 million and $825.00 million in revenue, below analysts’ $903.8 million forecast, and per-share profit of $1.05 to $1.35, just shy of the $1.37 Wall Street is projecting.\n\nQorvo Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) supplies radio-frequency chips to Apple, its largest customer, which accounts for about half of the company’s total revenue. Lower revenue expectations hint at a “seasonal” decline in demand from the iPhone maker, according to Qorvo CEO Bob Bruggeworth. The company is in the midst of a $22 billion cash-and-stock transaction to merge with its larger rival, Skyworks Solutions Inc., a deal announced in October 2025.\n\nQorvo Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) develops and sells technologies and products for wireless, wired, and power markets in the U.S., Asia, and Europe. The company’s services cater to fields such as defense and aerospace, 5G and 6G infrastructure, and connectivity and sensor technology, among others.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of QRVO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "美國市場甩開貴金屬、比特幣崩跌陰霾，在AI晶片概念股回溫下，加上科技巨擘在財報前走揚，美股穩住陣腳。道瓊工業指數上漲1.05%、那斯達克指數上揚0.56%、標普500指數走高0.54%，費城半導體指數反彈1.70%，半導體族群擺脫前一波急跌壓力。個股表現上，Alphabet、Amazon財報前夕買盤卡位，股價走揚；蘋果受OLED版MacBook Pro與M系列晶片題材激勵大漲；記憶體族群明顯回神，美光、Sandisk強勢反彈，帶動費半回溫。不過，輝達因市場傳出對OpenAI投資進度雜音，股價相對承壓；台積電ADR則隨半導體指數反彈同步走高3.27%，成為支撐美股科技盤勢重要一環。\n亞股全面反攻，日股飆漲破2千點，勁揚3.92%，韓股同樣激昂，飆漲6.84%；港股與陸股同步收漲，區域股市擺脫前一日修正陰霾明顯回升。\n回到台股，加權指數終場大漲571.33點，收在32,195.36點，漲幅1.81%，成功站回月線之上，成交金額7,962.51億元，資金回流態勢明確。權王 台積電(2330) 在ADR走強與先進製程題材支撐下穩盤，成為指數反彈核心；電子族群全面回溫，低軌衛星、探針卡等題材股輪番點火，成交熱度居高不下。整體來看，在美股科技股回穩、亞股齊揚與內資積極加碼支撐下，台股呈現量價齊揚、題材股接力輪動的強勢反彈格局。\n📝盤點熱門股：華邦電、旺宏、凱基台灣TOP50 今日熱門成交股方面，成交動能明顯集中在記憶體與面板族群，以及新掛牌ETF題材。記憶體族群 華邦電(2344) 、 旺宏(2337) 、 力積電(6770) 同步名列前五大成交股，股價表現偏弱，市場解讀，先前記憶體族群急漲後，短線籌碼鬆動，加上盤中傳出部分資金獲利了結與避險調節，導致買賣交投明顯放大，加上族群基本面並未出現新的利多支撐，使走勢轉為震盪整理。\n面板股 群創(3481) 同樣延續走弱格局，受面板報價與產業前景雜音影響，市場多空交戰加劇，成交熱絡主要來自短線資金換手。相較之下，新掛牌ETF 凱基台灣TOP50(009816) 股價走揚，市場關注焦點在於台積電帶動大盤強彈後的被動式資金布局與新產品話題，吸引買盤進場，使成交量能維持高檔，成為前五名中唯一收紅的標的。\n📌三大法人買賣超 三大法人今日合計買超110.10億元，資金面呈現偏多結構。外資續站買方，單日買超72.68億元，顯示在盤勢震盪下仍維持回補動作；投信買盤力道最為明確，買超106.34億元，成為推升盤勢的主要支撐；相較之下，自營商則偏向調節，單日賣超68.92億元，反映短線操作態度仍較保守。\n✨本日議題股：探針概念股 受日本青森大暴雪衝擊當地供應鏈影響，台廠迎來轉單題材，帶動探針卡、碳化矽族群同步點火，多檔個股強勢噴發；其中測試介面廠今年展望轉趨樂觀， 穎崴(6515) 、 精測(6510) 、 旺矽(6223) 今同步改寫新高紀錄，成為盤面資金追逐焦點。法人指出...... 點我看更多\n👥財經大人物： 去年市場一度傳出「街口要倒了」的耳語，甚至在巷弄間流竄，街口支付董事長梅驊親自聽聞後化身「第一線情報員」急踩煞車、對外說明穩軍心。他直言，台灣行動支付最大的挑戰不在技術，而在「不肯分享」的生態競爭結構，業者各守山頭，讓非現金社會推進卡關。面對LINE Pay等強敵環伺，梅驊強調街口選擇...... 點我看更多\n👁️‍🗨️ 憶如犀利講 2026年GDP不只保4！國發會今（3）日舉行年終記者會，主委葉俊顯公布2026年台灣經濟成長率目標上看4.56%。數字一出，不少專家直言「還是太保守」，畢竟2025年GDP最終衝破8.6%，改寫15年新高。\n國發會指出，2026年GDP成長率的基準預測為4.11%，目標值4.56%，不僅高於主計總處的3.54%、央行的3.67%，也優於台經院、台綜院預估，僅略低於中經院的4.14%。\n對此，統一投顧董事長黎方國直言，這個數字仍有上修空間。他指出，2025年初各界普遍只估成長3%，國發會第二季甚至認為下半年僅剩1%，結果卻一路上修，最終GDP飆破8.6%。如果去年那麼強，今年只剩4%，落差實在太大。\n黎方國提出兩大理由支撐樂觀展望。其一，美國去年第四季經濟成長率高達5%，遠超市場預期。川普推動關稅戰，目的就是促使製造業回流美國，美政府估算未來幾年投資金額高達18兆美元，遠高於過去每年約1兆美元的水準，加上年底美國期中選舉，政策力道只會更猛。2026製造業回美，台灣供應鏈勢必受惠。理由二，IMF元月最新報告幾乎全面上修多國GDP預估，包括美中日，黎方國認為，未來全球經濟成長率還有再上調的空間。\n不過，GDP上修，股市就一定會漲嗎？黎方國提醒投資人「別高興得太早」。他強調，基本面向好，並不必然等於股市上漲，真正左右行情的關鍵，往往是貨幣政策帶動的資金熱錢。\n他舉例，自21世紀以來，全球僅在2009年與2020年出現經濟負成長，但台股2020年卻暴漲78%，關鍵就在聯準會大規模QE、資金氾濫。反觀2022年，台積電、聯發科獲利創歷史新高，股價卻因升息循環而重挫。\n因此，GDP目標再漂亮，也可能被緊縮的貨幣政策抵銷。近期市場對聯準會新主席候選人華許「鴿皮鷹骨」的疑慮升溫，全球金融市場震盪，其實正反映同樣的邏輯。\n2026年台灣經濟「保4」究竟是利多，還是已被市場消化？股市投資人怎麼看，明天台股的反應，或許就能見真章。",
